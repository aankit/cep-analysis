Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The mission of The International High School for Health Sciences is to help new non-English speaking students acquire 
English language skills and develop the determination, compassion, and discipline for successful college study in 
medicine, nursing, health counseling, research or in the administration of health care services. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The International High School for Health Sciences is entering our sixth year; we graduated our second class as of June 
2018. Our student population is made up entirely of diverse newcomer immigrant students, who have resided in the 
United States anywhere from one week to three years.  

Our mainstay partnerships are with The Internationals Network for Public Schools (INPS) and the National Academy 
Foundation (which supports our CTE work). In addition, our juniors all serve one semester internships at local sites 
including area hospitals, the New York Hall of Science and many others. We have an ongoing relationship with the 
New York Hall of Science, Theatre Development Fund, Materials for the Arts, Make the Road New York, College Now, 
Magicbox productions, Beam Center, L.O.V.E Mentoring program, CUNY Creative Arts Team (CAT), Strike Anywhere 
Ensemble, and Duke of Edinburgh Opportunity. We are a PROSE school and have also been accepted into the Learning 
Partners program for a second year. We practice Mastery based learning and Restorative Justice and are connected to 
Mastery Collaborative. Teachers are supported by our literacy coach through the NYC Writing Project as well as a 
coach from INPS.  

Our school now enrolls about 300 students, all of whom are newly arrived immigrants and who represent over 30 
nationalities, with over 20 languages spoken in the home. In addition to our extensive scaffolding and differentiation 
in all classes, our school offers before school, after school and Saturday programming to support struggling learners 
and to provide enrichment activities for students seeking further challenges.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

As a school serving newcomer students, we have a higher than average percentage of Students with Limited/ 
Interrupted Formal Education (SLIFE). These are students who may not be literate in their native language due to a 
lack of opportunity for schooling in their home countries. These students require additional time with teachers, 
different types of scaffolds (i.e. learning the alphabet or basic numeracy) and additional help. We provide in class 
support, as well as a pull out class for this population. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Framework for Great School Components where we have made the most progress include: 

Supportive Environment: 

Our most recent (2016-2017) Quality Review cites school culture as an area for Celebration with a Well Developed 
rating. Our 2018 Learning Environment Survey supports this finding. For example, in the section on Supportive 
Environment our school scored +13% above the Borough average and +14% above the city average on classroom 
behavior. 97% of our students report that they "feel safe in their classes" The Principal Performance Observation visit 
from Spring 2018 cites Learning Environment as a strength, "Principal leads the school in the implementation of 
comprehensive strategies that promote a safe climate and the personal and academic growth of students. School is 
welcoming, safe and supportive. School continues to have supportive reading program, Restorative Justice practices 
in advisory and internship as part of CTE." Strong areas of practice include:  

 

  Weekly Guidance meetings with every teacher team to track and support students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

  Advisory for all students for goal setting and communication, allowing teachers to track a small group of 

students 
Implementation of Restorative Justice practices  

 
  Collaborative work between teachers mirrors expectations for students.   

In the coming school year, the school will build upon this work with the participation by staff members in summer 
training on restorative practices, as well as participation in Learning Partners around Restorative practices in order to 
continue to create a supportive environment, and to align with the Citywide Behavioral Expectations.  

 

Collaborative Teachers and Effective Leadership 

Quality Indicators from the most recent (2016-17) Quality Review offered evidence to support a Proficient rating for 
this component, on the basis of the school's existing committee structure, strategic decision making, goal setting and 
team inquiry work. The most recent PPO (Spring 2018) supports this finding: "Principal takes into account feedback 
and data to conduct a yearly cycle of evaluation and adjustment based on student needs and works with the 
Coordinating Council to refine and implement those plans during the year. Team and department meeting time is 
dedicated to addressing those goals. Principal is continuing to build the features of the school that support and 
extend the CTE program." Our 2017 School Performance Dashboard shows that in the categories of Trust and 
Effective Leadership our scores are in the "Exceeding" range. We seek to maintain successful practices in this 
component, and build upon them. We will continue with our restructured Coordinating Council and add one new 
committee (a CTE working group). The work of all committees will further be supported with the provision of 
additional meeting sessions for Discipline teams, and clear expectations for the roles, norms and reporting 
requirements for each working group. This year we piloted the use of the text Meeting Wise (by Boudett and City) to 
support grade team liaisons with concrete facilitation and agenda planning skills. Next year we will expand this work 
to include an overview for the full staff and follow up meetings with Discipline and Committee Leaders in order to 
build teacher leadership capacity and have even more efficient meetings. 

 

Strong Family and Community Ties 

IHS-HS has cultivated a strong set of community-based partners supporting the academic, social and emotional 
development of our staff and students. We are meeting expectations in the category of Strong Family-Community 
Ties on our Framework scores. In 2018-19, we seek to continue our progress in this component through the 
implementation of our fourth year of 11th grade internships, which will place students in work-based learning sites in 
the second semester of the school year. We will build on our successful family events by working to bring in a fully 
representative set of parents. 

 

Our key area for focus this year is: 

Rigorous Instruction  

In the most recent PPO feedback (Spring 2018) Curriculum and Pedagogy are listed as areas for improvement, "As 
you review the vertical curriculum, focus on the fact that curriculum must build towards the Portfolio Based 
Assessment Tasks (PBATs). Students should engage in curriculum that offers them choice, independence, and is 
differentiated."  

We will continue to develop strong Graduation Worthy Projects (GWP's) by supporting teachers to give each other 
feedback and present their work in instructional teams, with coaches facilitating. We will continue to revise our

instructional Outcomes and develop our Mastery based assessment practices as we did in 2017-2018. We have 
selected literacy across the curriculum as the focus for our PD committee in 2018-19. Our NYC Writing Project coach 
will facilitate the planning of a PD series to support literacy in all classrooms as well as strategies for our Reading 
classes. We have created a schedule for next year that allows for additional Team meetings in the spring to carve out 
more time for team inquiry work to be completed and presented during the PROSE structured review process in June 
2019. By supporting reading classes, improving our Mastery work and developing our Restorative Justice work for all 
students we will continue to build a strong foundation for academic accomplishment that leads to increased student 
achievement as measured by credit accumulation, completion of GWP projects for graduation, scholarship reports 
and Regents pass rates in ELA and Math.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
1. Our strengths in the area of Rigorous Instruction include: 

 

  According to our 2014-2015 School Quality Snapshot, 84% of students earned enough credits in 10th grade to 

be on track for graduation. Bear in mind that the graduation rate for ELL's in conventional school settings is 
34%. 

  Our 2016-2017 Learning Environment survey shows 97% percent of our students responding positively to 

questions about rigorous instruction (compared to 85% city wide). 

  Pass rates on ELA Regents in June 2016 were encouraging, 74% of 11th graders passed. 
  Our first year graduation rate, 2017, was 64%, compared to a graduation rate across the city for ELL's of 31%. 
  100% of our 12th graders (class of 2017) applied to college and 94% were accepted at one or more schools, 

these stats were similar for class of 2018. 

Best practices include: 

 

 

 

Implementation of Graduation Worthy, Common Core Aligned projects and benchmark projects school wide, 
with presentations each January and June. 
Implementation of 9th and 10th grade projects that scaffold up to Graduation projects by planning backwards 
from the Internationals for Public Schools, state approved rubrics. 
Internships completed by over 90% of our junior class in 2016-2017 at a variety of sites, but primarily those 
related to our Health Careers CTE focus. 

This data suggests that the Internationals approach of teaching language through content in mixed ability groups, 
with an emphasis on collaborative, hands-on group work is working effectively. 

 

2.Our priority needs include: 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

In our 2016-2017 Quality Review, a Proficient rating was given for 1.1, (Rigorous Curriculum) and 2.2 (Assessment). 
Our 2018 PPO reports included Pedagogy and Curriculum as areas for improvement: "Students should engage in 
curriculum that offers the choice, independence and is differentiated." and "Work with teachers to embed lessons in 
projects: skills need to be taught in the context of a larger idea. Use inter-visitations to other classrooms and schools 
to model the idea of more student voice and choice in project design."  

 

In order to support our goal of having students complete rigorous, Common Core aligned projects, our instructional 
needs/plans for this year include: 

 

 

 

Introduce technology and train staff to assess reading levels and provide remediation (Reading Plus and 
DORA) in an ongoing way. 

  Continue school wide reading initiative by providing additional training around conferencing in reading classes 

and continue inquiry work to assess efficacy of reading classes. We have made literacy the focus of our PD 
Committee, which will be led by our Writing Project coach. 

  Continue to develop high quality GWP projects by having an INPS coach facilitate feedback sessions for each 

GWP project using the "Guide for Self-Assessing a Common Core-Aligned Instructional Performance Task" 
which is based on the work of Hess and her cognitive rigor matrix.  

  Participation in moderation work with the Internationals Network for Public Schools to ensure consistency in 

assessment of graduation projects. 

  Continue to implement benchmark projects in our Junior Institute (9th/10th grade) to prepare students for 

assessments in Senior Institute (11th and 12th grade) 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 90% of our active 11th and 12th grade students will present rigorous, Common Core aligned projects 
designed to satisfy the requirements of the NY State ELL waiver-approved rubric.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers of the 5 core subjects (Math, Science, ELA, Social 
Studies, and Health careers) will have developed and 
implemented common-core aligned units ending in a 
performance task designed to satisfy the requirements of a 
portfolio presentation rubric. Steps towards implementing this 
goal include:  

Principal sets expectation that teachers plan content area 
outcomes (objectives) and interim and final assessments 
(projects, tasks, & exams) rated using rubrics for each of their 
units (September PD). 

Continue work of portfolio committee to guide the development 
of project tasks, and implement the presentation of midyear and 
end of year portfolios 

Designate a member of the IHS-HS staff to serve as a member of 
the INPS Portfolio Committee to coordinate local efforts with 
network initiatives 

An orientation in September conducted to explain outcomes-
based assessment and to provide training for families to monitor 
the marks for their students. This information also will be 
communicated during the registration of over-the-counter 
students after the start of the year, as well as at PTA and Open 
school sessions. 

Outside evaluators will be invited to observe portfolio 
presentations in January and June. 

Having identified a shared unit template (ATLAS), provide time 
and support for all teachers to update and populate all units.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
In October we will have a back-to-school night for parents that will kick off our monthly PTA meetings. Our parent 
coordinator organizes these meetings and teachers support her by presenting curriculum and other information to 
parents. Our Parent Coordinator and Community Associate both provide training to parents in usage of our school 
wide grading system, which parents can log onto. Our entire office staff is bi-lingual so they are able to provide 
translation and support to parents who arrive at school, attend meetings or are called by us. Our monthly PTA 
meetings will focus on a variety of issues of interest to families, but will definitely include support for understanding 
Common Core standards and project based learning.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

Our most recent Quality Review, completed in 2017/18 cites school culture as an area for celebration. Our survey 
data shows that our overall Framework Element score in Supportive Environment improved slightly between 2017 to 
2018 (going from 3.22 to 3.56). Our survey scores for Supportive Environment for school year 2017-18 are 13% better 
than our Borough average and 14% better than the City Average. Strong areas of practice include: 

 

 

  Weekly Guidance meetings with every teacher team to track and support students

Two of our Junior Institute teachers (Anya Wislocki and Priscilla 
Thomas) who are already trained in Restorative Justice, will work 
with a coach from The Morningside Center for Teaching Social 
Responsibility to train a group of 20-30 students over the course 
of ten weeks. The coach visit every other week (5 times total) 
with time in between for the teachers to practice and plan with 
students. Our Junior Institute students will focus on planning and 
leading advisory circles and our Senior Institute students (11th 
and 12th grade) will focus on Restorative Conferences with the 
support of our Guidance Counselor, Randy Pena, who has both 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 Restorative Justice training. We will also be able 
to work with one of our sister schools, Prospect Heights 
International, which has been piloting training youth leaders this 
year. Our work with students will take place during lunch and 
after school and we plan to select students based on interest and 
teacher nominations. We are seeking to include both our top 
citizens and also those students who show leadership potential, 
but do not always direct it positively. We know that purchasing 
special shirts for our Circle Keepers (that they will help design) 
will create some momentum and group spirit for this project. Our 
entire population are English Language Learners, so as with all

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. Our school's strengths in the area of Collaborative Teachers include: 

  Our survey results from 2018 include: "96% of teachers say that tat their school the principal, teachers and 
staff collaborate to make the school run effectively." and also from 2018 Survey results: " 100% of teachers 
say that their professional development experiences this year have been sustained and coherent." 

  On our most recent 2017-18 Quality Review we were found proficient in the area of teacher teams and 

leadership development, with the reviewer commenting that, "The work of teacher teams results in 
strengthening pedagogical approaches steering improved student progress." 

Best practice includes: 

  Our practice of weekly instructional team meetings, teacher planned PD sessions, inquiry cycles supported by 

team liaisons and coaches. 

  Our use of the book Meeting Wise to teach facilitation and agenda planning skills during monthly meetings 

with teacher leaders. 

2. Our priority needs in this area include: 

  Providing further training for teachers on the use of mastery based grading and Jumprope grading system, 

which allows for a focus on mastery over completion. Teachers can target skills that have not been mastered 
give targeted feedback to students. 

  Continue to revise and improve existing Outcomes and monitoring of student progress. Creation of a vertical 

alignment documents created in Discipline meetings during school year 2017-18. 

  Develop our new 12th grade Advisory program to support students in academic goal setting and monitoring.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Areas of strength/best practices for this element include: 

 

 

  Our school successfully implemented the third year of internships. Over 90% of juniors completed a semester 

long internship and presented their work at our Spring internship fair. Partner organizations and some 
parents were able to attend to help evaluate and celebrate student work.  
In January 2016 our school hired a Parent Coordinator who has been able to increase participation at SLT, 
PTA, Back to School and Parent-Teacher Conference events. 

 

  Our addition of a second Guidance Counselor in September 2016, as well as a Family Worker in October 2016 

 

increases our ability to support families. We anticipate hiring a school aide for school year 2018-19. 
In our most recent School Quality Report (2016-2017) our survey data was cited as being positive overall on 
the topic of Strong Family-Community Ties. For example, "98% of families say that the principal encourages 
feedback from the community and them through regular meetings." and "96% of families say that the 
principal at their school promotes family and community involvement in the school." 

  This year we continued an established partnerships with the National Academy Foundation (NAF), Theatre 

Development Fund (TDF), Internationals Network for Public Schools, New York Hall of Science and our many 
internship cites. Next year we will continue with additional partnerships formed in the past year with Beam 
Center, Magic Box Productions, the Telluride Film Festival.  

Our priority needs in this area include: 

 

Increasing the number of internship sites related to health careers by reaching out to neighborhood 
institutions as well as continuing a medical assisting class and CPR training, which will increase student 
awareness and interest in medical internships. 
Increasing our attendance at events planned for families and attracting more diverse language groups. 

 
  Applying for grants to support an increase in partnerships.  
 

Increasing the percentage of parents who volunteer at the school.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
IHS-HS recruits highly qualified teaching candidates through both the NYCDOE Open Market and New Teacher Finder 
systems and via the Internationals Network of Public Schools, a non-profit organization that oversees and coordinates 
activities amongst the NYCDOE’s 15 International High Schools. Through our membership in this network, we have 
access to resumes of the school system’s most highly qualified pedagogues with vast experience working with ELLs, 
who solely comprise all of the International High Schools’ student populations. Additionally, the professionally 
engaged network of teachers serving in our school has served to communicate our staffing needs to the teaching 
community, attracting a number of well-qualified candidates to apply for positions within our school. 

 

To date, as we begin our fifth year, two teachers have left our school, one to teach overseas and another is moving 
out of state. Teachers are assigned to programs based on their licenses and stated preferences. Currently, we have no 
teachers in core courses teaching out of their licensed areas. Retention of qualified staff attracted to work in the 
school is fostered by creating a supportive professional environment that focuses on staff development, creates 
distributed leadership opportunities and provision of supports needed by teachers to accomplish their instructional 
and professional goals. Teachers are provided with opportunities to collaborate in instructional teams serving a 
shared population of students, discipline teams, and professional committees to address areas of shared staff focus, 
such as portfolio, internship and student support. See additional details in Part 2B. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
IHS-HS offers its pedagogues many opportunities for teacher leadership and high quality professional development. 
Because IHS-HS is a new school where collaborative practices are highly valued, teachers have great decision-making 
power in establishing, maintaining and altering school-wide policies. Teachers also learn facilitation skills through 
leading their weekly interdisciplinary teaching team, which occurs on a rotating basis.  

Professional growth of all pedagogues is fostered on several levels including biweekly professional development 
sessions (whole faculty) and interdisciplinary teaching team meetings, and guidance meetings each of which occur 
weekly. The biweekly professional development sessions allow faculty the opportunity to collaboratively: establish 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

whole school policies, share best instructional practices, discuss progress towards school-wide instructional goals, 
develop and refine the restorative justice program, and discuss advisory class issues. During weekly team and 
guidance meetings, faculty meet with the school guidance counselor in order to discuss case management of their 
shared student population (Tuesdays and Thursdays) as well as to engage in interdisciplinary project planning and 
analysis of student work (Mondays). Because each interdisciplinary teaching team contains at least one ESL-certified 
teacher, all faculty members, regardless of subject area certification, learn about ESL strategies to further enhance 
instruction across disciplines. All teachers also receive specialized training in ESL strategies and working with ELLs 
through network-wide professional development with the Internationals Network for Public Schools (INPS). INPS 
provides workshops during the summer, on Election Day, and at various times throughout the school year via after-
school seminars and teacher intervisitations (peer observations at various IHSs). Coaches from partner organizations, 
specifically the Internationals Network for Public Schools, the NYC Writing Project, and the National Academy 
Foundation provide focused support for high-leverage components of teacher practice. Finally, a peer-observation 
model, supported in 2016-17 with funding from the PROSE system, provides a source of feedback outside the 
channels of administrative rating , which supports teacher practice and continues to reinforce our school’s identity as 
a place where both students and adults may learn and grow together.

The MOSL Committee, made up of the entire staff, analyzes and discusses appropriate assessment measures for the 
entire school. In addition, they surveyed the teachers in order to receive feedback about the correct assessments to 
choose. Subject area teams meet a minimum of once weekly to discuss curriculum and assessment. Teams work 
together with the support of administration to choose common assessments to help track student progress. In 
addition, we have used a standards-based assessment system since 2013, that calls for multiple forms of assessment. 
Teacher teams analyze data from this system to make changes to instruction and better serve student needs. 
Students are given multiple opportunities to achieve learning goals through a variety of assessments. Over the past 
year, the PD committee, made up of teachers, has worked to create staff-wide PD to support teachers in this work. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The International High School for Health Sciences, in compliance with the 
Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a 
parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the 
School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed 
members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The International High School for Health Sciences will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional

   The International High School for Health Sciences will implement a content-based ESL 
program for our heterogenous population of ELL students. Teams of teachers (five per team) will 
design and implement standards-based, interdisciplinary, project-based curricula for their 
students. All classes will be taught in English, following the Internationals Network model of 
content and language integration. Teachers in all content areas will be trained to incoporate ESL 
methodologies and strategies for language acquisition and development. All ESL teachers are 
fully licensed and content teachers receive more that 10 hours of ESL training annually.  
Through the direct instruction supplemental program, ELL students will have the opportunity to 
enhance their English through participation in language-rich extra-curricular programs designed 
to meet their unique linguistic needs, while allowing students to explore their interests and 
talents. The direct instruction supplemental program will begin the first week in October 2018 
and will end on June 2019. Program offerings will include Academic Enrichment in Science and 
Social Studies Through ESL, Literacy Circle, and a Biliteracy Program for native speakers of 
French. All programs will place particular emphasis on the development of ELLs' speaking skills 
and in targeted skill development in literacy and numeracy. These programs will be held before 
and after school to maximize opportunities for student participation. The supplemental 
instructional program will serve ELLs in 9-10th grade who score at the beginner and 
intermediate levels of the NYSESLAT. Subgroups of students to be served include our SIFE 
population, native speakers of French and ELLs with special needs at all grade levels. All 
supplemental programs will be taught in English by ESL-certified teachers or are co-taught by 
content and ESL-certified instructors. Four teachers participate in the direct instructional 
supplemental program.  These teachers are embedded with instructional teams with whom they 
co-plan and implement a freestanding ESL program.  In addition to the periods in which they 
directly teach ELA, ESL and Reading sections, they will co plan with history, math and science 
teachers the delivery of content using strategies to support new speakers of English. 
Literacy Circle: An ESL-certified teacher will plan and teach this program that focuses on 
targeted literacy development for 9th and 10th grade beginner level ELL students as well as 
SLIFE. The class will provide supplemental small group instruction for 12 ELL students. It 
meets Wednesdays and Fridays from 3:00 - 4:00p.m. for a total of 60 sessions. The language of 
instruction is English. Materials include teacher-created materials as well as low lexile English 
language readings This year we will also be incorporating a Bridge curriculum for 
SLIFE students. 
 
Also beginning in October and operating until June, the school will offer a reading program as a 
component of a school-wide initiative for the 2018-19 school year.  Professional development 
will be offered to all staff teaching the classes.  English teachers will serve as key facilitators on 
their respective instructional teams, fulfilling the role of matching students to texts, and 
supporting other teachers as they facilitate reading courses.  The school will expand access to 
leveled classroom libraries, provide access to online literacy support software, including DORA 
and Reading Plus,and enlist coaching support from the NYC Writing Project and Internationals 
Network for Public Schools to develop staff capacity in this work.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Academic Enrichment in Science and Social Studies: All ELLs are invited to participate in the 
Academic Supplemental program. 50 ELL students/week will participate, from grades 9-12.  The 
Academic Enrichment classes will be co-taught by a Science-certified teacher, a Social Studies 
certified-teacher and ESL-certified teachers. The program will offer ELLs the opportunity to 
receive additional instruction to ensure that these students have increased interaction with course 
material to deepen their learning. The program is available on Monday through Friday from 7:40 
- 8:40a.m. for a total of 80 hourlong sessions. The language of instruction is in English. 
Materials: leveled informational trade books, DORA and Reading Plus online programs, teacher-
made materials, and other Internet resources. 
 
Period attendance is maintained by classroom teachers using the Jumprope system.  Period 
attendance is visible to all teachers serving a student, and staff are directed to look for patterns of 
absences, latenesses and potential cutting.  Late arriving students must route via the main office, 
where a late pass is issued, and the tardiness is recorded on the ATS attendance sheet.  Daily 
attendance folders for ATS are distributed fifth period by a Family Worker, and teachers on duty 
record attendance.  The folder is collected at the end of the period, and is scanned to ATS by the 
Parent Coordinator.  The Parent Coordinator further supports teachers using Jumprope and 
ATS by communicating excuse notes delivered to the school.  These are memorialized in 
Jumprope, before CIND is used to update attendance in ATS.  Daily autodialer calls are placed 
using school messenger, which is programmed to call in the home language of the family on file 
on the HLIS on file in each student's cumulative folder, collected upon intake.

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
IHS-HS’s enrollment criteria require that all admitted students are recently immigrated English 
language learners who are at the beginning of their development of English language 
learning.  As a result, each classroom is populated by new students of English eligible for Title 
III support, and requiring the support of well-trained teachers to address their leaning needs. 
All teachers work with ELLs in our school, so all 21 teachers will participate in our professional 
development program. 
Professional development is ongoing, beginning in late August of 2018 and running until the end 
of June 2019. 
The primary PD days will be Mondays, which will alternate between committees focusing of 
training, portfolio-based instruction and social/emotional support working groups.  These will 
alternate with whole staff PD that will include committee-developed resources, with support 
from our partners including INPS and NYCWP.  Periodically, we will provide additional, 
targeted training sessions on select topics, such as the use of online tools, such as Jumprope and 
Reading Plus.  Other PD opportunities will include Chancellor’s PD days, as well as inter-
visitation opportunities that recur on a monthly basis from October to June. 
There are two school-wide instructional foci to which our school’s professional development 
planning is primarily aligned with.  
The first is the development of curriculum resources.  Now in our sixth year, we are refining 
learning objectives, lesson and unit plans that align to our school’s instructional design 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53

principles, while mapping a clear progression from recently arrived to graduation-worthy 
portfolio presentations. 
The second instructional focus is on implementing a school wide reading program.  The initiative 
provides opportunities for all students to have dedicated reading instruction, differentiated to 
meet their individual needs.  Training includes increasing teacher capacity to support readers, use 
of online reading tools and matching students to appropriate leveled texts. 
IHS-HS works with several providers including: 
The Internationals Network for Public Schools (INPS) – Provides curriculum resources, 
individual and group coaching, organizes workshops and inter-visitations to address a range of 
topics relevant to the delivery of high-quality instruction to ELLs using research-tested methods. 
The New York City Writing Project (NYCWP) – Supplements the coaching support offered by 
the INPS with a particular focus on the acquisition of reading and writing skills. Elements 
include individual and group coaching delivered by a NYCWP coach, consultation in the 
development of professional development to support the school-wide reading initiative launched 
this school year, and support of inter-visitation between classrooms and schools to observe and 
learn from strong practitioners working with ELLs. 
  

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

Begin description here:            
                     Our Guidance Counselor is responsive to the needs of our parents, who are all 
parents of ELLs .  Working with the Principal and our Parent Coordinator, he conducts  a needs 
assessment to determine which CBOs to invite and which topics to cover at parent 
meetings  pertaining to ELLs . Translators are made available during the meetings. 
 Parent meetings  are specifically designated for ELL parents, as all students in the school are 
ELLs. The PA meetings occur once a month on the first Tuesday of the month.  The meetings 
will be scheduled from 5-7:30pm and will be facilitated by the  Guidance Counselors (Randy

IHS-HS has a staff with wide language capacities represented.  For families who do not have a 
school employee who can translate, live interpreters will be made available for mass in-person 
events, including Open School, Parent-Teacher conference and PTA meeting nights.  For 
individual sessions without staff translation available, over-the-phone services will be 
utilized.  All staff members have been trained on using this system, and a memo was issued in 
October 2018 directing its use.  As a school serving an ELL population exclusively, these 
supports are a part of how our school operates.  All of our parents are likely family members of 
students receiving Title III support.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
For all our newcomers we use a series of assessments to determine the English level of the students we are serving.  The ELA 
Performance task was administered to all students to determine their levels of English proficiency, which was determined to 
offer significant room for student growth.  We also administer the NYSITELL and Spanish Lab tests to further document each 
students' language abilities.  We use a SLIFE screener provided by the NYC DOE for incoming students identified through the 
intake process. We use a MLS screener for literacy in Native Language that was suggested by the New York State Bridges 
program. Our ELA/ESL teachers in the 9th and 10th grade uses DORA 3 times a year to track literacy progress.  This information 
is shared with the instructional team in order to inform curriculum planning. These assessments are complemented by the 
lengthy interview and intake process, as well as teacher assessments.   
The results of the various assessments offer a breakdown of specific areas of strengths and weaknesses, and allow a 
disaggregation of students into targeted groups so we can gear our instruction toward helping the student in areas of 
academic need and tailor extra help specifically geared to those students.  The information collected by these means is used to

Support on a pull-out basis, using the Bridges curriculum. Additional support will be offered via outside-of-school offerings, 
including before and after day and weekend programming.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 A SLIFE Committee meets every other week to discuss strategies for supporting low native literacy students, as well as 
enriching supports of Academic Language instruction, such as vocabulary and peer tutoring groups.  Each strategy is designed 
to support the development of English literacy and fluency among all of our students at whatever level of their language 
development.  These strategies are piloted and then shared with the rest of the staff. 
In addition we have the pull out SLIFE class.  Our main structure is the ongoing PD through the Internationals for Public Schools 
Network so that all teachers are continuously learning the Instructional model that has been proven successful for ELL 
students. 
In addition our school is structured into teacher teams, which meet twice weekly.  One of those meetings is a Guidance 
meeting devoted to tracking student socio-emotional and academic growth and coordinating services and supports with the 
guidance counselor. 
This year we have also formed a partnership with the CUNY Arts Team (CAT) to participate in a program which funds a 
teaching artist and advocate counselor who especially targets 30 low-achieving (as defined by grades) students. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Near term results indicating the success of our efforts will include attendance, participation in intervention activities, student 
progress on learning objectives, credit accumulation, growth on the Performance Assessment and progress in their interim 
portfolio score. 
 Ultimate measures of our school's  success of our program additionally consider other data sources, including: 
  
•    Learning Environment Survey-student results 
•     Learning Environment Survey -parent results 
•     Learning Environment Survey-teacher results 
•     Drop out rate 
•     College class passing rate 
•     Portfolio passing rate 
•     Graduation rate 
•     Course pass rate 
•     Regents pass rate 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Our teachers are structured into teams, with a weekly Guidance meeting to discuss student progress and support 
strategies.  Our committee and team leaders meet weekly with administrators to share concerns and make plans.  For an 
intervention, we consider: Teacher recommendation, parent request, NYSESLAT data, teacher created assessment data and 
native language literacy. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A Serving 9-12   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The performance of our students on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT indicates: 
a)  Our population is heterogeneous in terms of language ability. 
b)  Most students are classified as entering and emerging. 
c)  Advanced students are more likely to have been in a US middle school and longer in the US than recent arrivals. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

d)  The second cohort of students includes a larger proportion of learners who attended middle school than the founding 
cohort 
 Review of our NYSITELL / NYSELSAT data shows that it requires until the third administration of the NYSESLAT to show 
significant growth.  The first and second administrations of NYSESLAT, when compared to the baseline of the NYSITELL show 
modest growth.  Our data from successful completion of our Performance Based graduation assessments shows that for 
students who get to 12th grade over 90% of them are able to achieve at least a competent/pass. 
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

All of our teachers are ELL teachers, but we have one dedicated ESL teacher who coordinates state assessments, conducts the 
Bridges pull-out class and heads up our SLIFE Committee.  She works with all teachers to provide information and strategies for 
supporting students.  In addition to our pull out class, we provide before school and after school homework help and tutoring 
at all grade levels, including a peer tutoring program coordinated by a teacher.  This year we are adding a partnership with a. 
mentoring program that specifically targets Latina girls for academic support on the road to college.  This decision was made 
based on academic data for this population. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

.  Instruction: 
   a. Instruction at our school is delivered collaboratively by teams of four to six teachers who work to plan instruction 
for groups of approximately 75 students.   
   b. Our school uses all of these program models.  Each group of students is block programmed and those students 
travel together throughout the day.  Within their blocks, 9th and 10th grade students are mixed, while 11th grade 
students meet as a single grade cohort.  The blocks are heterogeneous, but at various times teachers may choose to 
group students within the block homogeneously if that suits the students’ and block’s needs for a specific project. 
c.  Integrated and Standalone ENL are implemented:  Entering/Emerging students will receive a minimum of 540 
minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of ENL standalone, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and 180 
minutes of standalone or integrated ENL (with ELA or any other content area).  Emerging/Transitioning will receive 
360 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 90 minutes of standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and 
90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area.  Transitioning will receive 180 ENL 
minutes per week which consists of 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area and 90 minutes of 
standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area). Expanding will receive 180 minutes of ENL per 
week which consists of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.  Commanding or students who are 
former ELL's will receive 90 minutes of ENL each week which consists of 90 integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

          
As per the new CR Part 154 requirements, beginning September 2015, students will be carefully programmed to receive the 
mandated ENL and ELA instructional minutes based on new proficiency guidelines.  Entering students will receive a minimum 
of 540 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of ENL standalone, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and 180 
minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area).  Emerging will receive 360 minutes of ENL per 
week (this consists of 90 minutes of standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA  and 90 minutes of standalone or 
integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area.)  Transitioning will receive 180 ENL minutes per week (this consists of 90 
minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other 
content area). Commanding will receive 180 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or 
other content area.)  Commanding or students who are former ELL's will receive 90 minutes of ENL each week (this consists of 
90 integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.)  
  
Each instructional team's students are taught by dual certified ESL/English content area teachers.  Each instructional team 
includes at least one teacher who is licensed in ESL; in addition, all of our content area teachers are trained in language 
development and ESL methodologies and encouraged to pursue ESL certification.  The school schedule and teacher 
programming ensure that all entitled ESL students receive the mandated number of minutes required according to CR Part 
154.  In addition to our regular content curriculum all ELL students are given extra ESL instruction in order to meet the number 
of minutes they require of ESL instruction each week. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   All students take math, science, social studies, and ESL and/or English every year.  Although the language that teachers use 
from the front of the room is English, the language of instruction for specific projects and on any specific day is collaboratively 
determined – students use both English and their native languages to explore content and the locus of control for language is 
student-driven by the content and the students’ needs.  Instruction is not unidirectional from teacher to student in our 
school.  Students work in groups to complete collaborative tasks that both develop language and content knowledge.  The 
instructional method used in delivering content area instruction is through the Internationals Network for Public Schools 
(INPS) Approach.  This research based instructional approach utilizes five strategies which foster language development and 
meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.  They consist of heterogeneity and collaboration, experiential and 
project based learning, language and content integration, localized autonomy and responsibility and one learning model for 
all.  A variety of instructional materials are used such as: laptops, library books, work books, dictionaries and teacher 
generated activities.  The educational principles of The Internationals HS for Health Sciences include an approach to curriculum 
that is student centered, inquiry driven and project based revolving around themes and essential questions that provide a 
balance between content and English language skill building.  Small heterogeneous grouping within classes provides a 
powerful vehicle for English acquisition, wherein students from diverse language backgrounds use English to accomplish a 
given task, drawing on their native language as a resource.  Language and literacy are developed through interaction with 
peers and teachers about meaningful ideas in authentic context.  In order to provide our students with native language 
support in the content area we provide our students with bilingual dictionaries, peer group support, native language texts as 
well as bilingual staff to assist in the classroom. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   At the International High School for Health Sciences ELL’s are appropriately evaluated using the instructional strategies as 
described in Question # 6 (a-e) below.  At Orientation incoming ELL’s are given a native language assessment.  At the 
International HS we greatly value student’s native languages.  All of our interdisciplinary classes have native language 
components to them.  In addition as one of the requirements for graduation students complete a Native Language project 
which they present to a panel. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61

Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a)     Instructional plan for SLIFE Students: 
All students who are identified as SLIFE students (Students with Limited or Interrupted Formal Education) are immediately 
placed in our SLIFE program where they receive additional support in English literacy until a level of proficiency is achieved as 
determined by the SLIFE coordinator and the SLIFE Leadership team along with the student’s individual teachers and guidance 
counselors.  The common denominator among these students is a weakness or inability to read or write in their native 
language.  Teachers and guidance counselors identify students who meet this profile through an examination of report cards, 
educational history and student work, student parent interviews and teachers referrals, as well as an MLS screener in their 
native language when possible.  Once students are identified to enter the SLIFE program, our challenge is to find ways to teach 
students to read and write in English and acquire content knowledge when they have limited, if any, literacy skills in any 
language and may also have serious affective issues as well.   
In order to service students who are struggling, each team has provided extra services:  including one-on-one work with a 
teacher, small group instruction, and after school tutoring.  School-wide, a Saturday enrichment program has been 
established, and changes in student programs (such as an extra language arts period) have been made.  Over the past four 
years with the money’s from fair student funding an accelerated literacy program was implemented school-wide and met with 
enthusiasm by staff, students and parents. 
Our SLIFE model requires three important features: 
•     An intensive Language Arts period is held during the regular core daily program to accelerate learning taught by a specially 
trained literacy ESL licensed teacher in small group settings of five to ten students in which instruction is guided by individual 
students’ needs.  This class is focused on reading comprehension, reading fluency and vocabulary development based on high 
interest topics drawn from the social studies curriculum. 
•     Scaffolding students’ work in regular heterogeneous classes for most of the school day by developing collaboration 
between the SLIFE teacher and content area teachers to generalize and practice newly learned skills and strategies across a 
variety of settings.  A team teaching approach would be used in which the SLIFE teacher plans with the content areas teacher, 
works with SLIFE students in the classroom daily to implement strategies, and also meets after class sessions with the content 
area teacher to discuss students’ work and review lessons and activities. 
•     All SLIFE students are expected to attend extra before school home work sessions. 
•     Our Instructional team has obtained a SLIFE toolkit developed by the staff of a neighboring Internationals network school.   
  
b)     Plan for ELLs who have been in US schools less than three years (Newcomers): 
Newcomers to the school, along with their parents, meet initially with a guidance counselor who assesses their needs and 
academic development during intake.  All new students and their parents receive an orientation developed by the guidance 
staff along with the parent coordinator.  All students new to the United States and to NYC are given the Lab R exam which 
assesses the students English language abilities.  For students transferring in from NYC schools test results are reviewed and 
students are then matched with teams of teachers who it is felt would best meet the needs of the specific student.  Students 
are placed in appropriate classes according to their specific needs.  The teachers meet in team to discuss the specific needs of 
all new students.  A plan is formulated to best meet the needs of each particular student. 
  
c)     Plan for ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years (Developing): 
The plan for ELLs receiving  service for 4-6 years consists of ongoing support and mentoring. ELLs with 4-6 years of service are 
placed in appropriate classes to best meet their needs and continuing English language development.  Their teachers meet 
regularly in teams to discuss the needs fo the specific students.  A plan is formulated and updated regularly to meet the needs 
of each student.  ELLs who are receiving service for 4-6 years receive a full program and receive all the same support structures 
as the rest of our ELL populations.  Struggling ELLs who are receiving 4-6 years of service are encouraged and often mandated 
to avail themselves of all the extra support opportunities provided to all the students at large.  This help takes the form of one-
on-one mentoring, small group instruction, after school homework help, the Saturday literacy program as well as a variety of 
other activities.  ELLs with 4-6 years of service are encouraged to try to take some college classes to help them to begin the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

transition towards college life.  These ELLs with 4-6 years who meet regularly with their guidance counselor and teachers on 
their team to receive support and feedback to help assess in their language development. 
  
d)     Plan for ELLs who have completed 6+ years (Long Term ELLs): 
The plan for long term ELLs consists of ongoing support and mentoring.  Long term ELLs continue with a full program whether 
they are with us 5 or 6 years and retain all of the same support structures in place for the entire student 
population.  Struggling long term ELLs are encouraged to take advantage of all extra help opportunities provided to the 
students at large.   This extra help takes the form of one-on-one mentoring, small group instruction, after school homework 
help, writing center as well as a variety of other activities.  Whenever possible long term ELLs are encouraged to begin taking 
college classes to help them to begin the transition towards college life.  International High School long term ELLs regularly 
begin taking remedial college classes.  All long term ELLs in college classes receive support from a high school teacher mentor. 
  
e)     Instructional Plan for Former ELL's up to 2 years after exiting ELL status): 
As students reach proficiency and test out through the NYSESLAT assessment, they continue to receive a full program of ESL 
services to support and provide for their continued academic growth and development of English proficiency.   Students 
receive higher levels of project opportunities and also have the opportunity to take college classes in any of their academic 
areas.  Our school offers these students the opportunity to receive an Associates Degree from LaGuardia Community College 
along with their high school diploma as part of a five year program.  Students who are determined to have reached proficiency 
continue to receive support from their teachers as needed.  Former ELLs continue to receive the mandated testing 
accommodations after they they have tested out on the NYSESLAT exam. All former ELLs in college classes receive support 
from a high school teacher mentor. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Instructional strategies and grade level materials used to provide ELL-SWD's access to academic areas and accelerate English 
language development: 
At present, the International HS for Health Sciences has eight students with a documented IEP.  The guidance counselor, 
Principal and Special Education liaison from the Affinity Group Field Support Team will review all IEP’s for ELL-SWD’s to ensure 
that all IEP mandates are being met and to ensure that the ELL-SWD student receives the appropriate program in the least 
restrictive environment.  After reviewing the mandates of the IEP, the full team of teachers meet with Virjand Depoo and 
Mohammad Hakima, our Special Education teachers to discuss specific instructional strategies that would prove valuable to 
the growth of the ELL-SWD student and follow the mandates of the IEP.  The team along with the guidance 
counselor,  Principal and Special Education teachers will ensure that all of the mandates in the IEP are carried out. If additional 
support is needed the student is provided with additional support services as per the IEP.   
The ELL-SWD students who may have learning needs undiagnosed in their home country, have been here a short time and are 
only beginning to learn English, and/or have experienced serious disruptions and inadequacies in their earlier academic 
preparation are addressed by creating instructional opportunities geared to their needs. Students with Individualized 
Education Plans (IEP's) receive full support from the instructional teams to which they belong. Those students are included in 
mainstream classes, and receive additional services in language, counseling, and adaptive physical education. In biweekly 
meetings, the teachers of our instructional teams meet to review the progress of these and other students. Teams of teachers 
along with the guidance counselors meet regularly throughout the semester to review the progress of each student in 
accordance with their specific IEP. 
Some of the specific instructional strategies for ELLs depending on the requirements of their specific IEP’s include:   In order to 
service the ELL-SWD student in the least restrictive environment students are mainstreamed into the regular academic class 
and each team provides extra services: including one-on-one work with a paraprofessional, small group instruction and after 
school tutoring.  School-wide, a Saturday enrichment program exists, and changes in student programs are made to allow the 
student time to meet with the necessary special service provider depending on the students specific needs.   
Other strategies include scaffolding students’ work in the regular heterogeneous classes for most of the school day by 
developing collaboration between the Special Education teacher or service provider and the content area teachers.  A team 
teaching approach would be used in which the Special Education teacher plans with the content area teachers to map out 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

strategies an best practices and to access the students strengths and area which still need improvement.  Our teachers are 
expert at scaffolding and differentiation due to our model, so this is helpful for students with IEP's, as material is regularly 
presented with visuals and other scaffolds for all students due to varying levels of English. 
If necessary, ELL-SWD students are expected to attend extra after school home work sessions and are also enrolled in our 
twice weekly SIFE support class. 
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The International HS for Health Sciences will use a variety of curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet the 
diverse needs of ELL-SWD’s to attain their IEP goals within the least restrictive environment.  Once students are identified ELL-
SWD’s our challenge is to find ways to teach students according to the mandates of their IEP’s in the least restrictive 
setting.  We do this by having our Special Education teacher push into ELA and Math classes, as well as plan with the Social 
Studies and Science teachers. The team meets with a Special Education teacher or service provider hired for this purpose 
depending on the needs of that students particular IEP in order to determine the best instructional strategies to meet the 
needs to that student according to their IEP.  In order to service students who are struggling, each team is organized provided 
extra services:  including one-on-one work with a teacher, small group instruction, and after school tutoring.  By adapting 
curriculum to enable those students to succeed, by expanding the time available to team members to work with them 
individually, and by using the resources of paraprofessionals, student teachers and interns, they are supported in meeting the 
graduation certification requirements.  Our plan maintains that our students with IEP’s will receive additional academic 
assistance in accordance with the particular needs of their individualized IEP’s.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All of our targeted intervention program are geared towards supporting all of our ELL subgroups; teachers running these 
programs implement the “Internationals Approach” in all of them: 
•     Silent Sustained Reading Class—All ELL students receive targeted intervention enrichment classes in literacy and which 
meet two times per week for 40 minutes throughout the year during the regular school day. Group size will be maintained at 
15-18 students per teacher.  This class will be targeted to Beginning, Intermediate and Advanced level students.  Certified ESL 
teachers along with content area teachers will provide supplemental instruction in alignment with the New York City and New 
York State content and performance standards.  Instruction will focus on developing skills in English Literacy work on students 
portfolio projects and oral presentations. 
•     SLIFE ESL Literacy class---specially addresses instruction in second language acquisition to improve literacy performance 
through new vocabulary learning, pronunciation, read-out loud, oral practice through conversation and discussion, and 
sentence structure.  One class each consisting of roughly 10 students will meet 2 times a week for 40 minutes each, from late 
September to early June.  This class will target Beginning level students to help them improve on the NYSESLAT.  Instructional 
material, general classroom supplies and snacks will be purchased to support this class. 
•     SLIFE Math Literacy class- specially addresses instruction in math literacy as well as and in second language acquisition to 
improve math literacy performance through classroom discussion of mathematical concepts and word problems, vocabulary 
learning, pronunciation and oral practice through conversation and discussion.  One class consisting of roughly 10 students will 
meet 2 times a week for 40 minutes each, from late September to early June.  This class will target Beginning level students to 
help them improve both on the Integrated Algebra Regents as well as the NYSESLAT.  Instructional material, general classroom 
supplies will be purchased to support this class. 
  
•     Student Community Involvement—ELL students with opportunities to do community service, research projects, and 
leadership training.  This will culminate in their understanding of social issues that pertain to immigrant populations and thus 
enhance cultural awareness, social learning and a positive adjustment to American society.  This year, students already have 
participated in a planting project around the grounds of the school, and contributed analytic data to a collaborative effort that 
monitors the health of the Hudson River watershed.  As an element of our community engagement, we are seeking 
opportunities to partner with our local Community Board to launch a community gardening project to foster an awareness of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

the connection between environmental and human health. 
 Before/After School Tutoring-content area teachers in Social Studies, the students native language, English, Math and Science. 
Content area teachers in Social Studies, English, Math and Science provide support to students in all sub-groups in small group 
settings for one to two hours per week.  Although all students may avail themselves of Before/After School tutoring the main 
ELL sub-groups which are targeted are the SLIFE students, Newcomers and ELL-SWD students. This not only includes students 
who are having difficulties with their class work but also provides assistance for students who are working on their portfolio 
projects which include projects such as their Social Studies Research paper, Native language project, Math Project, Science 
project, English literary essay, Creative project as well as their Mastery Statement.  These classes are taught by licensed 
pedagogues in the content area.  Native language support is provided to students in all of the above mentioned intervention 
programs through the use of bilingual pedagogues, student peer and college mentors who share a common native 
language.  In addition, bilingual dictionaries and multi-lingual computer software are utilized as well. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on our data and trends from last year we have made some significant changes for the upcoming school year (2017-
2018).  Our SLIFE working group has become a full fledged Committee.  This means it incorporates a larger number of teachers 
and meets more regularly (moving from monthly to twice monthly meetings).  The Committee is staffed with a mix of expert 
teachers (like our ESL coordinator) and newer teachers who are seeking support.  The Committee will plan PD on 
SLIFE strategies (some of which will be helpful for Entering/Emerging students as well).   In addition, our ESL coordinator 
attended Bridges training and will be working in partnership with Fordham to pilot a pull out Bridges class for 
SLIFE students.  She will is doing diagnostic testing with all 9th graders to identify students for the pull out group, but also to 
inform the teaching of all of the ninth grade teachers.  We have introduced a new native language assessment (MLS) and will 
continue using DORA throughout the year to assess reading levels.  Last year one team of teachers did inquiry work on our 
Reading initiative (which was new) which they will continue this year.  They identified a mix of students with different native 
languages and a range of grades and made close observations of their improvement in reading levels (using DORA).  They 
noticed useful trends like the fact that some students who were relying on translation technology seemed not to progress as 
well in speaking.  This year they are exploring whether the increased emphasis on using vocabulary glossaries rather than 
translation technology will be useful. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We do not plan to make any cuts in our programs or services pending any change in the budget. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Since over 95% of our students are ELLs, all school programs are “equal access.” In addition to the support and intervention 
services listed in the answer to question five of this section, we have the following after-school classes; while they may not all 
be “academic” in theme, all of them are designed to continue students’ language development through activities incorporating 
listening, speaking, reading, and writing of English:  
Additionally, our students are eligible to participate in campus sports teams, where they have the opportunity to interact with 
a diverse cohort of team mates, many of whom are native English speakers, providing a natural context for the development of 
English speaking and listening skills in a natural context 
All ELLs are invited to participate in the above listed activities at the time that they register for classes each semester. At 
registration they meet with their guidance counselor and teachers on their instructional team who describe the different 
activities.  Students make a selection with the assistance of their teachers.  Since virtually all of our students are either ELLs the 
representation by ELLs in all of our school programs is substantial. 
 In addition, since we are working to establish an early college access program academically qualified students are entitled to 
take free college level classes through the College Now Program. 
 Funding sources for after school and supplemental services offered to ELL’s in our School: 
Our school supports its programs through a mix of Tax levy and Title I funds, supplemented this year by additional funding 
from ARRA/RTTT funds.  The SLIFE Literacy and SLIFE Math classes which are held during the regular school day are currently 
funded exclusively with tax levy funds.  The funding for the Enrichment class is also covered by regular tax levy funding since it 
takes place during the regular school day.

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
It is the philosophy of the school that classroom teachers are the most knowledgeable as to what instructional supplies will 
benefit the ELL students from all ELL sub-groups in their content area classes.  Teachers work as a team to order classroom 
supplies for the ELL students they have in common.  The teachers in consultation with the colleagues on their team as well as 
in consultation with the schools SLIFE teacher and guidance counselors which classroom supplies would be most beneficial to 
the students in all of the schools sub-groups.  This process has been undertaken with a high degree of transparency, with staff 
contributing to and commenting on the purchasing priorities of their colleagues on a shared electronic file, which is reviewed 
periodically as new budgetary resources become available.  Each teacher team selects the instructional material they feel will 
work best for the needs of their individual students.  This helps to best meet the needs of all of our students in the individual 
sub-groups within our school, Newcomers, SLIFE, ELL’s 4-6 years, Long term ELL’s as well as former ELL’s Each team shares 
equally in the school’s NYSTL funds and chooses for itself how they wish to spend the schools their allotment of funds to best 
serve their individual students in all of their content area classes.  Teachers and students in all ELL-subgroups have access to 
classroom sets novels, textbooks, non-fiction, bilingual dictionaries as well as native language books.  We have secured access 
for the students of our school to the campus library, which vastly increases the quantity and variety of resources available to 
our students.  All of the materials are available to all ELL sub-groups. 
Teachers are encouraged to attend ESL conferences to share information regarding various texts as well as other teaching aids 
and in addition our teachers work collaboratively to create their own instructional materials.   Teachers utilize computer 
software, maps, the Internet as well as various other forms of technology which helps to maximize instruction in all content 
areas and within all sub-groups.  Teachers in all content area have access to class sets of laptop computers with Internet access 
as well as two fully equipped computer carts, as well as a smaller cart containing tablet computers.  Teachers are having 
students use power point projectors to share the results of group projects or individual research.  Smart carts with laptops are 
bringing technology into the classroom and extending the number of computers available to students outside the computer 
labs.   
 Additionally, teachers are being added to the MyLibraryNYC program, which allows staff to borrow class sets of materials from 
the school, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens Public library systems.   
 The school team also is amassing a collection of booklists, articles on literacy, and reading programs for reference by the 
instructional teams.  The NYC Writing Project Teaching Consultant additionally recommends texts that address the teaching 
challenges faced by our staff. 
 All students including ELL students in all sub-groups have access to a variety of technologies including a technology lab, 
wireless laptop computers.  Students use various web based programs, including licenses for I LEARN and Rosetta Stone 
blended/distance learning programs 
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

How Students’ native language skills are being used for instructional purposes: 
All our students participate in our language development/ESL program.  All of our classes use the native language to support 
learning.  As described above, the locus of control over language use resides with our students and they use both English and 
their native languages to discover and develop content.  Some projects every year are done in the native languages and in 
English and students are supported in developing their native languages to the greatest extent possible.  Students are 
supported by peers, community partners, family members and/or school personnel. 
 Native language skills are a valued aspect of all subject area classes.  Students will be required to include native language work 
as one component of their portfolio presentations throughout their four years with us.  This native language work is an 
informational, communicative or creative piece in a language other than English, along with a written explanation of the piece 
in English. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
Our instructional teams meet regularly to ensure that required services and supports correspond to ELLs age and grade 
level.  All of the required services for high school-aged ELLs are available to students. We use a wide array of resources in our 
school including teacher-made materials, text books on a range of levels, trade books at many reading levels, and a large 
variety of non-text hands on materials.  In addition, our school has wireless access in all classrooms and students use the 
Internet to access resources.  If a teacher or instructional team is having problems locating published materials that are 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

appropriate to the age of the ELLs then the instructional teams work together to create an adapt material which will be 
appropriate to the age level of the ELL.  Our teachers understand the importance of utilizing materials and resources for the 
ELL’s appropriate age level in order to keep them engaged in learning.  In addition, instructional teams are encouraged to 
attend professional development workshops throughout the year in order to help them better meet the needs of ELLs with age 
and grade level appropriate to the content of the classes.  As veterans of established Internationals High Schools, our teaching 
staff further draws on the capacity of a network of teachers, who share materials as part of a larger learning community.  This 
exchange is facilitated by inter-visitation, participation in workshops and peer observation and feedback cycles. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
It is the philosophy of the school that classroom teachers are the most knowledgeable as to what instructional supplies will 
benefit the ELL students from all ELL sub-groups in their content area classes.  Teachers work as a team to order classroom 
supplies for the ELL students they have in common.  The teachers in consultation with the colleagues on their team as well as 
in consultation with the schools SLIFE teacher and guidance counselors which classroom supplies would be most beneficial to 
the students in all of the schools sub-groups.  This process has been undertaken with a high degree of transparency, with staff 
contributing to and commenting on the purchasing priorities of their colleagues on a shared electronic file, which is reviewed 
periodically as new budgetary resources become available.  Each teacher team selects the instructional material they feel will 
work best for the needs of their individual students.  This helps to best meet the needs of all of our students in the individual

equally in the school’s NYSTL funds and chooses for itself how they wish to spend the schools their allotment of funds to best 
serve their individual students in all of their content area classes.  Teachers and students in all ELL-subgroups have access to 
classroom sets novels, textbooks, non-fiction, bilingual dictionaries as well as native language books.  We have secured access 
for the students of our school to the campus library, which vastly increases the quantity and variety of resources available to 
our students.  All of the materials are available to all ELL sub-groups. 
Teachers are encouraged to attend ESL conferences to share information regarding various texts as well as other teaching aids 
and in addition our teachers work collaboratively to create their own instructional materials.   Teachers utilize computer

blended/distance learning programs. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
This school year launched with an introductory orientation session at the beginning of the school year.  Students receive a tour 
of the school facilities and take part in ice breaker activities in an effort to become more comfortable with the high school 
environment.  During that orientation new students are assessed as to their English language abilities.  The commencement of 
classes saw the new school well below projected (and current) enrollment, so the orientation also served a culture-building 
capacity. 
 New students are assigned to heterogeneous teams (or clusters) with, as far as practicable, students who speak their native 
language.  The new students are then paired with more experienced students who are responsible for escorting them to class 
and lunch, making sure they know how to get home, explaining school rules and customs, and acting as their translator and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

 

advocate in class.   
 During this time a meeting is held with the parents of incoming ELLs to provide them with an understanding of the resources 
available to them at the school as well as within the community. 
 Many similar activities take place when ELL students enroll throughout the school year.  When a new student enrolls they 
meet with their guidance counselor and along with the assistance of a translator receive a one to one orientation to the school 
and the community.  Just as with the students who began in September, students who enroll throughout the year are paired 
with more experienced students who are responsible for escorting them to class and lunch, making sure they know how to get 
home, explaining school rules and customs, and acting as their translator and advocate in class.  These students will also have 
the opportunity to take the LaGuardia Community College native language assessment to determine if they are eligible to 
enroll in native language college classes. 
  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

The International HS for Health Sciences awards six high school credits in the student’s native language as per Part 100 of 
Commissioner’s Regulations NYS, Section 100.5. which is based on students previous language experience in their native 
country plus the completion of a native language project as a part of their graduation portfolio.   
In addition, our students are all eligible to choose from additional blended-learning language modules offered through the 
ILEARN program.  Additionally, we partnered with the FACE Foundation to offer enrichment coursework for native 
francophonic students.  In the future, we seek to transition to a credit-bearing course model for these meetings, and to 
identify partners to offer similar opportunities for speakers of other home languages. 
  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A - Not a dual language program    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
To achieve our instructional goals and implement our core beliefs an extensive structure of professional development has been 
developed.  This professional development structure is on-going and fully integrated into our school structure.   
The principal repository of professional development has been the school's sole instructional team in the school.  The teachers 
meet twice weekly to plan, develop and implement their curriculum and instruction.  The instructional team helps to hire each 
subsequent year's team members through the 18-D, and meet at the beginning of the year to help each other develop 
goals.  They develop and revise curriculum and model collaborative work for their students.  Teachers also meet in cross-team 
groups to share student work and curriculum.  They are also sharing strategies for maintaining project-based curriculum with 
meeting the demands of the Regents exams in the subject areas for which they are administered, as well as for portfolio-based 
assessment. 
 Our instructional team additionally meets regularly to discuss curriculum issues and SLIFE students’ progress within the 
program.  In addition, members of the SLIFE team have run workshops to share techniques on meeting the variety of literacy 
challenges faced by teachers of ELLs.  We continue to work closely with academic experts exploring several approaches in 
order to develop a toolbox of strategies that all of our teachers can use with students and share throughout content areas. 
 See the response under part 4 of this section.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Before the beginning of the school year, IHS-HS conducts an orientation to address details of a student's experience at IHS-
HS.  Once the school year begins, the staff uses the instructional team/advisory structures to create opportunities for students 
to learn how IHS-HS operates and to have input into their academic experience.  Team building is an important component not 
only of helping students to feel comfortable in the school, but as well to model particular components of the IHS-HS 
experience, such as working in a collaborative, multi-lingual environment, presenting a portfolio, etc.  The experience of an 
IHS-HS student is different from that of any of our instructors, so we are conscious to explicitly communicate and reinforce the 
school values of dignity, communication, collaboration and service in an ongoing manner through the year.  Coupled with 
weekly meetings to address social and emotional issues with staff from the Guidance team, teacher are well-prepared to help 
students to overcome not only the transition from middle to high school, but for many, a transition that includes a new 
country, a new language and a new culture, as well.  Further support is afforded by the existence of an Advisory 
Representative system which designates a member of each advisory as an ombudsperson for their peers, that meets twice 
monthly directly with administration to give student voice to issues around the operation of the school, circumstances with 
teachers, etc. 
 As a school that serves a population comprised exclusively of English Language Learners, there is no PD experience that is not 
cast in terms of how it may address the learning needs of this particular population of learners as they work to develop 
proficiency in academic English.  This work is aligned to the standards of the Common Core through the use of shared language 
outcomes across the curriculum.  From the CC standards, INPS rubrics for commencement-level work were developed and 
approved for use by the state.  From these standards, teachers collaborated to develop rubrics appropriate for learners at 
differing levels of English languag acquisition.  A particular CC goal was selected to serve as the focus of this year's work across 
the curriculum.  For this year’s goal of supporting argumentation with evidence, the instructional teams met and completed 
the following school wide goals to help them address the Common Core Learning Standards. 
 In order to assist our teachers of ELLs in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards we have 
planned to offer the multiple opportunities for professional development throughout the year.  These professional 
development sessions are facilitated by fellow faculty members and school administrators.   
1.  INPS Summer Institute (on introducing the Internationals Model to new staff, providing opportunities fro success shares and 
problem of practice foci for returning staff) and Election day PD (implementation of portfolio-based assessment for 
commencement-level work). 
2. Classroom Environment and Assessment 
•     Supporting SLIFE and IEP students to access a rigorous curriculum 
•     Building a supportive classroom environment from the start 
•     NYS Performance Standards Consortium (NYSPSC) Portfolio Rubrics: Getting students to understand them and using 
them          throughout the year as an assessment tool 
•     Using baseline and benchmark assessments that are aligned to the Common Core 
3.  Alignment of Curriculum Meetings (Conducted weekly from 2:45 to 3:45 on Wednesday afternoons) 
•     Sharing unit maps and getting feedback on how to improve use of discipline specific academic language 
•     Sharing baseline and benchmark assessments and getting feedback on how to develop students; skills towards 
higher              levels of NYSPSC rubric in discipline area 
•     Sharing syllabus and getting feedback on coherent curriculum throughout the year that builds on portfolio skills. 
4.  Curriculum Sharing 
•     All teachers bring portfolio project task and sample student work to share 
•     Collect feedback on how well project allowed for students to reach higher levels  of the NYSPSC  rubric, and how project in 
the future can be improved to allow for students to reach high levels of the rubric.  We also train for Portfolio Project Inter-
Rater reliability: 
 Under the PROSE program, in 2014-16, IHS HS has conducted a cycle of non-rated peer observations in which teachers 
observe each other teach and write reflective letters pinpointing new strategies and techniques they have learned as a result. 
 Conferences: faculty attend a variety of external conferences each year in order to keep abreast of new trends in ESL and their

content areas, including: 
 NSTA Using Technologies for instructing ELLs in Math and Science, as well as Diversity Considerations in NextGen Science 
Standards 
All of our teaching staff, which includes teachers who do not hold ESL or Bilingual licenses, are provided with a series of 
Professional opportunities at International High School.  The professional development program focuses on providing teachers 
with various instructional strategies for teaching English Language Learners.  It also focuses on how to prepare ELLs to meet 
and exceed the NYC and NYS performance and learning Standards.  These professional development sessions are facilitated by 
fellow faculty members and school administrators. 
  
1.     Two 2-hour session on supporting SIFE and IEP students to access a rigorous curriculum (Held: August 28&29 2018) 
2.     One 1-hour session on Academic language for ELL students

 Content Integration 
•     Social and Academic language sentence matching 
•     Barrier crossword 
•     Word matching (Nominalization) 
•     Cause and Effect Sentence Combining 
 In addition, our staff participates in the Internationals Network for Public Schools Professional Development workshops: at 
three different points throughout the year our entire staff will meet with their peers from our sister International High Schools 
and attend workshops designed specifically for educators of recent immigrant ELL students.  Topics will include scaffolding 
instruction, differentiation of instruction, ESL methodologies, SIFE students, meeting the affective needs of immigrant children, 
and language development. 
Other members of our non-teaching staff also attend staff development training.  Our School Business Manager and Guidance 
Counselor take part in many of the above mentioned staff development activities along with teachers.  In addition, our SBM 
attends staff development on Election day and our Guidance Counselor attends varied mandatory trainings, including two day 
Respect for all Anti-Harassment Initiative to prevent bullying and bias related incidents, CAP program training, etc. 
 Since all of our staff participates in the above-mentioned professional development opportunities throughout the school year, 
plus many more staff members avail themselves of the professional development opportunities listed in part 2 above, 
everyone receives many more hours than the annual requirement.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We will hold annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs at least one time during each school year, in addition to the four 
regular parent teacher conferences.  At these meetings teachers will discuss the goals of the program, the language 
development process of the individual student, the language proficiency assessment results as well as the student's language 
development needs in all content areas. 
 At this meeting we will have content area teachers, the bilingual guidance counselor, and a school staff member to translate 
as needed.  If no staff member is able to translate than we will utilize the DOE Translation Unit to hold over the phone 
translations. 
The International High School for Health Sciences has teachers working collaboratively on four interdisciplinary teams.  Each of 
the teams meet together to discuss students' language development and content knowledge progress, language proficiency 
assessment results and language development needs during their two hour long meetings each week.  In addition, each 
teacher has an advisory group who they meet with regularly.  They are tasked with communicating especially with the parents 
of this small group of students (15-20 students).  In advisory students participate in goal setting, health education, and socio-
emotional work like Restorative Justice circles. 
 Each interdisciplinary team has 40 minutes of their weekly team time to utilize for parent involvement time.  This period of 
time which is within the teacher's contractual day is specifically set aside for meetings with parents of ELL's.  Each team works 
with our bilingual guidance counselor and our Parent Coordinator in order to place phone calls to parents to schedule 
meetings. 
 In order to ensure that parent needs are accommodated we will utilize our faculty members in order to make phone calls to 
parents to arrange individual meetings.  When a faculty member is not available to translate we will utilize the DOE Translation 
Unit to ensure that all parents receive information about their individual parent meeting in their native 
language.  Our interdisciplinary teams will work with parents schedules to coordinate the best time for the individual parent 
meetings. 
 Teams will document which parents attend their meetings and will make follow up outreach to any parents who have not 
been able to attend a scheduled meeting 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
The International High School for Health Sciences will provide all parents including ELL parents/guardians with the opportunity 
to attend a variety of literacy, math, and homework workshops, so that they can better assist in the education and learning or 
their children at home.  
 Parent Workshops---A series of workshops will be held on different topics of interest to our parents throughout the year.   
 Our PTA will assemble a list of suggested topics and the school does its utmost to accommodate these workshop 
requests.  Possible topics and projected durations based on parent feedback include: 
  
•     One 2-hour session on how parents can help their children to succeed in high school and introducing parents to the 
International HS instructional model.  
•     One 1-hour sessions to: a) Title I Annual Parent Meeting  
•     One 2-hour session on the College Application process and how to deal with financial aid forms and college financial aid 
bureaucracy.  
•     Two 2-hour session on the communication and relationship between parents and their teens. 
•     One 2-hour session on the Jumprope assessment system 
•     One 1-hour session on obtaining NY City Identity cards.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Carl A. Finney, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The data used to access our school’s written translation and oral interpretation needs include data found from a 
variety of sources. The parent surveys and parent selection forms gathered from student permanent records and 
from those filled out by parents when students entering the NYC schools for the first time. Examples of these data 
sources include ATS reports of preferred languages, transcripts from prior institutions, Blue card responses and 
reports from guidance and instructional staff who interact with the students and their family members. We also 
utilize information gathered from our Language Allocation Policy, the CEP, and the School Parent Involvement 
Policy. The policy of International High School for Health Sciences is to provide all parents with written translation 
and oral interpretations through all means available to us.We also utilize information gathered from Part III of the 
Home Language Survey (HLIS), ATS reports, Student Emergency Contact cards, Language Allocation Policy, the 
School Parent Compact, and the School Parent Involvement Policy. The policy of International High School is to 
provide all parents with written translation and oral interpretations through all means available to us.

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

We utilize our regular PD time to update staff on available training and new information. We also have an ESL 
Coordinator (Amanda Vendor) who attend mandated PD and turnkeys to staff. She emails regularly with information 
about translation services and ELL academic policy updates. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

International High School for Health Sciences takes the responsibility of providing each parent with written translation 
and oral interpretation services extremely seriously. Every effort is made to ensure that parents whose primary 
language is a covered language and who require language assistance services with written notification of their rights 
regarding translation and interpretation services in the appropriate covered receive those services as well as 
instructions on how to obtain such services.  

-When a parent enters the school they are greeted by a parent welcome poster conspicuously posted outside the 
main office.  

-When a parent enters the main office a language ID guide is clearly posted at the security desk as well as in the main 
office. 

-At the new parent orientation meetings in August and February parents are provided with the Parents' Guide to 
Language Access. Copes of the guide are also distributed to parents at the four parent conferences throughout the 
school year. In addition, copies of the guide are posted in the main office where translations are made available as 
needed.  

-Notification to our parents is made in a variety of ways. A teacher who serves as a student advisor provides monthly 
newsletters in all the covered languages as well as in a variety of primary languages providing notification of their 
rights. This information is also provided to parents at several points throughout the year. The Guidance Counselor 
holds an orientation for new parents twice a year in August and in February through the Parent Association which 
informs parents of their rights in terms of translation and interpretation services. Translators are provided at each of 
these meetings. Parents are also informed of the translation and translation services at all four parent teacher 
conferences held in September, November, March and in May. 

• The information is to be posted in a conspicuous location near the primary entrance to the high school in the 
covered languages. This notification indicates that a copy of the written notification of the parent’s Bill of Rights 
regarding language assistance services and translation services are available from the staff in the main office, room 
419 and in our Guidance suite in room 311. 

• International High School for Health Science’s safety plan will contain procedures in order to ensure that parents in 
need of language assistance services are not prevented from reaching the school’s administrative offices solely due to 
language barriers.  

• “Each school at which the parents of more than 10% of the children at such school speak a primary language that is 
neither English nor a covered language shall obtain from the Translation and interpretation Unit a translation into 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79 

 

such language of the signage and forms required pursuant to this section and shall post and provide such forms in 
accordance with this section.” At International High School the only languages spoken by over 10% of the students are 
covered languages. (Spanish and Chinese). 

• International High School will provide information in each of the covered languages concerning the rights of parents 
to translation and interpretation services and how to access such services on its school website. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

In order to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services the school will assess the answers 
parents provide in the school survey about whether or not the school is communicating with the parent in their native 
language. Parents who attend monthly PTA meeting will be asked to provide feedback on how well the school is 
providing parents with both written and oral translation services. In addition, whenever our parent coordinator 
communicates with parents she will request feedback on ways to improve communication and availability of 
translation services. We maintain an open-door policy for all parents, and identify staff members and building 
community members who are available to support caregivers in their native languages, to increase the opportunities 
for parents to offer feedback, and identify a teacher Advisor as a point-of-contact for each student. Our Parent 
Coordinator conducts focus groups to engage parents of the cultures represented in our school to assess family 
feedback on school services, and will help to facilitate community walks to engage and connect school and home 
resources.
