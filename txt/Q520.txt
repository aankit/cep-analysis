Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The mission of the Middle College High School at LaGuardia Community College is to serve students who have 
experienced limited success or support, including learning and hearing impaired, within a small personalized learning 
environment that will motivate and empower them to take the initiative for their own academic and personal 
development. Offering concrete academic, social emotional and vocational experiences that connect students to the

world of college and the work force, the school seeks to increase students’ knowledge, expectations, performance, 
self-esteem and respect for all.  

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Middle College High School at LaGuardia Community College has been in existence for forty five years. It has been 
based on and/or near LaGuardia Community College to enhance the high school experience for our students. 
Originally high school students could enroll in college classes based on teacher recommendations. The belief is the 
power of the site is integral to student motivation and success to an enduring collaborative partnership. Students 
share resources and facilities and this helps them to see themselves as a college completer. In 2002 Middle College 
High School was redesigned as an official state endorsed five year Early College High School. All students are expected 
to enroll in college courses to earn college credit and/or an Associate Degree. Students are dual credited earning both 
high school and college credit at the same time.  

The school’s collaborations extend to LaGuardia Community College not only for our students enrollment in college 
classes but our teachers have the opportunity to teach college courses following the college curriculum. We provide 
internship experiences for the colleges education majors in our high school classes and also provide for college 
students internships for the Interpreters Education program. We at times throughout our history have shared 
Professional Development between our teachers and college professors in specific content areas. 

International High School, our sister school and Middle College High School collaborate to create cohort college 
classes which combine high school students from both high schools. Of course we collaborate on many issues 
throughout the school year as well.  

Western Queens Consultation Center services our troubled students and parents and is on campus five days a week. 

We are members of the following consortium's; NYC Performance Consortium and Middle College National 
Consortium. Teachers and administrators attend meetings, share ideas and strategies with other faculty, develop 
workshops, and assist in updating rubrics. Although we are not members of the CUNY Early College Consortium, the 
Principal meets with ECI for selected workshops, our college liaison and College Advisor attends some meetings to 
remain informed and collaborate with this group to ensure students are attending college kick offs and orientations. 

Middle College High School also collaborates with the local YMCA. For a reduced rate we are able to offer Physical 
Education to many of our students during the school year. We do not have a gymnasium and are limited as to time at 
LaGuardia Community College’s gym, therefore we provide for the resources of the YMCA to fulfill requirements. 

In the summer we provide space during our summer program for YMCA children. 

Liberty Partnership, a state funded program, runs on Saturdays and offers our high school students and students in 
Queens the opportunity to register for classes such as SAT prep, digital photography, engineering options, Art in NYC 
and Latin dance. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our special student population is hearing impaired students. These students are mainstreamed into high school 
classes and receive services from the Coordinator and teacher of deaf and hard of hearing students who oversees the 
interpreters assigned to these students as needed. This population excels academically and many are registered for 
college classes to work towards earning their Associates degree and/or college credits. They are accompanied by 
interpreters for all college classes. All students enrolled in college classes are scheduled for a Seminar at the high 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

school to ensure their success academically in their enrolled college courses. Our Special Education population 
receives ICT services as indicated on their IEP. They are assimilated into general ed classes and a Special Ed teacher 
pushes in to provide the extra help needed as well as co teaches with the general ed content area teacher.. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The major area of focus in which we have made the most progress is in instruction. For the past three years our 
Professional Development has focused on literacy across all content areas. First (three years ago) we looked at and 
explored the literacy strategies we used in all core areas and followed through by incorporating them within the 
classroom structure and evaluating student work to look for improvement. Two years ago we unpacked writing, 
looking at it in all content areas. Each department presented how writing is used in the core areas. The faculty was 
asked to implement one or more of these strategies (with modifications if needed) within their content area to a 
target population and follow up on the results for them. Ex: improvement in final portfolio assessment projects, a 
grade of 75 or better in all content areas and the Common Core and/or ELA regents. Our results on both ELA exams 
have increased over the past year and we are gradually seeing improvement in student work. Last year our focus for 
the upcoming year was to build on what we were doing in our Professional Development sessions and extending it to 
student centered instruction. We created four Professional Learning Communities to explore student engagement 
through a systematic peer inter visitation plan. This year we plan to further integrate technology to enhance 
classroom strategies in addition to student centered classrooms. Through consistent and differentiated professional 
development opportunities, teachers will be provided with opportunities to work within departments, grade teams 
and school-wide groups to explore strategies and the impact of a student centered classroom. Teachers are using 
tuning protocols to collaboratively unpack lesson plans and look deeply at student work with a goal of improving the 
quality of instruction, planning and student work products across every classroom. Each department is uniquely being 
supported to tailor professional development opportunities to their content area. Regular meeting time allows for 
teachers to build understanding and consensus each month, explore resources and classroom supports and 
implement strategies. Inter-visitation allows teachers across grade levels and departments to look at the facilitation of 
courses across the school and offer critical feedback to peers regarding the next level of work.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

Our Framework Element score show a 4.37 in rigorous instruction up from last year's data, our collaborative teacher is 
4.15 which has also improved from last year, supportive environment , effective school leadership and trust are all 
over 4.00. . 

The area we need to concentrate on according to the survey element score is strong family and community ties. Our 
outreach to parents is 80% positive. Our problem seems to be parent involvement in the school. Only a small percent 
(36) stated they had volunteered in the school. Although we attempt to have parents volunteer, many of them are 
single parents and work. We hope to extend the opportunity for their involvement this year by having more evening 
events and developing a culminating Expo Night in which students will demonstrate their best work. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019 student progress (students earning 10 credits per year or more) will be increased by 5% as measured by 
NYS and NYC Progress reports.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Develop intervention strategies aligned to Common Core for all 
struggling students through Instructional grade team 
discussions, sharing information and action planning during 
monthly meetings as evidenced by meeting notes. These 
strategies consist of notifying parents, team discussion will 
individual student to provide support needed and parent 
student conferences held by guidance counselor and teachers 
of classes where student is struggling. Instructional team 
meetings will also focus on developing strategies that address 
in depth student discussion. 

 

Benchmark assessments will be completed at 3, 6, 9 and 12 
week intervals by teaches and department teams and 
monitored by administration. As we are on a three cycle system 
and also an Early College, credit accumulation will be monitored 
at the end of cycle one and two. Collection of this data will 
identify those students who are struggling to ensure they 
receive the support needed by mandated them for extended 
time. Parents will receive ongoing progress reports via Engrade 
Pro, mailings and phone calls.

Our Framework element score for 2018-2019 supportive environment increased by .21 over last year's survey results 
with a 90% positive result.for safety, 84 % for social-emotional and ,89% for guidance. Since the overall results are not 
finalized at this time we are unaware of our college readiness index. However 2017-2018 data revealed that we need 
to improve our college readiness index by strengthening our collaborative relationship with LaGuardia Community 
College and providing support for all students enrolled in college classes. This year we will continue to strengthen 
support for all students enrolled in college classes to increase our college readiness index.

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Middle College High School has the ability to attract highly qualified teachers by networking and collaborating with 
colleges and universities within NYC and across the country. We are a part of and member of the Middle College 
National Consortium, and NY Performance Standards Consortium. Located on the campus of LaGuardia Community 
College, enables us to collaborate with CUNY and SUNY education programs. These programs produce teachers that 
are fully licensed in their subject area. When a position becomes available we seek highly qualified teachers who are 
placed in their licensed area. All classes at Middle College are taught by NYS and NYC licensed teachers. 

Professional development is provided by the Administrative staff, faculty and guest speakers. Scheduled sessions 
through the Department of Education and collaborative organizations which focuses on CCLS and Danielson’s 
Framework for Teaching, Understanding by Design, Differentiated Instruction, and data driven decision making, In 
house professional development provided weekly at full faculty/instructional team and department meetings which 
includes examining student work, lesson planning, goal setting, cooperative learning activities, sharing best practice 
and support and mentoring services for new teachers. 

Through our partnership with SUNY and CUNY, highly qualified candidates submit their resume in open market and a 
hiring committee interviews candidates and reviews recommendations. The personnel committee will then submit 
their recommendations to the Principal. The Principal will interview the candidates and make the decision. 

Teachers are invited to attend monthly meetings at the New York Performance Standards Consortium. The focus of 
these meetings is on instruction and assessment. All new teachers are paired up with a mentor teacher in their 
licensed area. New teachers are mentored at minimum 2x a week. All new teachers are part of a peer intervisitation 
team where teachers visit each other’s classrooms and assess the lessons. A debrief protocol is used. New hires are 
asked to reflect on their practice.  

All of our teachers are Highly Qualified as reported on the BEDS survey.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Middle College High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part 
A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy 
to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Middle College High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

Middle College High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act 
(ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by 
Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards on assessments. 

 

I. School Responsibilities: High Quality Curriculum

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Middle College High School uses teacher-created assessments to provide us  with student's grade level in reading 
comprehension, writing, speaking and listening skills.  The results offer a breakdown of specific areas of strengths and 
weaknesses, so we can gear our instruction toward helping the student in areas of academic need and tailor extra help 
specifically geared to those students.    The teacher made assessments allow us to assess student's decoding skills, vocabulary 
and comprehension.  The results of these assessments are shared with our content area teachers.  This information helps 
inform our school's instructional plan allowing us to design curriculum to address the specific needs of students.   In addition 
this data is used to inform our curriculum, instructional approaches and interventions.  Our teachers work to develop reading 
and writing skills through all content areas.  Through this consistent reinforcement of reading and writing in their classes, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

students see improvement in their scores over time. 
     
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Middle College uses the Ell Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) as well as ELA test scores., sample student writing and 8th grade English 
and Math scores and PBAT-Performance Based Assessment Tasks to help with planning instruction.  This information is 
disseminated to our academic teachers as well as our SIT team.  At our instructional grade team meetings teachers make 
specific plans to meet the needs of our ELL students 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our program is measured through the analysis of a wide array of data sources, including: 
•     Graduation rate 
•     Course pass rate 
•     Regents pass rate 
•     Attendance rate 
•     Learning Environment Survey-student results 
•     Learning Environment Survey -parent results 
•     Learning Environment Survey-teacher results 
•     Drop out rate 
•     College class passing rate 
•     Portfolio passing rate 
  
Middle College High School at LaGuardia is part of the New York Performance Standards Consortium which is a network of 
schools who have been granted a variance which allows for portfolio based assessment in lieu of the New York State Regents 
Exams.  We only administer the ELA Regents exam, and therefore have only included our ELA Regents scores in this document. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Instruction focuses on developing skills in both English and Math literacy using  vocabulary learning, oral practice through 
discussion and group work, journal writing and conducting interviews.   This enables students to enhance their reading, writing 
and listening skills which we believe will  help students to achieve higher scores on the NYSESLAT. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
This section while considered does not meet the requirements for high school. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
All seven students have tested as expanding.  The two ninth grade list notice students also have IEP's as well as three 
others  for a total of five with IEP services..  Five out of the seven are Spanish speaking, one is Japanese and one is  Romanian 
speaking.  Students regents grades  as well as PBAT data, student progress reports  will be disseminated to our teacher teams 
including our Special Education teachers, and guidance counselors . 
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

When results are received ,the Language Team review each student's results and meets with the guidance counselor and ENL 
teacher  to recommend strategies that can be used to meet the individual needs of each student.  All of this is communicated 
to the students' academic teachers. Students with IEP's, the Sit team will meet to discuss what further recommendations they 
can make to the instructional team.  An annual meeting is held at the beginning of the school year for all parents of Ell 
students.  Individual meetings are held with the parents of Ell students which includes the Enl teacher, guidance counselor and 
representatives of the instructional team.   Student's progress is discussed and it provides an opportunity for parents to voice

any concerns they may have.  There is continual contact with parents through parent teacher conferences, orientation any 
family nights.  Meetings are conducted  in the language the parents best understands with an interpreter/translator if 
necessary. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

.  Instruction: 
   a. Instruction at our school is delivered collaboratively by teams of four to six teachers who work to plan instruction 
for groups of approximately 90 students.   
   b. Our school uses all of these program models.  Each group of students is  programmed and stranded in groups and 
those students travel together throughout the day.  Within their strands, 9th grade are blocked. 10th grade class is 
scheduled according to access to basic college courses and 11 and 12 grades  are heterogeneous and move across 
subject areas and college access courses.  
c.  Integrated and Standalone ENL are implemented:  Beginning/Entering students will receive a minimum of 540 
minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of ENL standalone, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and 180 
minutes of standalone or integrated ENL (with ELA or any other content area).  Low Intermediates/Emerging will 
receive 360 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 90 minutes of standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated 
ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content 
area.  Intermediate/Transitionsing will receive 180 ENL minutes per week which consists of 90 minutes of integrated 
ENL/ELA or other content area and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area). 
Advanced/Expanding will receive 180 minutes of ENL per week which consists of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA 
or other content area.  Proficient/Commanding or students who are former ELL's will receive 90 minutes of ENL each 
week which consists of 90 integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           2. Mandated Instructional minutes: 
As per the  CR Part 154 requirements, beginning September 2018, students will be carefully programmed to receive the 
mandated ENL and ELA instructional minutes based on new proficiency guidelines.  Beginners/Entering students will receive a 
minimum of 540 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of ENL standalone, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA 
and 180 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL (with ELA or any other content area).  Low Intermediates/Emerging will 
receive 360 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 90 minutes of standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA  and 
90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area.  Intermediate/Transitioning willl receive 180 
ENL minutes per week which consists of 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area and 90 minutes of standalone 
or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area). Advanced/Expanding will receive 180 minutes of ENL per week which 
consists of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.  Proficient/Commanding or students who are former 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

ELL's will receive 90 minutes of ENL each week which consists of 90 integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.  
  The school schedule and teacher programming ensure that all entitled ESL students receive the mandated number of minutes 
required according to CR Part 154.  In addition to our regular content curriculum all ELL students are given extra ESL instruction 
in order to meet the number of minutes they require of ESL instruction each week. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   All of our content area teachers provide content area support for ELL's through all content area classes. All students take 
math, science, social studies, and ESL and/or English every year.  The language that teachers use from the front of the room is 
English, the language of instruction for specific projects and on any specific day is collaboratively determined. Instruction is not 
unidirectional from teacher to student in our school.  Students work in groups to complete collaborative tasks that both 
develop language and content knowledge. 
 In collaboration with our sister school, International High School, Middle College has adopted the International approach and 
the New York Performance Consortium use of performance based assessments (PBATs). This research based instructional 
approach utilizes five strategies which foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core Learning 
Standards.  They consist of heterogeneity and collaboration, experiential and project based learning, language and content 
integration, localized autonomy and responsibility and one learning model for all.  A variety of instructional materials are used 
such as: laptops, library books, work books, dictionaries and teacher generated activities.   Middle College includes an 
approach to curriculum that is student centered, inquiry driven and project based revolving around themes and essential 
questions that provide a balance between content and English language skill building.  Small heterogeneous grouping within 
classes provides a powerful vehicle for English acquisition, wherein students from diverse language backgrounds use English to 
accomplish a given task.  Language and literacy are developed through interaction with peers and teachers about meaningful 
ideas in authentic context.   
In order to provide our students with native language support in the content area we provide our students with bilingual 
dictionaries and peer group support. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  
 At orientation, incoming ELL’s are given a native language assessment.  At the Middle College High School we value student’s 
native languages.  We  offer college native language classes in many languages where students are able to obtain college 
credits for testing proficiency in their native language.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a)     Instructional plan for SIFE Students: 
All students who are identified as SIFE students (Students with Interrupted/Inconsistant Formal Education) are immediately 
placed in our SIFE program where they receive additional support in English literacy until a level of proficiency is achieved as 
determined by the SIFE coordinator and the SIFE Leadership team along with the student’s individual teachers and guidance 
counselors.  The common denominator among these students is a weakness or inability to read or write in their native 
language.  Teachers and guidance counselors identify students who meet this profile through an examination of report cards, 
educational history and student work, student parent interviews and teachers referrals.  Once students are identified to enter 
the SIFE program, our challenge is to find ways to teach students to read and write in English and acquire content knowledge 
when they have limited, if any, literacy skills in any language and may also have serious affective issues as well.   
In order to service students who are struggling, each team has provided extra services:  including one-on-one work with a 
paraprofessional, small group instruction, and after school tutoring.  School-wide, a Saturday enrichment program  with 
Liberty Partnership, has been established, and changes in student programs (such as an extra language arts period) have been

made.  Over the past four years with the money’s from the SIFE grant literacy program an accelerated literacy program was 
implemented school-wide and met with enthusiasm by staff, students and parents. 
Our SIFE model requires three important features: 
  
•     Scaffolding students’ work in regular heterogeneous classes for most of the school day by developing collaboration 
between the SIFE teacher and content area teachers to generalize and practice newly learned skills and strategies across a 
variety of settings.  A team teaching approach would be used in which the SIFE teacher plans with the content areas teacher, 
works with SIFE students in the classroom daily to implement strategies, and also meets after class sessions with the content 
area teacher to discuss students’ work and review lessons and activities. 
•     All SIFE students are expected to attend extra after school home work sessions and are also enrolled in our weekly 
Saturday Explorers club which serves to enhance their literacy skills through exploration of NYC and its environment. 
•     Our SIFE Leadership team has completed a SIFE toolkit which will be shared with other SIFE schools throughout the city.   
•     Our SIFE Leadership team has also hosted a series of Open Houses over the past four years for SIFE Teachers from 
throughout the city in order to share best practices among educators of SIFE as well as all ELL students. 
  
b)     Instructional Plan for Newcomer ELL Students: 
Newcomers to the school, along with their parents, meet initially with a guidance counselor who assesses their needs and 
academic development during intake.  All new students and their parents receive an orientation developed by the guidance 
staff along with the parent coordinator.  All students new to the United States and to NYC are given the NYSITELL exam which 
assesses the students English language abilities.  For students transferring in from NYC schools test results are reviewed and 
students are then matched with teams of teachers who it is felt would best meet the needs of the specific student.  Students 
are placed in appropriate classes according to their specific needs.  The teachers meet in team to discuss the specific needs of 
all new students.  A plan is formulated to best meet the needs of each particular student. 
  
c)     Instructional Plan for Developing ELL's: 
The plan for developing ELLs receiving  service for 4-6 years consists of ongoing support and mentoring. ELLs with 4-6 years of 
service are placed in appropriate classes to best meet their needs and continuing English language development.  Their 
teachers meet regularly in teams to discuss the needs fo the specific students.  A plan is formulated and updated regularly to 
meet the needs of each student.  ELLs who are receiving service for 4-6 years receive a full program and receive all the same 
support structures as the rest of our ELL populations.  Struggling ELLs who are receiving 4-6 years of service are encouraged 
and often mandated to avail themselves of all the extra support opportunities provided to all the students at large.  This help 
takes the form of one-on-one mentoring, small group instruction, after school homework help, the Saturday literacy program 
as well as a variety of other activities.  ELLs with 4-6 years of service are encouraged to try to take some college classes to help 
them to begin the transition towards college life.  These ELLs with 4-6 years who meet regularly with their guidance counselor 
and teachers on their team to receive support and feedback to help assess in their language development. 
  
d)     Instructional Plan for Long Term ELL's: 
The plan for long term ELLs consists of ongoing support and mentoring.  Long term ELLs continue with a full program whether 
they are with us 5 or 6 years and retain all of the same support structures in place for the entire student 
population.  Struggling long term ELLs are encouraged to take advantage of all extra help opportunities provided to the 
students at large.   This extra help takes the form of one-on-one mentoring, small group instruction, after school homework 
help, writing center as well as a variety of other activities.  Whenever possible long term ELLs are encouraged to begin taking 
college classes to help them to begin the transition towards college life. Middle College long term ELLs regularly begin taking 
remedial college classes.  All long term ELLs in college classes receive support from a high school teacher mentor. 
  
e)     Instructional Plan for Former ELL's up to 2 years after exiting ELL status): 
As students reach proficiency and test out through the NYSESLAT assessment they continue to receive a full program of ESL 
services to support and provide for their continued academic growth and development of English proficiency.   Students 
receive  higher levels of of project opportunities and also have the opportunity to take college classes in any of their academic 
areas.  Our school offers thse students the opportunity to receive an Associates Degree from LaGuardia Community College 
along with their high school diploma as part of a five year program.  Students who are determined to have reached proficiency 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

continue to receive support from their teachers as needed.  Former ELLs continue to receive the mandated testing 
accomodations after they they have testied out on the NYSESLAT exam. All former ELLs in college classes receive support from 
a high school teacher mentor. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 Instructional strategies and grade level materials used to provide ELL-SWDs access to academic areas and accelerate English 
language development: 
The guidance counselor, Assistant Principal and Special Education teacher review all IEP’s for ELL-SWD’s to ensure that all IEP 
mandates are being met and to ensure that the ELL-SWD student receives the appropriate program in the least restrictive 
environment.  After reviewing the mandates of the IEP, the full team of teachers meet with the Special Education teacher to 
discuss specific instructional strategies that would prove valuable to the growth of the ELL-SWD student and follow the 
mandates of the IEP.  The team along with the guidance counselor, Assistant Principal and Special Education teacher ensure 
that all of the mandates in the IEP are carried out. If additional support is needed the student is provided with additional 
support services as per the IEP.   
The ELL-SWD students who may have learning needs undiagnosed in their home country, have been here a short time and are 
only beginning to learn English, and/or have experienced serious disruptions and inadequacies in their earlier academic 
preparation are addressed by creating instructional opportunities geared to their needs. Students with Individualized 
Education Plans (IEP's) receive full support from the instructional teams to which they belong. Those students are included in 
mainstream classes, and receive additional services in language, counseling, and adaptive physical education. In biweekly 
meetings, the teachers of our instructional teams meet to review the progress of these and other students. Teams of teachers 
along with the guidance counselors meet regularly throughout the cycle to review the progress of each student in accordance 
with their specific IEP. In some cases, students who are hard of hearing or deaf will undergo and ELAND review to determine if 
the disability is affecting the students ability to test out of the NYSESLAT.   
  
Some of the specific instructional strategies for ELLs depending on the requirements of their specific IEP’s include: Teachers, 
guidance counselors and Special Education teacher meet regularly to discuss the individual needs of the ELL-SWD 
student.  Once students have been identified as ELL-SWD and a program has been established following the mandates of their 
IEP, the challenge is to find ways to teach the student the skills they require while also teacheing the student to read, write and 
speak English and acquire content knowledge when they may have limited, if any academic skills, have specific disabilities as 
described in their IEP and may have serious affective issues as well.  In order to service the ELL-SWD student in the least 
restrictive environment students are mainstreamed into the regular academic class and each team provides extra services: 
including one-on-one work with a paraprofessional, small group instruction and after school tutoring.  School-wide, a Saturday 
enrichment program has been established, and changes in student programs are made to allow the student time to meet with 
the necessary special service provider depending on the students specific needs.   
  
Other strategies include scaffolding students’ work in the regular heterogeneous classes for most of the school day by 
developing collaboration between the Special Education teacher or service provider and the content area teachers.  A team 
teaching approach would be used in which the Special Education teacher plans with the content area teachers to map out 
strategies an best practices and to access the students strengths and area which still need improvement. 
If necessary, ELL-SWD students are expected to attend extra after school home work sessions and are also enrolled in our 
weekly Saturday Explorers Literacy Program which services to enhance their literacy skills through exploration of NYC and its 
environment.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
8. Middle College HIgh School at LaGuardia  Community College uses a variety of curricular, instructional and scheduling 
flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWD’s to attain their IEP goals within the least restrictive environment.  Once 
students are identified ELL-SWD’s our challenge is to find ways to teach students according to the mandates of their IEP’s in 
the least restrictive setting.  The team would meet with our Special Education teacher or service provider depending on the 
needs of that students particular IEP in order to determine the best instructional strategies to meet the needs to that student 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

according to their IEP.  In order to service students who are struggling, each team has provided extra services:  including one-
on-one work with Special Education teacher, small group instruction, and after school tutoring.  School-wide, a Saturday 
enrichment program has been established, and changes in student programs  have been made.  By adapting curriculum to 
enable those students to succeed, by expanding the time available to team members to work with them individually,  student 
teachers and LaGuardia interns, they are supported in meeting the graduation certification requirements.  Our plan maintains 
that our future students with IEP’s will receive additional academic assistance in accordance with the particular needs of their 
individualized IEP’s.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Instruction will focus on developing skills in both English and Math Literacy using English acquisition through new vocabulary 
learning, oral practice through discussions and final project/presentations.  Middle College High Schools instructional focus is 
to improve reading comprehension, argumentative writing and public speaking.  Using interim assessments and PBATS, 
teachers are able to target specific skill sets and plan intervention strategies to support students learning.   
  
Intervention strategies and programs are provided for all ELL students.  These programs target content area in English and 
Math.  We provide a Saturday Catch program, extended time, after school homework help, seminar and advisory.  These 
programs assist students in all of their content areas but a major focus is on ELA/Math and communication. If necessary, native 
language interventions support a student who needs academic support in ELA /Math.   
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Due to the success of our Early College Native language classes and a changing demographic we are planning to 
add Japanese  next year to the growing list of af native language classes that our students take.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We do not plan to make any cuts in our programs or services pending any change in the budget. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Since approximately 2.73% of our students are ELLs and 2% are former ELLs, all school programs are “equal access.” In addition 
to the support and intervention services listed in the answer to question five of this section, we have the following after-school 
classes; while they may not all be “academic” in theme, all of them are designed to continue students’ language development 
through activities incorporating listening, speaking, reading, and writing of English:  
•     SAT Math Prep 
•     SAT Verbal Prep 
•     Chess Club 
•     Student Leadership 
•     Project Adventure 
•     Western Queen Consultation Center 
•     Liberty Partnership 
  
All ELLs and former ELL's are invited to participate in the above listed activities at the time that they register for classes each 
semester. At registration they meet with their guidance counselor and teachers on their instructional team who describe the 
different activities.  Students make a selection with the assistance of their teachers.  
  
In addition, since we are an Early College program all of our students are entitled to take free college level classes at LaGuardia 
Community College.  As part of our Early College Program all of our students ELL and non-ELL have the option to stay for a 5th 
year and earn up to 60 College credits with an opportunity to complete an Associates Degree from LaGuardia Community 
College. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

  
Funding sources for after school and supplemental services offered to ELL’s in our School: 
Since our school funds are conceptually consolidated the funding source for most of our after school targeted interventions 
listed in section 9 above and many of those listed in this section are covered by Title I funding as well as tax levy funding.  The 
funding for the Enrichment class is also covered by regular tax levy funding since it takes place during the regular school day. 
The funding for many of the activities listed in this section above are covered by the volunteer CBO organizations running the 
program. (ie: Liberty Partnerships). 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
It is the philosophy of the school that classroom teachers are the most knowledgeable as to what instructional supplies will 
benefit the ELL students from all ELL sub-groups in their content area classes.  Teachers work in teams to order classroom 
supplies for the ELL students they have in common.  The teachers in consultation with the colleagues on their team as well as 
in consultation with the schoo'ls SIFE teacher and guidance counselors decide which classroom supplies would be most 
beneficial to the students in all of the schools sub-groups.  Each teacher team selects the instructional material they feel will 
work best for the needs of their individual students.  This helps to best meet the needs of all of our students in the individual 
sub-groups within our school, Newcomers, SIFE, ELL’s 4-6 years,, Long term ELL’s as well as former ELL’s.   Each team shares 
equally in the school’s NYSTL funds and chooses for itself how they wish to spend  their allotment of funds to best serve their 
individual students in all of their content area classes.  Teachers and students in all ELL-subgroups have access to a huge array 
of novels, textbooks, non-fiction, bilingual dictionaries as well as native language books.  All of the materials are available to all 
ELL sub-groups. 
Teachers are encouraged to attend ENL conferences to share information regarding various texts as well as other teaching aids 
and in addition our teachers work collaboratively to create their own instructional materials.   Teachers utilize computer 
software, maps, the Internet as well as various other forms of technology which helps to maximize instruction in all content 
areas and within all sub-groups.  Teachers in all content area have access to class sets of laptop computers with Internet access 
as well as two fully equipped computer labs.  Teachers are having students use power point projectors to share the results of 
group projects or individual research.  Smart carts with laptops are bringing technology into the classroom and extending the 
number of computers available to students outside the computer labs.   
Our students have the full use the LaGuardia Community College Library and through inter library loan, the entire CUNY 
system.  Additionally, teachers have made use of library book funds provided by the school to create mobile classroom 
libraries with books that are more accessible and more appealing to ELLs as well as all the other sub-groups of students within 
our school.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Students’ home language skills are being used for instructional purposes: 
All our ELL students participate in our language development/ENL program.   As described above, the locus of control over 
language use resides with our students and they use both English and their native languages to discover and develop content.  
  
In addition, our ELL students whose native language is Bengali, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, Polish and Japanese are identified and 
given a college native language proficiency test in reading and writing which is assessed by the Education Language Acquisition 
Department at LaGuardia Community College.   Each of these college native literature classes resulted in a culminating native 
language project.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
Our instructional teams meet regularly to ensure that required services and supports correspond to ELLs age and grade 
levels.  All of the required services for high school-aged ELLs are available to students. We use a wide array of resources in our 
school including teacher-made materials, text books on a range of levels, trade books at many reading levels, and a large 
variety of non-text hands on materials.  In addition, our school has wireless access in all classrooms and students use the 
Internet to access resources.  If a teacher or instructional team is having problems locating published materials that are 
appropriate to the age of the ELLs then the instructional teams work together to create an adapt material which will be 
appropriate to the age level of the ELL.  Our teachers understand the importance of utilizing materials and resources for the 
ELL’s appropriate age level in order to keep them engaged in learning.  In addition, instructional teams are encouraged to

attend professional development workshops throughout the year in order to help them better meet the needs of ELLs with age 
and grade level appropriate to the content of the classes.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
It is the philosophy of the school that classroom teachers are the most knowledgeable as to what instructional supplies will 
benefit the ELL students from all ELL sub-groups in their content area classes.  Teachers work in teams to order classroom 
supplies for the ELL students they have in common.  The teachers in consultation with the colleagues on their team as well as 
in consultation with the schools SIFE teacher and guidance counselors which classroom supplies would be most beneficial to 
the students in all of the schools sub-groups.  Each teacher team selects the instructional material they feel will work best for 
the needs of their individual students.  This helps to best meet the needs of all of our students in the individual sub-groups 
within our school, Newcomers, SIFE, ELL’s 4-6 years,, Long term ELL’s as well as former ELL’s Each team shares equally in the 
school’s NYSTL funds and chooses for itself how they wish to spend the schools their allotment of funds to best serve their 
individual students in all of their content area classes.  Teachers and students in all ELL-subgroups have access to a huge array 
of novels, textbooks, non-fiction, bilingual dictionaries as well as native language books.  All of the materials are available to all 
ELL sub-groups.

libraries with books that are more accessible and more appealing to ELLs as well as all the other sub-groups of students within 
our school.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Prior to the school year new ELL students are assigned to attend an orientation session at the beginning of the school 
year.  Students receive a tour of the school facilities and take part in ice breaker activities in an effort to become more 
comfortable with the high school environment.   During this time SIFE students are assessed and also students are offered a 
native language assessment by LaGuardia Community College to determine if they are eligible to enroll in native language 
college classes. 
New students are assigned to heterogeneous teams (or strands) with, as far as practicable, students who speak their native 
language.  The new students are then paired with more experienced students who are responsible for escorting them to class 
and lunch, making sure they know how to get home, explaining school rules and customs, and acting as their translator and 
advocate in class.   
During this time a meeting is held with the parents of incoming ELLs to provide them with an understanding of the resources 
available to them at the school as well as within the community. 
Many similar activities take place when ELL students enroll throughout the school year.  When a new student enrolls they 
meet with their guidance counselor and along with the assistance of a translator receive a one to one orientation to the school 
and the community.  Just as with the students who began in September, students who enroll throughout the year are paired 
with more experienced students who are responsible for escorting them to class and lunch, making sure they know how to get 
home, explaining school rules and customs, and acting as their translator and advocate in class.  These students will also have 
the opportunity to take the LaGuardia Community College native language assessment to determine if they are eligible to 
enroll in native language college classes. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

Middle College High School at LaGuardia awards six high school credits in the student’s native language as per Part 100 of 
Commissioner’s Regulations NYS, Section 100.5. which is based on students previous language experience in their native 
country plus the completion of a native language project as a part of their graduation portfolio.   
In addition, our students are all part of the Early College Program at LaGuardia Community College and able to select from a 
broad range of foreign language electives from the college catalog including, Spanish, Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Tibetan, Polish, 
French, Italian, Korean and Japanese among many other languages.  On Wednesday afternoons from 1 PM to 4:30 PM our 
students are encouraged to register for native language elective college classes taught by a college professor which upon 
completion will earn the students from 3 to 6 college foreign language credits from LaGuardia Community College.

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
1. Professional Development Plan: 
  
The principal repository of professional development has been the instructional teams in the school.  The school professional 
development calendar is divided into weekly PD sessions that focus on student work, curriculum and instruction, literacy in all 
content areas with emphasis on ELL and IEP, SWD.   Wednesday meetings are as follows: Two times a month are focused on 
the instructional purpose, one meeting is departmental/content and curriculum and one meeting is "family" where strategies 
are shared to assist students academically and socio-emotional support. BI-monthly PD is scheduled to address literacy in all 
content areas. In addition to the in house professional development, staff are given the opportunity to go to outside 
workshops.  outside workshops have included those sponsored by Central/Superintendancy, NYPerformance Consortium, 
Middle College National Consortium, Laguardia Community College, the Writers Workshop. 
All staff members are required to attend professional workshops for our ELL population.  The information from these 
workshops are then turned over to the faculty and best strategies are shared.   
All professional Development workshops focus on our instructional focus in all content areas. All staff participate in workshops 
throughout the year.  All member of the SBS team such as related service provider, psychologist, para's, guidance counselor, 
speech teacher attend meetings on Ell strategies for students with disabilities.  The Assistant Principals attend professional 
development outside of the school setting.  Ell Teachers attend professional development  meetings from outside the DOE as 
well as from the division of ELL through our borough field support and Affinity support offices.  
For this year’s goals, the instructional teams met and completed the following school wide goals to help them address the 
Common Core Learning Standards.   
  
Goal 1: To create units that help students develop disciplinary and interdisciplinary academic language.

ready.  Over the last few years their workshops have dealt with literacy and numeracy through all discipline studies. 
  
E. Formative Assessment: our staff participates in ongoing professional development throughout the school year in developing 
and refining formative assessments for our school (in conjunction with the NY Performance Standards Consortium.) 
4. Minimum ELL Training for all staff:

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We will hold annual individual meetings with parents of ELL's at least one time during each school year, in addition to the four 
regular parent teacher conferences.  At these meetings teachers will discuss the goals of the program, the language 
development process of the individual student, the language proficiency assessment results as well as the student's language 
development needs in all content areas. 
At this meeting we will have content area teachers, the student counselor, and a school staff member to translate as 
needed.  If no staff member is able to translate than we will utilize the DOE Translation Unit to hold over the phone 
translations. 
  
 Each of the instructional  teams meet together to discuss students' language development and content knowledge progress, 
language proficiency assessment results and language development needs during their bi- weekly two hour meeting. 
Each instructional team has 40 minutes of their weekly team time to utilize for parent involvement time.  This period of time 
which is within the teacher's contractual day is specifically set aside for meetings with parents of ELL's.  Each team is assigned a 
paraprofessional or Community Associate in order to place phone calls to parents to schedule meetings. 
  
2.  In order to ensure that parent needs are accommodated we will utilize our faculty members in order to make phone calls to 
parents to arrange individual meetings.  When a faculty member is not available to translate we will utilize the DOE Translation 
Unit to ensure that all parents receive information about their individual parent meeting in their native language.  Our seven 
interdisciplinary teams will work with parents schedules to coordinate the best time for the individual parent meetings. 
Upon parents arrival to school, they will sign in on a computer in the administration office with translation help when 
needed.  Teams will document which parents attend their meetings and will make follow up outreach to any parents who have 
not been able to attend a scheduled meeting. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

  
Middle College High School provides all parents including ELL parents/guardians with the opportunity to attend a variety of 
literacy, math, and homework workshops, so that they can better assist in the education and learning or their children at 
home.  Due to our partnership with LaGuardia Community College, during the 2018-2019 school year parents of our students 
were invited to register for free Parent ENL classes held at LaGuardia Community College for parents wanting to learn 
English.    
      Parent Workshops---A series of 2-hour workshops will be held on different topics of interest to our parents.  Each year our 
PTA assembles a list of suggested topics and the school does its utmost to accommodate these workshop requests.  This year 
some possible topics and projected dates based on parent feedback include: 
•     One 2-hour session on how parents can help their children to succeed in high school

The parent coordinators role is to support parents and be the liaison between the school and parent communication.  The 
parent coordinator  assists parents in navigating any issues to the appropriate persons at the school.  She also assists in 
translation services in Spanish and assists with the School leadership and Parent/teacher Association.  The parent coordinator 
will also develop workshops for issues facing parents such as immigration laws, English classes for parents.  If a parent needs 
translation services, the parent coordinator will also contact the translation services for assistance.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Socrates Ortiz, Jr- Acting Principal, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and 
activities are adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The data used to access our school’s written translation and oral interpretation needs include data found from a 
variety of sources. The parent surveys and parent selection forms gathered from student permanent records and 
from those filled out by parents when students entering the NYC schools for the first time.We gather data from 
ATS reports and Home Language Survey. The parent coordinator also verifies the data sources by calling the 
homes and speaking with the parents/ guardians of our students. We also utilize information gathered from our 
Language Allocation Policy, the School Parent Compact, and the School Parent Involvement Policy. The policy of 
Middle College High School at Laguardia Community College is to provide all parents with written translation and 
oral interpretations through all means available to us.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

All written and oral communication pertaining to students academic, emotional progress as well as 
permission/consent slips, disciplinary matters and health services are translated in parent’s native language. Language 
translation services are provided in house from teachers, Parent Coordinator, Assistant Principal and through 
LaGuardia Community College, and Middle College High School and assistance from International high School. The 
school maintains records of all primary languages through the Home Language Survey given to parents upon 
enrollment at the school. 

Notification to our parents is made in a variety of ways. The Parent Coordinator and Guidance Counselors hold an 
orientation for new parents in September and the PTA invites new parents for a special meeting in October. The 
Parent Teacher Association informs parents of their rights in terms of translation and interpretation services. 
Translators are provided at each of these meetings. The information is also provided to parents through our 
telephone messenger system which sends out the messages in English and Spanish. Parents are also informed of the 
translation and translation services at the parent teacher conferences held in October and again in March. 

• The information is to be posted in a conspicuous location near the primary entrance to the high school in the 
covered languages. This notification indicates that a copy of the written notification of the parent’s rights regarding 
language assistance services and translation services are available from the Parent Coordinator in the main office, 
room 105. 

• Middle College High School’s safety plan will contain procedures in order to ensure that parents in need of language 
assistance services are not prevented from reaching the school’s administrative offices solely due to language 
barriers.  

Middle College High School takes the responsibility of providing each parent with written translation and oral 
interpretation services extremely seriously. Every effort is made to ensure that parents whose primary language is a 
covered language and who require language assistance services with written notification of their rights regarding 
translation and interpretation services in the appropriate covered receive those services as well as instructions on 
how to obtain such services.

-When a parent enters the school they are greeted by a parent welcome poster conspicuously posted outside the 
main office.  

-When a parent enters the main office a language ID guide is clearly posted at the security desk as well as in the main 
office. 

Copies of the guide are also distributed to parents at the four parent conferences throughout the school year. In 
addition, copies of the guide are posted in the main office where translations are made available as needed.  

-• The information is to be posted in a conspicuous location near the primary entrance to the high school in the 
covered languages. This notification indicates that a copy of the written notification of the parent’s Bill of Rights 
regarding language assistance services and translation services are available from the Parent Coordinator in the main 
office, room 105. 

• Middle College High School’s safety plan will contain procedures in order to ensure that parents in need of language 
assistance services are not prevented from reaching the school’s administrative offices solely due to language 
barriers.  

• “Each school at which the parents of more than 10% of the children at such school speak a primary language that is 
neither English nor a covered language shall obtain from the Translation and interpretation Unit a translation into 
such language of the signage and forms required pursuant to this section and shall post and provide such forms in 
accordance with this section.” At Middle College High School the only languages spoken by over 10% of the students 
are covered languages. (Spanish). 

• Middle College High School will provide information in each of the covered languages concerning the rights of 
parents to translation and interpretation services and how to access such services on its school website. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

In order to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services the school will assess the answers 
parents provide in the school survey about whether or not the school is communicating with the parent in their native 
language. Parents who attend monthly PTA meeting will be asked to provide feedback on how well the school is 
providing parents with both written and oral translation services. In addition, whenever our parent coordinator 
communicates with parents she will request feedback on ways to improve communication and availability of 
translation services.
