Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

At Voyages we believe our mandate is much more than simply helping students graduate, but helping them to be 
great. We believe the word preparatory means our students are empowered with options for life after high school: 
two-year colleges, career/technical schools, and four-year colleges. Our Mission and Vision speak to who we are, 
what we want to be and how we intend to get there.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 

Our Mission: Our doors - and ourselves - are open to young people who need our talent and our understanding and 
our best efforts. Our students need a school that is different, this means we cannot and will not be ordinary 
educators. We will be radical in our pedagogy and connections to youth; we will challenge both our students and 
ourselves. We will develop opportunities to deeply engage in experiences that we - adults and youth - find personally 
and intellectually meaningful. 

Our Vision: Voyages will be a place where students who have struggled and continue to struggle with the 
traditional school model will re-engage in learning. On a daily basis, students will learn about and engage with the 
real world and actively support each other’s struggle. They will care for the worlds they inhabit — their homes, 
their communities, their school, and their classrooms. Staff members will model this process by showing care in the 
way they interact with, support, and learn from each other. Graduates from Voyages will carry special credibility in 
the educational and professional worlds, as being skilled in reading, writing, discussion and problem-solving. We 
will teach students to ask “why?” and search for meaningful, authentic, answers. They will be politically aware and 
engaged; our students will not simply have choices, they will deliberately make choices. We will wholeheartedly 
involve ourselves in everything we do, whether it is a game, a debate, or solving an equation. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

As a LTW Transfer High School, we serve students who are underage and over-credited. Our school is a small, 
intensive-support model; students are supported by CBO-based advocate counselors and receive extensive daily 
outreach, counseling, and college and career support - including paid internships through an LTW grant. In addition, 
we partner with numerous organizations to provide student and family support and professional development and 
coaching for staff. We work with organizations like UnLocal to support students and families struggling with 
immigration and citizenship concerns. We partnered with Artist Year through America Corp in their first year bringing 
Arts Teachers to schools in need, incorporating theatre and performing arts in class curriculum and as after school 
programming. And we also rolled out NYRR RIsing this year as a means of providing students a new way of living an 
active lifestyle. We also initiated the LINCT program this year with one English and one Math Teacher to assist our 
students in reaching College and Career Readiness standards for CUNY Assessment Exams. New Visions for Public 
Schools provides strategic data support, budget consultation, leadership coaching and professional development. We 
participate in College Access for All, which provides materials, curriculum and support for growing our college and 
career readiness work. Through our participation in the Transfer School Institute, we partner with Eskolta and 
ReDesign for strategic coaching and professional collaborations to support our Lesson Study and College Access for All 
work. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our school has a relatively small IEP and ELL population, but we serve over 20 teen parents, 30-40% of our students 
are employed full-time, 20% are court involved, and 20% are in care for mental health concerns, though a larger 
number are "undiagnosed." These issues also overlap with students, so they are often dealing with two or more of 
these circumstances at once. These students each need a combination of regular counseling (including classroom-
based support), adjusted schedules, daily phone/text outreach and home visits, and regular referrals to mental health 
services, legal representation and childcare support. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Rigorous Instruction: 

In 2017-18, we used LINCT coursework and other college-preparatory assessments and data, so that 50% of each 
cohort will register and sit for either the PSAT or SAT in 2017-2018. For 2018-19, we identified that students did 
well in Identifying Key Evidence as indicated in the SAT data and will be switching our instructional focus to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Analyzing and Interpreting Evidence, which was identified as the lowest area for our students. We would like to see 
a 25% increase in the SAT data in this School-wide skill. 

Using PSAT data, 2017-2018 Schoolwide Skills data, and Fall 2018 baseline assessment data, teachers will 
implement strategies designed to improve student scores on Communication Skill by 25%. 

Supportive Environment: 

This year our Homeroom attendance was disappointing, between 5% and 10% all year. However our 1st Period 
attendance increased over last year, and students completed 50% of the credits they attempted this year, an all-
time high. Early morning attendance continues to be a challenge for our transfer population. Many of our students 
work full time, struggle with ongoing health problems or are parents, so early classes are not feasible for them. This 
year we experimented with more engaging early programming, adjust our start time from 8:25 AM to 8:40 AM and 
moved our Advisory period to first as a homeroom opportunity. This will allow us to engage students and dialogue 
about their attendance at the start of the day. 

Collaborative Teachers / Rigorous Instruction: 

This was a very successful year for our Lesson Study program. All of our department teams met regularly for 90 
minutes per week as departments (a first for our school), and each department completed 3-4 lesson study cycles. 
These cycles have grown the inquiry skills of each staff member and built in a stronger, collective sense within each 
department that our lessons can always be better planned to address student learning.  

2018-19 - Developing a protocol for each dept. teachers will plot and share the dept work mid-year for review and 
cross-pollination of the work school wide. 

Strong Family and Community Ties: 

While our survey turnout was not optimal, our parent/guardian response rate increased from 9% to 16%. While our 
PA and SLT were not well-attended, we had robust turnouts for all conference nights and special events. We hope 
to build on this in 2018-2019 by moving the Parent Survey response up to 20% and piloting phone conferencing and 
split meeting formats for SLT/PA to accommodate transfer school population ( as requested by the TSI initiative).

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
We achieved great success this year in increasing how many students register for and sit for the PSAT and SAT. Our 
push to improve college readiness among our students created a huge increase in our 2-and-4-year college 
applications, which nearly doubled in 2017-2018. A number of students scored in the 800-1000 range, which shows 
promise for students being accepted to a wider range of colleges and universities. The PSAT and SAT data, however, 
showed us some skill deficits that we must address in order for our students to consistently score in the 1000+ range. 
We see skill deficits in writing and analysis of text that we can address through our classroom assessment and 
instruction. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Using previous PSAT, 2017-2018 Schoolwide Skills data, and Fall 2018 baseline assessment data, teachers will 
implement teaching strategies designed to improve student scores on our school-wide "Analyzing and Interpreting 
Evidence" Skill by 25%  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 
Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH).

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Our Guidance and counseling staff will conduct regular outreach and host workshops targeting post-secondary exams 
such as PSAT and SAT. This will be key to engaging students with out-of-classroom prep activities. 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
Through PROSE we have a half-day adjusted schedule and teacher time arranged for lunchtime meetings. Our Beyond 
Voyages team meets weekly. In addition, our staff uses a teacher-designed, internal system which collects and 
curates attendance, academic and counseling data across students and subject areas. We use this, in whole-staff, 
small-group and department meetings to review and analyze data in order to make instructional decisions. 

Our partner CBO Queens Community House has at all times 8-10 staff on site, who conduct regular outreach and 
counseling for our students and families. This allows us to target and challenge individual students for registration, 
test-prep and test-taking.  

 
Part 4b. Indicate using an “X” the fund source(s) that will be utilized to support achievement of the specified goal.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
This past year our overall attendance rate was 68%, adjusting for discharges. Our mastery-based teaching and 
learning structures allow students with significant attendance challenges to learn and produce work at a high - 
college-preparatory - level. However within our overall statistics, we saw an average of 10-20% lower attendance for 
1st and 2nd period courses, which speaks to the challenges our students face. At any one time 10-15% of our students 
are parents, or parentified; 30-40% of our students are employed in after-school shift work; and 5-10% of our 
students are in some form of transitional housing. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
In 2018-2019 we have rescheduled our Advisory period to 1st period. This will promote stronger student 
engagement and outreach capacity. By June 2019, the attendance rate for periods 1-3 will be 65%.

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our teaching staff made great leaps in it's Lesson Study work in 2017-2018. Each department completed four cycles of 
the lesson study process, which resulted in the development of two new classroom protocols, an SBO vote to shift our 
staff meeting structures, and the highest class passing rate in our school's history. However we aim to make our 
Lesson Study work interchangeable, between departments and teacher roles, and to incorporate students for 
feedback and co-planning, so there are structures and procedures that will support this transition. 
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, Science and Math teams and English and Social Studies teams will collaborate to develop one common 
procedure or protocol to be used school-wide in Lesson Study work.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In 2017-2018, we increased teacher leadership at Voyages. Teachers took on leadership roles in our Lesson Study 
work, leading to the development of two key protocols, a teacher-designed instructional focus and a shift in our 
weekly schedule. We see a tremendous potential for growth in teacher leadership; as we've set a goal of improving 
student performance on our school-wide skill of analyzing and interpreting evidence. Much of our instructional 
improvements have sourced from strong, consistent instructional practices that teachers developed and refined 
together. In 2018-2019 we've allocated one professional period per week for teachers to share and build strategies 
and structures which will improve student outcomes. 
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, teacher-leaders (C. Suarez, T. Paul-Henry, Y. Glick), in collaboration with Leadership Team, will have 
designed and implemented 2 professional development sessions each, one in each half of the year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In SY 2016-17, our Parent Survey returns were an abysmal 9%. Our goal last year was to improve that number to 30%, 
which we did not achieve, but did reach 16%. This was done largely through outreach bu the CBO counselors directly 
to parents after our PTC night took place and parents/guardians completed forms that evening as they checked in. 
This year, we will be focusing our efforts in having both teachers and counselors reach out to families throughout the 
year and working with our Parent Association to create monthly events that will build up the contact with parents. 
The idea is that parents are also accountable for regular attendance/communication with the school just as their 
students are.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, our Parent Survey response rate for school year will be 2018-2019 will 40% .

Section 7: Support for Students in Temporary Housing (STH)  

 

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in 
DOE systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

In 2017-
2018 four 
(4) of our 
students 
were 
identified as 
STH, 
however 
this year at 
any one 
time 8-10 
students 
may have 
experienced 
interrupted 
or 
transitional 
housing. As 
a transfer 
high school 
our 
students 
are often 
hesitant to 
report their 
housing 
status, 
either 
because of 
their head-
of-
household 
status or 
immigration 
status. 

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          28 

 

Our CBO partner, Queens Community House, provides daily outreach and counseling services to all of our students. 
Counselors will meet with each identified student to determine housing needs upon first enrollment and during bi-
weekly counseling meetings. Depending on student need, counselors will meet with Guidance Counselor, School 
Business Manager and Principal to determine how STH funds may be most helpful. 

Each student identified as STH will receive basic school supplies (notebooks, pens/pencils, folders). In cases of 
emergency, students will be provided with t-shirts, blankets, and hygiene products. 

As part of our PROSE membership we are able to provide students with adjusted schedules; those students whose 
commute to school is impacted by their housing status may receive a schedule without a first or last-period class. In 
addition, those STH students in need of extra academic support will receive such support during our Advisory period 
or in pullout format, as before-or-after school activities may be challenging for them to attend. 

 

Our CBO Director's office and our Principal's office will maintain a basic supply of snacks to supplement STH students' 
meals during the school day. 

 

In addition, CBO counselors and Guidance Counselor will assist students and families in securing housing resources as 
needs arise or as student/family housing status changes. 

 

Part B: FOR NON-TITLE I SCHOOLS 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school (please note that your STH population may change over the course of the year). 

N/A 

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population with the Title I set-aside funds. 

N/A 

 

3. Some Non-Title I schools receive a specific allocation based on the reported number of students living in temporary 
housing.  If your school received an allocation (please refer to the current Title I Funds Summary of School Allocation 
Memorandum), include the amount your school received in this question.  If your school did not receive an allocation 
and needs assistance in identifying resources to assist STH students, please contact an STH liaison.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Voyages staff must be motivated, skilled and very flexible educators, and it is essential that they are valued, 
supported and challenged through our professional development. To this end, each day of our week staff participate 
in – and lead – activities that enrich our understanding of our students and our work, and which ensure alignment 
between classrooms and between our strategies and our needs.  
In order to recruit and retain teachers and staff who best fit our school, Voyages works with our PSO (New Visions for 
Public Schools) and our CBO partner Queens Community House to maintain a presence at most hiring fairs and 
publications related to staff recruitment. Each of our current teachers has multiple opportunities for teacher-
leadership throughout the year, through our project-based staff work model. By meeting with the principal in two 
additional one-on-one meetings (December, March) above and beyond the required IPC and end-of-year conferences, 
each teacher is able to set and monitor their own professional goals and growth. 
 
This year we selected three skilled, veteran teachers to take on formal leadership roles. Christian Suarez, Social 
Studies teacher, and Yael Glick, English teacher, will be Model Teachers; Tanya Paul-Henry, Math teacher, will be our 
Peer Collaborative Teacher. We believe this will both retain staff and grow future school leaders. 
 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Our weekly rotation includes an all-staff meeting, during which CBO and DOE staff review the important issues and to-
do’s for our school; weekly reflection, during which all staff share and discuss their week in a circle meeting format; 
project meetings, during which small staff groups lead by teacher-leaders analyze and/or problem-solve key school 
components or initiatives; department meetings, during which teachers look at student work and focus on aligning 
their instruction; and professional learning, where teacher-leaders facilitate learning around instruction, assessment, 
advisory facilitation and curriculum design. 
In addition, our teachers receive differentiated trimester meetings with the principal and AP, where we discuss and 
set goals and areas of support, including outside professional learning or participation in school-based coaching.

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Each August and September, our Instructional Lead convenes a teacher meeting to discuss how state and local 
assessments will reflect our instructional focus and goals and each teacher’s professional learning and development. 
Our MOSL committee consults formally on these decisions, but our teaching staff is small (16) and therefore we insist 
on maximum exposure and consultation on these decisions. 
 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another

purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Voyages Parent & Family Involvement Policy 2018-2019 
Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Voyages Preparatory, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 
 

Our  school’s  Parent  Involvement  Policy  was  designed  based  upon  a  careful  assessment  of  the  needs  of  all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our 
school  community  will  conduct  an  annual  evaluation  of  the  content  and  effectiveness  of  this  parent 
involvement  policy  with  Title  I  parents  to  improve  the  academic  quality  of  our  school.  The  findings  of  the 
evaluation through school surveys and feedback  forms  will be  used to design strategies to more effectively 
meet the needs of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by 
the school.  
 
In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of 
the school’s Parent Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on 
the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Voyages Preparatory will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement 
level, e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 
decision making in support of the education of their children;

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Because we are a high school, we do not use early literacy tools. We do use MOSL tasks to determine literacy needs, and use 
baseline assessments in subject area classrooms to determine literacy strengths and areas of need. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Departm 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

We evaluate the success of our program for ELLs by tracking credit accumulation, PSAT/SAT, Regents pass rates 
and  accumulating credits and passing their Regents exams.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Because we are a high school, we are not using data to guide instruction within the RTI framework.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Historically, our ELL data patterns indicate that our students do better on listening and speaking than they do in reading and 
writing.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

ELL students receive 275 minutes per week of English instruction. Depending on need, ELL students receive services in 
a sheltered English class taught by a dually-certified ESL/ELA teacher. Advanced ELL students receive one period of 
sheltered English daily, and an additional period of ELA through a certified ELA teachers. We do not currently 
have  any ELL students. However, any beginning- or intermediate-level ELL students would receive a second period of 
sheltered English (taught by a dually-certified ELA/ESL teacher.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Given that we are a transfer school, all students have individualized programs. ELL students, therefore, do not travel as a block. 
With the exception of pull-out services, ELLs receive instruction in heterogeneous classrooms. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
ELL students receive services in a sheltered English class taught by a dually-certified ESL/ELA teacher. Advanced ELL students 
receive one period of sheltered English daily, and an additional period of ELA through a certified ELA teachers. We do not

currently have any ELL students. However, any beginning- or intermediate-level ELL students would receive a second period of 
sheltered English (taught by a dually-certified ELA/ESL teacher.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We have a bilingual AP and advisor who coordinate assessment with a student's teachers to ensure assessment is language-
appropriate.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Each student at Voyages is evaluated - in collaboration between the counselor, teacher, student and family - to determine 
which the type and degree of support a student needs upon intake. For students who are SIFE and Newcomer, our counseling 
staff works with the family and teaching staff to ensure that appropriate social/emotional supports are in place; a detailed 
school history is taken during the intake process.    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
All of our student schedules are individualized, and all of our IEP students receive SETSS, therefore we are able to maintain 
schedule flexibility with both push-in and pull-out services. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
All of our student schedules are individualized, therefore we are able to maintain schedule flexibility with both push-in and 
pull-out services.     
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
We provide tutoring through our CUNY internship program in Spanish and English in ELA and Social Studies; our counselors 
(bilingual counselors are assigned to all ELLs) work with ENL and other teachers to ensure students are academically engaged 
and supported. Some of this is done through push-in support; some, during our Advisory period (every day 5  th   period) and 
half-day Wednesday schedule through one-on-one corrective teaching.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

N/A 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELL students are provided equal access through consistent home outreach in Spanish and English (and translation in other 
languages, where necessary), and facilitation during after-school by bilingual staff. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Any and all materials that need to be adapted are addressed by our AP and ENL teacher, in conjunction with our CBO staff. In 
addition, we use Google Classroom and Google Docs, which are translated when necessary. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

The HLS form, completed upon intake. Once determined, the AP, Guidance Counselor and CBO determine the best fit for the 
student and family's counseling and instructional needs. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

We are a mixed-grade, transfer high school. Each students' services and schedule are individualized, based on their academic 
needs and progress toward graduation. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We share a building with two high schools: Civic Leadership High School and Pan American International High School. Pan 
American is part of the International schools network, and a community school grant recipient; Our CBO provides extensive, 
bilingual counseling and outreach to students and families. 
However, we intend to request some access to coursework (in particular any coursework for ELL students beyond basic 
Algebra or Living Environment, and Regents Prep for exams such as Earth Science, Chemistry, or Geometry).  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
All families and students participate in both individual interviews and group orientations during their intake process. During 
the individual interviews and in subsequent guidance counselor meetings, staff discuss progress, academic data and possible 
supports or interventions. 
  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Rosetta Stone  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All of our relevant ELL personnel attend all district-provided trainings that we agree are beneficial. In addition, the principal 
meets with every staff member three teams per year to discuss their roles, responsibilities, needed supports and goals. Notes 
of these meetings are kept in a Google Document shared between the staff member and the principal.    
Our teaching staff meets three times each week - once for professional learning related to schoolwide goals and targeted 
instructional efforts, including how we address subgroups (This allows specific teachers to target the areas of their work where 
they receive feedback).; once for departmental planning and data analysis; and once as a whole staff to share student 
academic, attendance and counseling data. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
None of our students are transitioning into high school, as all have attended at least one year of high school prior to their 
admission to Voyages. However through our counseling and Advisory program, we provided scaffolded instruction and support 
in the following areas: classroom habits; self-advocacy with teachers and potential employers; and college and career 
planning.  
As stated above in Question 2, our teaching staff meet multiple times each week, targeting a range of professional learning 
needs and goals for our staff; our meeting agendas and notes are kept in Google Docs.    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
All families and students participate in both individual interviews and group orientations during their intake process. During 
the individual interviews and in subsequent guidance counselor meetings, staff discuss progress, academic data and possible 
supports or interventions.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
All of our family meetings are conducted in English and Spanish; many of our families have concerns relating to college access, 
citizenship and ENL, and discussion focused on communicating with older students (our population) about prioritizing school 
and post-secondary options; we offer workshops in these areas where there is demand both through our PA and through our 
CBO partner.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Nicholas Bleiberg, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

During our new student intake, all students and families are interviewed, and key DOE paperwork is completed 
with a CBO (Queens Community House) staff member present; in addition, counselors review all relevant data 
and paperwork. Aside from standard ATS reports and files from previous schools, our CBO uses family interviews 
and surveys establish the needs and prefererences of our incoming families.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
