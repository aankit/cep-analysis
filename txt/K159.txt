Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our P. S. 159 mission is to provide our students with cognitively challenging, differentiated and equitable learning 
experiences in a warm, supportive environment which affords them the education necessary for college and career 
readiness. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 159K, The Isaac Pitkin School, is a Title I elementary school (Kindergarten – 5 th grade) serving Brooklyn’s East 
New York. Population demographics reflect a community that is in constant flux with multiple first generation 
populations from Africa, Bangladesh, Asia, the Caribbean islands, and South America.  

The diversity of our families and children asks us to be responsive to a variety of educational styles, social and 
emotional needs, and family structure. There are also students who live in shelters, foster homes, or commute from 
other NYC areas. As a result, we offer bi-lingual and specialized classes, student and family counseling services, health 
and education programs, and links to many NYC city-wide resources. The foundation of all our education initiatives 
continues to be a celebration and respectful collaboration with individual students, their families, and the 
communities within East New York.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We continue to receive newly arrived students and transfer students in all grade levels who have an interrupted 
formal education (SIFE), need remedial survival and academic language instruction, and family counseling and legal 
services. There has also been an increase in Special Needs and General Education students both with more needs for 
specialized instruction and social services. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our school's instructional focus is to strengthen our children's questioning and discussion techniques. Our goal is to 
give students the written and orals skills needed so they can generate their own higher order thinking questions and 
capture their ideas in writing and presentations. Students will become critical thinkers with strong oral and written 
communication skills to prepare them for high education and career readiness. We support this initiative to create 
2`1st century learners with modeling and encouragement in all instructional opportunities. 

For the 2018-2019 school year, we are excited to morph our school into a math-based platform where math is 
integrated into all core curriculum areas. Teachers and classrooms have moved away from traditional math 
instruction to a more non-traditional instructional model where students are taught math using real-world contexts 
and situations. We are committed to providing all grades new and modified reading and math instruction with an 
emphasis on manipulatives and word-based math problem solving. Math supports and challenges are integrated into 
our entire building and you can see math problems/challenges posted on walls, in classrooms, and peppered into 
conversations. Our daily math block has been increase to three times per week and moved to mornings when we 
believe students are more rested and open to learning. We have also invested in new technology so the math 
program can be extended and enhanced with online resources such as Mathletics and MathPlayground and Osmo 
tablet math learning games.  

We will continue our in-depth examination and development of each curriculum that meets the needs of our diverse 
learning populations and ensures that our instruction is engaging and rigorous, with coherent curricula in all subjects. 
Instruction, which is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and/or content standards, is dynamic with daily 
modifications and adjustments so that all learning is accessible for our variety of learners. 

Our school has developed the teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best. In an 
open and active forum we work collaboratively so that all curricula is Danielson-based, culturally responsive, 
equitable, rigorous and engaging, and meets the needs of all learners so that all students produce meaningful work 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

products. We believe that equity is fundamental to student achievement because it allows us to value each and every 
student at our school, including SWDs and ELLs.  

We also recognize that quality data assessment is pivotal to move our instructional platform higher. Our investment in 
technology positions us for developing online student assessments which can be used for identifying trends, 
modifying instruction, and addressing individual student strengths, weaknesses, and needs. Based on observations 
and data analysis we recognized that our teachers’ assessment practices across the vast majority of classrooms did 
not contribute to a clear portrait of students’ mastery of learning goals and could not be consolidated for comparative 
and quantitative analyses. As a result for the 2018-2019 school year we now have: 

1.  DRA kits and teacher training: To ensure uniform use of the DRA program teachers were trained in 

September. We feel confident that we will now have more accurate, consistent, and reliable data throughout 
the school year. 

2.  Professional Developments: Professional developments are targeted to give teachers the techniques and 

skillsets necessary to support their performance including conferencing, data analysis, and the development 
of SMART goals, both on the individual and team levels.  

3.  On-going assessment modifications: Assessments are aligned to curricula and used for on-going assessment 
and grading practices. We analyze information on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions 
at the team and classroom levels.  

4.  Development of integrated and technology-based teacher/administration assessment tools and practices 

that are aligned to curricula, to check for understanding, provide actionable feedback on student 
performance and engage students in self-assessment.  

5.  Student self-assessment checklists and rubics: While most student work uses checklists and rubrics to self-

assess we have developed work rubrics that clearly specify what students need to do as next steps to improve 
their work, based on the feedback noted on the work displayed. Teachers us tools such as whiteboards, exit 
slips, stop and jot, thumbs up or thumbs down, along with questioning and conferring with students to check 
for understanding. 

Understanding our changing student demographics we have Bengali bilingual Kindergarten and Dual Language 2nd 
grade classrooms. This is also a way for us to become more desirable to new immigrant families.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
P.S. 159 demonstrates a consistent strong approach to rigorous instruction with our program differentiation and 
customization, targeted program modifications for skill set acuity, and data-based instruction.  

Our Balanced Literacy program now incorporates the Super Readers social/emotional components. The Super 
Readers seven components (Belonging, Curiosity, Friendship, Kindness, Confidence, Courage, and Hope) enhances our 
reading and writing teaching as we strive to instill these seven characteristics in each of our students. Our goal is to 
create and support joyful readers. 

Our overall literacy model includes reading, writing, grammar, and oral skills. Teachers model these skills and 
incorporate the use of them in all lessons. We believe that by bringing reading off the page and into social discussions 
we can build and reinforce these skills. Student engagement and understanding can be maximized through active 
participation, conversations, and the creation of tangible standards-based products, based on standards based 
formats. As we continue to develop more ongoing assessments, analyze data, and get a more real-time status our 
school’s education programs, we plan to embed more student-directed questioning strategies and techniques. 
Student-driven dynamics will continue to drive our instruction and outcomes.  

Our Balance Literacy literacy program provides students the questioning and discussion techniques needed to 
increase their reading comprehension. We expect students to have the background and skills needed to generate 
their own higher order thinking questions and to be able to capture their ideas in writing and presentations.  

This year we experienced a 10% increase (5 students) of SIFE students. These students are categorized as having an 
interrupted or no formal education. They receive ninety (90) plus hours of language instruction in small groups that 
focus on basic Spanish and English phonics, vocabulary, and language skills.  

The PS159 ELA test scores show that our 3rd and 4th grades increased in their passing percentages, however, the 5th 
grade scores fell 3% below passing. (Progress measures improvement from 2017 to 2018, in terms of percentiles.)

This data indicates that in K, 1, and 2 our combination of reading and phonics programs coupled with various reading 
initiatives has better prepared our 3rd graders.  

While both 4th and 5th grades had a larger percentage of pass than fail, the overall amount of students passing was in 
the high seventies, rather than the eighties or nineties where we had hoped. We believe this is a result of more 5th 
grade students enrolling without any English language skills and also having low level language and reading 
backgrounds.

Based on our final test scores we have begun implementing the following program changes/modifications to the 
reading and literacy programs for the 2018-2019 school year:

strategies.)  

  Additional ITC classes for smaller classrooms and stronger differentiation based on learning styles and needs. 
  Emotional/socialization programs and services so children are more receptive to learning and ready to take on 

more academic challenges in all content areas. 
Incorporate more vocabulary and literacy into our science program.

Science non-fiction reading libraries in all classrooms. 

_____________________________________________________________________ 

Overall 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades showed a three (3)% point decline in ELA scores with 5th grade coming in the lowest 
of the three grades. 4th grade maintained a sustaining level with 3rd grade showing a slight decrease in scores as 
compared to both the district and city. 

The data indicates that Grades 3, 4, and 5 scored lower in standards that require them to engage with informational 
text. The item analysis from the 2017-2018 state exam also reveals that students need more explicit direct instruction 
in writing and answering written responses to and about text. 

 

Using these focus standards we have made instructional modifications and additions that will help reinforce ELA skills.  

3rd Grade Next Steps: 

  Guided Reading that addresses specific skill sets 
  Using state exam rubrics for short response and constructed response questions (throughout the year) 
 
  Practice short responses 
  Creating and developing higher order thinking questions. 

Self assessment/peer assessment 

4th Grade Next Steps: 

  Practice annotating 
  Use of rubrics to peer and self assess 
  Questions (how to form a question) 

5th Grade Next Steps: 

Short response practice  

 
  Use of rubrics to self assess 
  Practice annotating text 

 

Focus Fridays for grades 3, 4, and 5 provide a concentrated ninety-minute instructional period that focuses on literacy 
and math extension activities for the content taught that week. This can include reading more rigorous non-fiction 
text, answering skills for short response and multiple choice questions, and literacy/math real-world problem 
challenges. Each week teachers customized instruction based on developed and approved lessons that include 
homework and projects. Student progress is tracked with bi-weekly assessments.  

To strength student language skills we offer: 

1.  Remedial and Intervention services (RTI) are provided to those students needing additional instructional 

support. This past school year we provided services to more students needing intervention, rather than 
remedial instruction. With more students deficit in basic grammar and reading skills we are in the process of 
further modifying and adapting our instructional strategies. RTI instruction is conducted by Resources 
Services, both inside and outside the classroom, with small-group and one-on-one learning time with 
teachers. End-of-program assessments showed an increase of two (2) DRA reading levels. We predict each 
child receiving RTI services will show a marked improvement on their state test scores. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16 

 

2.  ENL Instruction: All former ELLs receive ninety (90) weekly minutes of integrated ENL instruction.  
3.  Afterschool Academics: Targeted instruction is provided to our lowest third during after-school sessions. 
4.  Parent Academic Presentations and Workshops: We offer unit content reviews and overviews of the ELA and 

Math program on-line resources. 

5.  Modified and Specialized Instruction: Incoming Special Needs students fall into the categories for 

Comprehension Disability, and Physical and Cognitive Involvement. For these students we continue to modify 
classrooms and instruction to meet the variety of their individual learning and emotional needs**:

  Counseling ( Individual and Family) 
  Modified Promotional Criteria 
  Differentiated instruction based on IEP goals 
  Technology-based hands-on activities 

Another goal is that our students become critical thinkers with strong oral and written communication skills to 
prepare them for higher education and career readiness. We support this goal with the increased use of technology 
tools in all classrooms. Students are provided computer instruction on presentation software and are given 
opportunities to use classroom SMARTBoards and other technology devices to present to parent and administration 
audiences. We also have Student Tech Teams that conduct SMARTBoard and software training to teachers and 
students.  

Our school goal is to provide all students with the tools and academic content necessary to become independent 
confident students. Within the classroom, discussion and team discovery activities encourage students to confidently 
communicate their ideas, ask for clarification, and share their opinions. We expect our students to develop the ability 
to read and analyze literacy and math texts and to formulate their own opinions. These opinions should be logical and 
well-supported, with a self-assessment component. 

*A comparison across classes shows a strong correlation of low scores with low attendance, older incoming ELLs, and 
behavior issues.  

** Many services are Push In and Push Out with instructional goals based on student Individual Education Plans (IEPs).  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June of 2019 the percent of ELLs scoring Level 3 or above will increase by 10% due to our integrated ENL services, 
instructional modifications, and student self-assessment skill development.

SIFE students (5 students) will be given additional pull-out 
instructional times to acquire basic language and reading skills. 

 

Classroom teachers can now instruct former ELLs which is done 
in the classroom setting. 

 

Administration will conduct observations and conferences with 
ESL Coach to ensure that program recommendations and 
modifications are being implemented based on language needs.  

Remedial and intervention services support ELL students with 
additional support and instruction using MyOn and Voyager. 

For Students with Disabilities, English Language Learners, and 
other high-need student subgroups: 

● Teachers continue to refine systems regarding: gaining entry 
points into interactive lessons through scaffold supports in the 
form of visual aids, teaching implicit and explicit vocabulary, and 
modeling the thought process for students (think aloud). 

● Teachers modify systems regarding student assessments, 
critique lessons and develop student rubrics and checklists that 
foster independence from teachers.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
PS 159K is dedicated to the success of students and is committed to providing each student the tools and experiences 
needed to achieve and succeed both academically and socially. By providing safe and nurturing school and classroom 
environments we develop students who are confident and independent learners willing to take chances and succeed.  

We continue to find activities that help c 

The Super Readers program, a character education philosophy, enhances our teaching by instilling in each classroom 
the seven reading strengths - Belonging, Curiosity, Friendship, Kindness, Confidence, Courage, and Hope. We strongly 
believe that creating a nurturing classroom based on these strengths will give all our children the socio/emotional 
components that will connect them to all learning.  

We have modified our classrooms to accommodate those students with learning and emotional needs who need help 
self-regulating and focusing. For many, being able to move is an important outlet and we provide flexible seating as an 
option for those students who have trouble sitting still for long periods of time. Classrooms have "Reading Nooks" 
that provide students a comfortable thematic reading area. The idea is to create a more comfortable environment 
that helps students be their best learning selves. Flexible seating asks students to choose where they sit daily, but 
wherever they choose to sit, it has to help them be their best learning self. There is power for them in the choice to 
select where they will work. For example, in some classrooms students have the choice to sit on a yoga mat or a 
Wobble Chair, or do their work standing up. They know the work isn't optional, but choosing where they work is. As 
we receive more students with behavior and special learning needs we will be tracking the success of flexible seating 
and modified classrooms and anticipate a more positive outcome and higher performance for such students. 

Always our goals are to:  

  Continue providing a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students, and 

families, and provide supports to achieve those expectations. 

  Maintain a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that support the academic and personal growth of 

 

students and adults.  
School leaders with the School Leadership Team make deliberate decisions and organizational 
modifications that advance instructional goals and support student learning. (1.3)  

  Weekly parent conferences allow teachers and families to foster a stronger link to support clear performance 
expectations and work ethics that are critical to achievement and success. For those families who do not take 
advantage of these Tuesday meetings, we provide alternative communication links including e-mail and 
phone support.  

  Posted expectations for achievement and success in all classrooms are prominently displayed. Routines are 
well understood and students are expected to comply with standards of conduct listed in the family contract 
agreed upon at the beginning of each school year. We recognize that consistency of school and classroom

rules and policies provide students an environment that is safe and predictable. This type of environment 
fosters all children’s ability to focus and thrive and provides families with clearly defined guidelines. 

The Framework for Great Schools makes it clear that for students to achieve and progress, they must be supported 
socially and emotionally, as well as academically. We recognize and understand that social-emotional competencies 
involve skills that enable children to calm themselves when angry, initiate friendships and resolve conflicts 
respectfully, make ethical and safe choices, and contribute constructively to their community. 
 

Each year many more students are coming into our school without having learned these skills at home. Teachers, 
School Counselors, School Leadership, and paraprofessionals have requested more training in this area. We believe 
that for students to progress academically, we need to prioritize the implementation of those approaches and 
teaching methodologies that facilitate the teaching of these skills within our school community and classrooms. 
Professional development sessions that focus on behavior management and special needs children are scheduled for 
this year and will be presented by administration and our Special Needs teachers.  

Established programs are our anti-bullying program in place (Hands-Off Thursdays), as well as programs for character 
education (The NED Show, TAG, Character Education/Book of the Month, Mutt-i-Grees, and Respect For All Week). 
This year we began Boys Basketball Club and Girls Softball League. We plan to increase our ability to address all 
students’ social and emotional needs through the addition of new programs and staff professional development 
training for peer mediation and conflict resolution. Targeted groups are being supported through team activities, 
award ceremonies, and trip adventures.  

Designated students are taught a self-monitoring behavior plan where they are actively involved in understanding and 
monitoring their own growth and learning. (We anticipate student behavior will improve from year-to-year as well-
adjusted behavior becomes ingrained and habitual. We are examining behavior statistics for trends and incident 
reductions (SOHO).) 

Our Remedial and Intervention services (RTI) are provided to those students needing additional instructional support. 
This instruction is conducted by Resources Services both inside and outside the classroom with small-group and one-
on-one learning time with teachers. In addition, we have after-school programs for both low and high-end students to 
reinforce and extend learning. These services are geared to develop confidence in the students so they can succeed 
with academic skills and personal growth. 

The Parent Coordinator and Family Coordinator are responsible for developing trust and understanding between the 
school staff and families through timely communications including meetings, phone and on-line to discuss academic 
issues and/or successes. Again, it is our goal that all children succeed and families are confident in the quality of their 
child's education at PS159. 

We recognize that chronic lateness and absenteeism are on-going problems and we are working hard with families to 
provide links to city and health services so children can begin their school day nourished, prepared and on time.

Our Parent Teacher Association is charged to provide families with a variety of communication channels and links 
between school administration, the Parent Coordinator, and teaching staff. Additional family programs and 
workshops continue to pull parents and caretakers into the school which fosters and improves trust and 
understanding while establishing stronger links between families and the school. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of our students will feel that their social and emotional needs are being met by more student 
oriented classroom settings and student directed learning dynamics, as measured by bi-annual school-created surveys 
and parent focus groups . We will continue to support the social and emotional development of all students so that 
they will feel known and supported by the adults within our building, and able to interact productively with their 
peers. As a result, we expect a 35% decrease in school suspension rate as indicated in OORs.

Teachers and other staff members will receive additional 
training on how to better support the social and emotional 
development of students in their classrooms. We will focus in 
the first three months of the school year training in Escalation to 
better provide teachers the strategies and clearly defined 
policies for student behavior and consequences. 

 

All students will receive social emotional training, both in the 
classroom and with Counseling Services. The expertise of 
outside programs, such as The NED program, will be coupled 
with the experience of in-house personnel (social worker, 
guidance counselor, school psychologist), to increase teachers’ 
feeling of competence in this area.  

 

Technology will be updated and activities bookmarked for quick 
and easy access for students and families for more effective and 
efficient use of academic and NYC DOE on-line resources.  

School leadership will ensure that available supports are 
increased for all students. Budget and scheduling will be 
maximized to ensure that either the social worker, guidance 
counselor or school psychologist are available as many days of 
the week as possible. Students will continue to be 
recommended for at-risk counseling, as warranted. Fifth graders

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

P.S. 159 has been transformed into a "Working Math Lab" where math is the foundation for all learning. Instead of 
compartmentalizing math instruction we are now incorporating math into all subject areas including science, coding, 
computer, music, physical education, and dance. Our GoMath! program is being enhanced with more problem solving 
STEM activities in partnership with science, art, and coding. Students are encouraged to use math for building and 
exploring whether it's a Native American lodge house in social studies or a suspension bridge in science - both using 
measurement standards.  

We use horizontal and vertical collaboration between grades and classes to enhance our Ready Math and GoMath! 
programs to achieve our math goals. This provides real-time assessments to qualify and quantify trends that 
demonstrate student strengths and weaknesses. Problem areas and skills are then re-taught and reinforced in Focus 
Friday challenges. 

Students take mathematics benchmark assessments three times a year and complete GoMath chapter assessments to 
assess mastery of mathematics standards and skills. Teachers adjust instruction accordingly. Last school year, we 
made an instructional decision based on teacher and provider input to change the math core curriculum to Ready, 
supplemented with GoMath. This change resulted in a noticible decline in student math proficiency level on the state 
exam. As a result, we have decided to go back to GoMath with Ready as a supplement. In addition, we’ve also made 
math a focus throughout the school, posted math problems in the halls, and have Focus Fridays for math problem 
challenges. 

Also, we have created a new Math Lab with a dedicated math teacher. Targeted 4th and 5th grade students who rate 
at the bottom third (1/3) push out of the classroom for small group instruction on targeted content areas (as based on 
the GoMath assessments) including fractions, operations, place value, decimals, and measurement. At the Math Lab 
students are provided remedial and intervention skill building with engaging hands-on activities. Ongoing assessments 
tracks their progress and helps the instructor modify instruction where needed. 

Analysis of our math and science data shows that a shared area of weakness continues to be measurement. Our math 
coaches and science teacher are working cooperatively to provide more measurement problem solving activities to 
classrooms starting down at Kindergarten. Our goal is that students understand how to use measurement tools and 
understand how to set up a measurement solution based on reading word problems. (This is also an opportunity for 
literacy skill links with math.)

These numbers show that third grade has consistently progressed upward culminating to a 0%. For the past three 
years we have been working hard on basic math numbers and operations in K, 1st, and 2nd grades including more 
math blocks and hands-on manipulatives. 2nd graders are entering 3rd grade with a stronger math background than 
ever before. 

We see that starting in 4th grade the math score start to move downwards. We believe that this can be the result of a 
variety of factors including: language and reading skills, logic and problem solving, and fewer multiple choice options 
and more multi-step word problems.

Also, based on this data, we have developed STEM based math and science shared links teach math in real-world 
problem solving scenarios. Our Focus Fridays contain challenging problem solving scenarios that take the math 
concepts taught during the week and superimposed them on a real-world problems looping into science, social 
studies, finance, and the arts. 

Both 3rd and 4th grades showed pass rate in the high 80%. However, we are aware that the 5th grade, which was 
strong in last year's math scores, significantly slipped into a low 74%. As a result we plan to further develop the 5th 
grade Focus Friday situations and continue to reinforce those 5th grade math concepts throughout the week in small 
group work sessions. These initiatives are supported with classroom SMARTBoards, laptops, iPads, and the Mathletics 
and iXcel online programs. 

_______________________________________________________________________________ 

Teachers will continue to collaborate with the Math Coach to hone math instruction and better differentiate the 
Ready Math and GoMath! materials and their online resources. We will continue with our Math Focus Fridays that 
present students with real-life math challenges.  

An analysis of the math score met/did not meet data shows a marked difference between the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade 
scores and levels. 

P.S 159 Math Test Scores 

  Grade 4 showed the least point difference between the NYC scores and PS159 (comparing grades 3,4,5) with 

59% of the grade passing. 

  Grade 5 sustained the greatest point difference between the NYC scores and P.S. 159 (comparing grades 

3,4,5) with 46% of the grade passing. 

  Grade 3 showed a modest point difference between the NYC scores and P.S. 159 (comparing grades, 3,4,5) 

with 60% of the grade passing.  

_________ 

As a result of these scores, we are already piloting an approach with a stronger integration of place value and the use 
of multiple steps. These two areas consistently are our weakest math skills. This will be done first in 5th grade since 
we believe that the fourth graders from last year will need a more rigorous program to develop the necessary math 
analyses and writing skills.  

In addition, all grades participate in Focus Friday where for a solid ninety-minute block we provide math instruction in 
the content areas of Operations and Algebraic Thinking, and Measurement. Focus Friday also provides teachers and 
students opportunities to review the week's math concepts. 

Through common planning and weekly PLC meetings, teachers, administration, and cluster teachers discuss 
instruction methods and hear their peer's suggestions for program improvement and enhancement. PLC activities 
reflect shared practices as teachers analyze data to identify strategies for adjusting instruction as needed to 
accelerate student mastery of Common Core Learning Standards. We recognize that we have a growing population of

ELL and Special Needs students and we are endeavoring to better differentiate our math instruction to meet their 
individual needs and accommodate their particular learning styles. 

The data collected from assessments is routinely analyzed in grade conferences and team meetings. We predict that 
our adherence to maintaining collaboration on data-driven program execution will drive steady increases in both 
formative and summative math assessments. Collective and collaborative decisions coming from this data collection 
and analysis make us confident that we will see an increase in student math skills and student confidence. 
Administration continues to monitor and provides timely feedback. 

Our data acquisition with the GoMath! on-line assessment program is now being used throughout the grades. 
Classrooms still have limited devices for students but teachers have Chromebooks or tablets. Our goal is to acquire 
more devices so all students can take the GoMath! on-line assessments. Teachers can retrieve and manipulate that 
data for instruction modifications and differentiation, as well as PLC collaboration. We recognize that this is a slow 
process but we have the vision to see where we want to go in the upcoming two years. 

We have also implemented a pilot Snap-It! program in Grade 2. Each classroom has been fitted with student tablets 
which consolidate math and reading assessment and assessment data. Continuation of this project and roll out to 
other grades is contingent on budgetary funding. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
We anticipate by June 2018, our NYS mathematics test results will show a 10% increase from the 2017-2018 
measurement and operations scores across the testing grades because of collaborative sharing of math data between 
grades and grade-level groups. The data will drive the instruction for all grades.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
Progress will be monitored and disseminated by the Math Coach and Lead Teachers at each benchmark in the 
GoMath! program. Student math assessments utilize GoMath! assessments which lets us better track individual 
student progress in math skills. Having a more comprehensive assessment analyses gives us real-time data on student 
growth and a real-time identification of critical next steps for individuals, classes, and grades. (At this time, limited 
classroom devices prohibits students taking online assessments.) Administration continues to monitor and provide 
timely feedback. 

Mid-year analysis of GoMath! data continues to drive targeted instructional strategies with our under-performing 
students. This will be measured by a 10% growth in domains: Numbers and Operations, Fractions, and Measurement 
and Data. 

In addition, modifications made to lesson plans, as a result of GoMath and other resources, such as Mathletics* and 
iXCEL, helps us address the component of (3c.) Student Engagement. Reports generated from the GoMath! resources 
are used to track the time students spend online during non-school hours.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our school fosters an environment that encourages and develops the leader in all our teachers and staff. Individuals 
who have drive and willingness to grow, develop, and share their expertise are given platforms and programs where 
they can contribute to their professional growth and the academic success of the students. We believe that when 
individuals are recognized they are gratified and more ensconced in their success and that of the school. Teachers are 
encouraged to take on responsibilities in Professional Learning Committees, technology, and the arts.  

Research has shown that in order to create and sustain a great organization school leaders must engage in the 
ongoing building of capacity and creativity throughout their school. No longer is it sufficient or appropriate to 
concentrate leadership among the administration, but rather leaders must be groomed, supported and sometimes 
encouraged from other areas to take leadership roles. Our Administration leads by example and nurtures the 
professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support 
that drives student achievement.  

School leaders and staff constantly communicate expectations for high levels of shared accountability for staff and 
student learning. Daily, weekly, and monthly Administration conferences with each teacher to review student data 
and approve next-steps. Coaches are also included in meetings to ascertain IEP goals are being met and content is 
correctly taught and paced. Teachers are mentored and fostered to ensure that all their social and emotional needs 
are also being met. 

All staff members communicate and partner with families to support all students in meeting college and career 
readiness expectations through weekly meetings, progress reports, and parent conferences.   

Overall, we have been effective at helping teachers develop and grow in their profession as evidenced by the increase 
in Effective and Highly Effective ratings. This year has been a dynamic and exciting time where all pieces of our school 
pulled together and created initiatives and events which demonstrated a strong partnership between school, 
students, and families. At our school, everyone is encouraged to take on leadership positions in all areas that will 
positively impact our school's success. Teachers have been engaged in morning tutorials, clubs, sports and the arts.  

The School Leadership Team responsibilities include:  

  Understanding school operations and organization. 
  Understanding academic programs and goals - review assessment data, identified trends, discussion of 

strengths and weaknesses. Areas, where family support can help academic and social achievements, are 
identified with timed Next Steps.  
Identifying areas to improve - our "New Ideas Exchange Forum" where one new idea for improvement is 
voted on and implemented for the upcoming month.

Monthly meetings are all about understanding the school's different academic programs and goals, and planning 
better family support and outreach to better achieve those academic goals. This year's goal is to have more 
informational events to pull in families, establish strong relationships, and strengthen family involvement with the 
school. For example, this year we hosted: 

Science Night where 4th grade families were provided test prep resources and also did science,  

 
  Computer Skills where adults were given basic computer skills training. 
  Math Fun where parents and students learned about our online math resources. 
  Reading Night where families got to read together and left with book totes. 
 

Literacy Program where families learned about our literacy program online resources. 

Our PTA continues dynamic and fun programs to bring more families into partnership with our school. They have 
already conducted Family Reading Night, Carnival Day, Movie Night, and health and nutrition programs. Our Super 
Hero Dad event brought over fifty dads into our school for a tasty breakfast and superhero mask building. Activities 
such as this foster our initiatives for stronger community outreach and are now the foundation of our school 
leadership initiatives. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of all teachers will show a one level increase in 3.d Danielson assessment as a result of being active 
participants in a Professional Learning Committee action research test question based on refining instruction and 
infusing math in all content areas.

How  will  your  school  engage  parents/families  and  support  their  understanding  of  Effective  School  Leadership  and 
strategies  to  promote  parent  leadership  and  engagement  in  order  to  support  their  children  at  home?  Include  the 
timeline and identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
Our school School Leadership Team meets monthly and discusses school curriculum programs and how school and 
families can work together. SLT works with the CEP to understand our teaching goals and what is needed to ensure 
their achievement. 

PS159 offers a variety of ways families and caretakers know and understand our academic and social educational 
strategies 

1. Monthly PTA meetings - Administration, PTA staff, and Coaches present "state-of-the-union" updates and program 
overviews. 

2. Tuesday Parent Meetings - Teachers and administration review with individual parents resources and means for a 
strong family understanding of instructional strategies, issues, and strengths. 

3. Parent Coordinator - conducts monthly outreach and parent/caretaker seminars where the school's goals are 
explained, and their input requested. 

4. School Leadership Team - monthly members cross-pollinate information, develop mutual strategies, and ways to 
disseminate program and school information quickly and clearly to all students and their families.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

They have already conducted Family Reading Night, Carnival Day, Movie Night, and health and nutrition programs.  

The 2016-2017 School Quality Guide rated 3.30 which matches those score for the district and city.  

95% of parents said that the school staff regularly communicates with them about how they can help their child learn. 
85% of parents are working with the school and feel involved in their children's education. 

We received a 4.14 Trust rating which is also over the district and city scores. 

We are encouraged with our 6% increase and will continue with our academic and arts programs and PTA events that 
are drawing more families and caretakers into the school. This is evidence in our newly staffed dynamic PTA and event 
parent volunteer teams. It is still a challenge to bring families and caretakers into the school for PTA meetings, both 
during the day and night.  

We continue to work to develop strong partnerships and high expectations among staff and families that contribute 
to each student's progress and achievements. 

1.  Staff members conduct workshops for families, host a monthly Open House and provide families with 

Monthly Progress reports about their children’s progress in meeting learning targets and our academic and 
behavioral expectations for their children.  

2.  Tuesday afternoons are designated for parent conferences and/or as scheduled time for teachers to use to 

phone and e-mail parents/guardians. This family outreach enables parents to regularly visit the school to 
meet with teachers and administration.  

3.  PTA programs and initiatives are showing better outreach success with the community. As our neighborhood 

populations continue shifting we recognize that there are cultural boundaries; and, we are trying to find 
alternative means for outreach to those families who do not want school involvement.  

4.  Our Parent Coordinator leads staff and families in fun and informative initiatives to increase parent 

involvement, including Family Movie Night, Science Night, Math Afternoons, Adult Education, and PTA fund-
raising activities. 
In collaboration with staff and the parent coordinator, parents who are Learning Leaders, partner with the 
school, offering parent-led workshops on topics such as Common Core Standards, strategies for helping 
children in reading and math and use of GoMath!, Mathletics, and Reading Wonders online resources to 
support learning at home. 
In response to our growing Special Needs students, our PTA has conducted family workshops on Autism and 
ADHD. Parent responses have been very positive and we will draw in professionals for additional workshops. 

5. 

6. 

7.  This year we started monthly Reading, Science, Math, and Computer adult programs. Our goal is to give 

parents and caretakers hands-on computer time with our math and reading programs. This translates to more 
adult involvement with the programs at home which supports the children's learning. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

We also recognize the power of student art programs as a draw for parent involvement and increased event 
attendance. Parents have strongly encouraged and supported the arts curriculum and we've incorporated the arts in 
most CORE subject areas (STEAM), including science and social studies.  

Our parent attendance is extremely positive and since see their children perform is such a draw we continue to find 
monies for our Theatre, Dance, Art and Music programs. PS 159 place strong value and commitment to the arts and 
student engagement in the arts has been paramount since the programs also address our mandate for engaging all 
children in multiple venues. Through grants, Title III funding, Parent Teacher Association programs, and outside arts 
program funds, our Arts curriculum has been enhanced and expanded for all students. To better celebrate the Bengali 
students, who now are one third of our student population, we plan on creating more Bengali cultural events in 
partnership with families and friends. 

Despite budgetary constraints, we have leveraged partnerships and grant opportunities to introduce a variety of 
visual and performance programs including Class Act (theater) and Pitkin Prancers (Dance). We expanded programs 
for those students with social/emotional needs to include Respect-4-All, Mutt-i-grees (North Shore Animal League and 
Cesar Milan), Coding, Character Education, Boy's Basketball, Girl's Softball League, and No-Bullying Here!  

Our Guidance Counselor has implemented a variety of programs that are fun, educational, and reinforce our 
commitment to making college and career ready citizens.  

Through grants from DonorsChoose.org most teachers now have classroom iPads, Chromebooks, and smart devices 
for enhanced and differentiated instructional practices that can remotely link our students to museums and art 
opportunities. We are also planning the addition of technology-based morning and afternoon student activities and 
clubs and music field trips.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
 

We will continue to offer arts experiences and other extra-curricular activities and programs by 20% so that by June 
2019 there will be a 30% increase in parents responding "Strongly Agree" to the prompt "My child's school offers a wide 
enough variety of courses, extra-curricular activities, and services to keep my child interested in school", as measured 
by the New York City Survey.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 159K, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

P.S. 159K will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● Provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● Host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act; 

● Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., Tuesday afternoons, quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as 
meetings in the morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other 
initiatives of the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● Conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Events where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

 Language Instruction Education Programs funded under Title III  help LEP students attain 
English proficiency while meeting Common Core Learning Standards. Teachers will use both 
English and the student's native language as support. The program is designed to include the 
participation of ELLs and English proficient students in a model that supports language 
instruction. This model will allow ELLs and  to benefit from small group instruction, buddy 
work and tutorial sessions with partners who speak the English language. The use of this model 
will not only foster improved instruction but also support cultural understanding and tolerance of 
all members of the school community. The programs implemented under Title III will enhance 
and further support ELL programs required under CR Part 154. The Title III program will 
include two components; After School Program and the Parent/Adult Education Program. 
After School Program for ELLs 
               The After–School Program starts in mid-October, it will have four teachers servicing 
three groups of ELLs and former ELL students. The tentative dates for the program would be 
from November to January and session 2 will be from February until May, on Wednesday and 
Thursday from 2:45pm to 4:45pm (2 hours).  The groups will be organized by grade (3rd–5th 
grade) to facilitate grade specific content instruction. Six Common Branch teachers will have 50 
to 80 ELLs, Former-ELLs and Non-ELL students in total divided into six classes.  Two 
ESL/Bilingual teachers will have an ELL-only group students that need to work on specific 
language acquisition skills. 
               The students will work with the teacher to receive support in content areas such as 
ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies common core curriculum.  The program will support 
English language development in listening, speaking, reading and writing and facilitate high 
quality instruction that is content specific for each grade. In addition, students will have an 
opportunity to develop test-taking strategies that will support their performance in standardized 
tests.  The teachers will concentrate the work/instruction in the content curriculum for the grade 
by reinforcing vocabulary, reading strategies and reviewing different genres in writing. The 
teachers will facilitate technology-based instruction using a Smart Board technology and laptops 
purchased with Title III and Title I funds. This will allow teachers to navigate Internet sites to 
explore topics in Science and Social Studies while integrating reading comprehension skills at 
the same time.  Teachers will be able to enhance instruction through the use of visuals that will 
further students' understanding.  This will also support language development through UDL. 
               Materials purchased will be used in both extended learning opportunities provided in 
the program including the Oxford Dictionary for the Content Areas, Books on Tape and other 
texts for Math and Science that will be purchased with other school funds for this 
program.  Teachers will use two computers, the Smart–Board, iPads and Books on Tape 
purchased with Title III and Title I funds.  New-Comers, SIFE and SpEd ELL students will also 
use laptops. NYSLAT and NYSITELL  prepration kits were also purchased  and will be used to 
support students in becoming familiar with the test structure and expecations.

    Teachers who service ELLs, SIFE students or transitional bilingual students will be trained by 
Staff Developers during  Professional Development planning meetings. Training sessions will 
focus on Title III program goals. Teachers will learn to implement specific strategies to work 
with ELLs during the academic school day and in the  After School Program.  In addition, 
General Education will also be receiving Professional Development every Monday 
afternoon.   Through the use of multiple-entry points and differentiation, teacher will work 
towards closing the achievement gap and improve overall reading and mathematical 
comprehension skills.  Teachers will participate in Smart Board training to learn to  use the 
instructional features offered by  this technology.    In addition, they will participate in 
Professional Development sessions facilitated by the Assistant Principals, the ESL teacher and 
the Coaches/Teacher Specialist.  
Professional Development opportunities consist of but are not limited to: 
•             Language Acquisition (NYSRBRN from NYU) 
•             Dance Program & P.D. 2 days x week all students including ELLs Grades 2-5 
•             Wonders program PDs (2-3 weeks facilitated by staff experts) 
•             ELA standards and their alignment to core curriculum (NYSRBRN from NYU) 
•             Universal Design for Learning (UDL)          (Assistant Principals) 
•             Using the Smart Board                                  (Professional Developers from TEQ)

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
           In addition, a variety of workshops will be conducted to inform parents about school 
expectations, responsibilities, strategies and resources that will help them assist their child(ren). 
Workshops will focus on ideas to help their children succeed and meet the expectations of the 
grade their child(ren) are currently in.  
           All forms of communication to parents in additional to Report Cards will be available in 
English, Spanish, and Bengali using the DOE & State website.  When no translation is available 
from the DOE, we have fluent staff members that can translate the information to parents or 
guardians. 
         In addition to ENL for Adults & Computer class, additional workshops will be offered, but 
will not be paid with Title III funds.    Meetings will be coordinated in collaboration with our 
Parent Liaison.  Parents will have opportunities to suggest topics they would like to discuss or 
learn more information about.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The Diagnostic Reading Assessment (DRA) is used on all grades level to assess students' literacy levels. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The teachers administer the DRA. The Data Specialist creates and distributes growth charts as data support.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Success of the program is evaluated by extensive data analyses.  The AMAO tool allows us to see, not only how our ELLs are 
performing, but also how they are progressing in comparison to the non ELLs.  Data is collected by teachers in the classrooms

are used to drive differentiated instruction strategies.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Team meetings are an important part of curriculum planning.  All teachers gather by grade and plan according to 
the summative data gathered. ELL teachers also meet to share strategies on planning and delivering lessons   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
RTI is a collaborative effort between the teachers and Administrators. The teachers study soft data and check for 
understanding. All teachers and administrators are involved in cycles of data-driven instruction. Baseline assessments, pre-
tests, running-records, end of unit assessments, as well as teacher collected data are analyzed. At team meetings common 
misconceptions are identified and targeted through corrective instruction and appropriate intervention.  RTI groups are 
formed based on DRA scores, state exam results, and teacher soft data. Students who are receiving RTI are doing so using 
research-based programs that allow the development and practice of reading and language skills. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The analyzed data shows, across grades, that students make quicker progress in speaking and listening than they do in reading 
and writing. This correlates with the finding that students take longer to acquire the academic language than the social 
language.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Analyzing data (summative and formative) allows the school to make, not only instructional decisions, but also as a tool for 
program placement.  Some ELL students, for instance, may be placed in the Challenge Class (Gifted) or, if the Self-Contained 
ELL class is full, in a "spill-over" class with high performing students.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

There is a freestanding ENL program on each grade level. Most of the students on each grade level are grouped in one 
class.  An ENL teacher gives four periods (1 unit) of integrated ENL in ELA and pulls out for additional four periods of 
standalone ENL, two grade bands at the same time for those students receiving two units.  No more than two grade 
bands are pulled at the same time (i.e. K-1, 4-5).  During the integrated periods all proficiency levels are served at the 
same time, but the co-teaching and common planning allow for grouping and differentiated instruction. Only the 
students who receive two units are pulled out of class for one unit of the two mandated units.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Planning the TBE program instruction for ELLs is done by the Bilingual teacher. The content areas are taught in Bengali 
75% of the time and 25% of the time in English using ENL strategies and supported by the native language.     

c.  DL program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The ENL Coordinator and the Assistant Principal work together to create the schedule with the appropriate amount of minutes 
to which each child is eligible. The principal reviews and approves the schedule.  The STARS coordinator also ensures that the 
minutes add up to the mandated minutes. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In the freestanding ENL program, the ENL teacher gives four periods (1unit) of integrated ENL in ELA and pulls out for 
additional four periods of standalone ENL, two grade bands at the same time for those students receiving two units.  No more 
than two grade bands are pulled at the same time (i.e. K-1, 2-3).  
In the Bengali TBE Program students are receiving one period on NLA a day.  All content area subjects are taught in English and 
are supported by the NL. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

n/a 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Like all ELLs, SIFE students are given the mandated ENL units. In addition, instruction is differentiated for them in all subjects in 
a way that allows them to bridge the academic gap.  For example, through the use of technology, activities are tailored 
specifically to their needs and their progress is assessed. 
 
There is an extensive use of visual aids and hands-on activities.  When possible we also provide students with one-on-one aid 
within a specific subject to assist them.  SIFE students are also highly encouraged to attend the ELLs' after-school program. 
Many of our ELL population are Newcomers. Newcomers are given the mandated ENL units, taking into consideration their 
prior knowledge and proficiency in the native language. When possible, the students are placed with a teacher that speaks the 
native language and can use it to supplement the learning. Students are also paired with other students who speak their native 
language so they take part in group discussions as well as having role models as they progress in their acquisition of the target 
language.  Teachers use scaffolding techniques throughout the day and in all subjects areas to reinforce and foster 
comprehension. The use of the leveled libraries as well as the libraries on the native language is also a common 
practice.  Newcomers at the 3rd grade level and up are encouraged to take part in the ELL’s after-school program. 
We have many students  in the Developing level. A large amount of these students receive additional services to support their 
academic performance, which, according to the data, consists of lower scores on the writing component strand on the 
NYSESLAT.  This low writing ability is targeted in our after-school and Saturday academy programs.  We also provide additional 
support staff for individualized instruction and support.  
We do not have Long Term ELLs this year.     
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELLs who are also SWD are serviced according to their IEP plans. All teachers who service those students review their IEPs and 
work to accomplish the specific IEP instructional goals. Students are placed in classes according to the IEPs and receive 
additional services such as Speech, PT, and/OT.  All curricula used is Common Core aligned (Wonders, GoMath) and technology 
is used throughout to support learning.  All our classes are equipped with SMARTBoards, computers and mobile laptop labs.     

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELL-SWD are serviced with accordance to the IEP. However, ELL-SWD maybe pulled out with the rest of the ELLs for standalone 
ENL services. Also our ELL-SWD interact with the general population at activities such as library, computers, gym, lunch 
periods, and gathering at the auditorium.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 
-           Afterschool programs for ELLs supporting both ELA and Math for testing grades-           Afterschool clubs-           Extended 
day - for extra support in ELA and Math-           2 Spanish-speaking paraprofessionals - for students with IEPs-           3 Bengali -
speaking paraprofessionals - for students with IEPs-           4 Spanish-speaking teachers - 
-           2 Bengali-speaking teachers --           S.A.V.E room-           Hearing teacher-           School psychologist-           IEP 
teacher-           Family assistant-           Guidance counselor-           Resource room-           Occupational therapy-           Speech 
Therapy-           Nurse 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are continuing to open the Bengali TBE program .  This year, 2018-2019 we have opened a Kindergarten TBE-
Bengali program. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

The Dual Language Spanish for second grade was closed due to low ELL numbers. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are included in all activities. All communication is sent home in English, as well as Spanish and Bengali. On Tuesdays, 
parents are also called and are engaged in teacher meetings that provide student progress in specific areas.  General school 
activities that are specific to the needs or interest of their child are also offered.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All our classes are equipped with SMARTBoards with computers.  There are also mobile laptop labs.  In addition, there is are 
two Computer Labs for Apple and Windows. The students use a variety of educational programs:   
ELA: Achieve3000, 
Wonders for grades K-2,  
ReadyGen for grades 3-5, 
Epic Reading (which are all supported in Spanish.)  
Math:  GoMath, iXel, Mathletics (printed and online resources and hands-on manipulatives) 
Science - Harcourt Science, NY edition, and FOSS Science program.  Now we are part of the STEM program 
Social Studies - Social Studies NY NYC, Harcourt 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In the TBE Bengali is used to support the learning in the target language, according to the allocation policy.In ENL native 
language is used by the teacher if she/he speaks the language to support. It is also used by students to assist each other.In all 
programs students are encouraged to use dictionaries and glossaries. Classroom have books in native language, as well.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
ELLs are placed in grade level according to their age or grade.  They receive services according to their proficiency level. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72 

 

 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Both new and existing parents are invited to PS 159 in June or September.  The parents meet the teachers who give an 
overview of the curriculum that their child will be learning.  The parents receive a package containing handouts to practice 
English, literacy, and math with their children, maps of the neighborhood, a reading list linked with RISS and museum 
schedules. The Assistant Principal, Ms. Grant, gives a brief welcome and presentation.  Participating staff includes the Principal, 
Family Assistant, and Parent Coordinator.  She also invites organizations like the Brooklyn Public Library that gives 
presentations about Early Literacy and language acquisition.  Families are offered refreshments and free books for small 
children.    
 
New students that enroll later in the year are afforded the opportunity to meet with the teacher to talk about rules, 
expectations, and curriculum during Open House.  Families also meet with the ELL Coordinator and teacher to talk about 
Program Choices and their child’s proficiency level. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
            Teachers involved will be trained by our school staff developers during the professional development planning 
meetings. Training sessions will focus on Title III program goals. Teachers will learn to implement specific strategies to work 
with ELLs during the Saturday Program and After School. Teachers participate in SMARTBoard training to learn how to fully use 
all the instructional features that this technology offers to teachers and students. In addition, they participate in 
Professional Development sessions facilitated by the Assistant Principal, the ESL teacher and the Coaches/Teacher Specialist. 
Other Professional Development includes the ELL and General Education teachers provided every Monday at the school free or 
paid by other school funds.

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The Guidance Counselor is available to parents and students, including ELLs with any help they need in choosing a middle-
school.  The Guidance Counselor also organizes a Career Day for the fifth graders, including ELLs where community leaders and 
workers talk to them about their careers. 
Teachers meet with the ENL Coordinator to learn instructional strategies, get updates on policy changes, review student 
progress, and other items related to provide ELL the supports they need to acquire the necessary literacy skills.  We have 
agendas, attendance sheets, and evaluation forms for these sessions for record keeping purposes. 
 
The teachers also participate in Professional Development offered by outside organizations and Central NYC DOE staff.  They 
are required to provide an agenda from these workshops and to turnkey the information they attain with their colleagues.  As 
often as possible we provide in-service training to all personnel providing instruction or other services to such students in 
order to enhance, understand and appreciate students' native languages and cultures and their ability to provide appropriate 
instructional and support services. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Letters about the levels of proficiency are sent home in the parents’ home language. These letters may be the Continuing 
entitlement, transition, non-entitlement or entitlement letters.  The ENL Coordinator are always available to answer any 
questions  the parents may have (translations are always available).  In addition, the ENL Coordinator and ENL teacher usually 
holds an informational meeting for parents of ELLs and Former ELLs an hour before the Open House, and Parent Teacher 
conferences . The principal, the PTA and the parent coordinator are invited to these meetings.   
Tuesdays afternoons are reserved for parent to engage in conversations with the teacher/s about their child's 
progress.  Teachers also may call home on Tuesday afternoon to report  the student's progress.  Finally, there's an annual 
meeting held in May or June to report their final progress report.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

a.   Letters translated in Bengali and Spanish are sent home to let parents know about meetings requested regarding their 
children.  Attendance is taken and kept on file.  Teachers keep a record of any personal communication with a parent 
regarding their child; if translation is needed, certain staff is always available to aid them with interpretation.b. Meetings and 
workshops are done and parents are invited via letter.  Communications from the PTA have translations on 
special occasions.  When meetings are for parents of ELLs the letters are translated in Bengali and Spanish.  The school has in-
house staff to translate during PTA, school and workshop meetings and well as phone calls made to parents regarding personal 
matters with their child.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dr. Monica J. Duncan, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

When a child is admitted to our school a Parent/Guardian Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) is required 
to be filled out, parent and child is interviewed so that our school has appropriate information about the language 
spoken at home. This data helps the school to service parents and ensure that all parents are provided with 
appropriate and timely information in a language they can understand. The "Blue Cards" (emergency Contact) 
also have information about the language preference of the parent. For parents of ELLs, we also use the Parent 
Survey and Program Selection Form to find the language preference. Also, the Elementary School Cumulative 
Record has the parent's home language. To easily access the home languages of the school, an ATS report is ran.

the most

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

19K159 will fulfill Section VII of Chancellor’s Regulations A-663 regarding parental notification for translation and 
interpretation services: 

 

• 19K159 will provide each parent whose primary language is a covered language (i.e. Bengali, Spanish) and who 
requires language assistance services with written notification of their rights regarding translation and interpretation 
services in the appropriate covered languages, and instructions on how to obtain such services 

• 19K159 posts in a conspicuous location near the primary entrance to our school a sign in each of the covered 
languages indicating the office where a copy of such written notification can be obtained 

• 19K159 school’s safety plan contains procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language assistance services 
are not prevented from reaching the school’s administrative offices solely due to language barriers.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          84 

 

• If our school has more than 10 % of parents speaking a language which is neither English or a covered language, 
then we would ask for translations and interpretation services from the Translation and interpretation Unit at the 
Department of Education. 

• The Department’s website provides information in each of the covered languages concerning the rights of parents 
to translation and interpretation services and how to access such services. This information is made available to 
parents, usually by in-house staff 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The school and the LAC provides translations that are available on the DOE website and/or the NYS website and/or 
the Engage NY website. The school also provides: the Parents' Bill of Rights, Guides to Language Access, Language ID's 
at the security desk and Main Office, Welcome poster 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

After workshops and meetings surveys may be provided. The school uses the Parent Survey from the city to find the 
highlights of the school and what the school needs to work on as well.
