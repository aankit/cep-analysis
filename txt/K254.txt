Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our philosophy remains as “doing what is right for children”. P.S 254 strives to provide all students with a secure, 
nurturing environment in which they can grow academically and socially. We are dedicated to establishing high 
academic standards, as well as an appreciation of the cultural diversity of our school community. Parents, teachers, 
and supervisors work together with the larger community to enable our children to excel and to become life long 
learners. Our goal is to support our students on the road to becoming caring and productive citizens.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS 254 is a high performing school with a register of 802 students. Our school consists of general education with an 
enrichment population, students with disabilities, and English Language Learners for the elementary grades. P.S 254 
has a growing population of ENL students and is currently has 2 self contained ENL classes as well as three push in 
teachers to support the needs of 220 ENL students 

 

We incorporate the CCLS and personal and academic behaviors into all areas of our curriculum. We believe in 
developing our students to be cognitively engaged both in and out of the classroom. We encourage students to make 
decisions independently as we play a vital role in preparing our students to be college and career ready. Technology is 
at the forefront of students’ education. We have been working to obtain the highest quality technology equipment in 
every classroom as well as providing professional development to enhance our technology/STEM goals. Technology is 
being integrated throughout the instructional day . Education is very fluid and our highly effective teachers are always 
learning and sharing new ideas and continuously maintaining rigorous instruction. Through the ADVANCE system, 
school leaders monitor teacher growth and provide maximum opportunities for professional learning and enrichment.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

P.S 254 has a growing population of ENL students. At current time we service 220 ELL students. Professional 
Development will be designed to provide all teachers with strategies to improve instruction: Total Physical Response, 
Use of Pictures, vocabulary work etc. These strategies will be implemented in lessons and unit plans to better serve 
student needs. In addition, P.S 254 is moving toward the integrated ENL model beginning in the Kindergarten grade. It 
is our goal to train teachers to use strategies and scaffolds to best support our ENL populations needs in every 
classroom. Units will be updated to include these additional supports. In addition, PS 254 is identify writing across the 
content areas as an area for targeted development across the grades and in turn supporting the needs of our ENL 
students. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Upon reflection, based on the Framework for Great Schools, we have demonstrated progress in the 2018-2019 school 
year in building Trust. . Also upon continued reflection and from results of our last Quality Review, our areas of focus 
lie in improving rigorous instruction throughout all content areas. While teachers use data to design differentiated 
instruction in lessons and units it was not seen across all content areas. A particular area of focus will be on using 
formative assessment to identify the needs of our students. This data will be utilized to create rigorous targeted 
instruction. We will also be utilizing Scantron Performance Series to gain further data on our students to enhance 
instruction. In addition, although we continuously obtain Strong Family and Community Ties , we will be working on 
new and innovative ways to improve our community resources to enrich the civic life of the school.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Based on all ELA and Math data including state assessments and in house benchmarks (F&P), periodic assessments, 
and PBA’s it is evident that there is a continuous need to increase the percentage of students, especially our SWD’s 
and ELLs, making at least one year’s progress in ELA. The need for increasing the rigor and critical thinking 
components of all tasks is necessary. In order to improve instruction it is necessary to improve formative assessments 
in the classroom to gain a better understanding of students strengths and weaknesses. In addition, staff and the 
instructional cabinet needs to meet regularly and systematically to review trends in data. This data will then be 
utilized to differentiate instruction to address the needs of all learners and subgroups 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will participate in professional development on formative assessment to deepen their 
understanding of student strengths and weaknesses. This data will be used to drive differentiated instruction resulting in 
a 5% increase in teacher scores of Danielson Component 3D Using Assessment in the Classroom.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other 
high-need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

Curriculum designed across all elementary grades in all core 
subjects will help challenge students’ thinking and increase 
their overall ability to critically think, necessary for college 
and career readiness. Units will include quick formative 
assessments in the classroom to help drive differentiated 
instruction to meet the needs of all learners and subgroups-

Teachers will develop rigorous tasks and units that include 
scaffolding and differentiated strategies designed for 
students with special needs and/or ELL's. The activities will 
include opportunities for students to experience productive 
struggle to improve students cognitive thinking and problem 
solving skills. The math and reading/writing component of 
units will include explicit instruction with differentiation and 
special attention to vocabulary and usage, making it 
accessible to students with limited language skills. Teachers 
will focus on writing across the content areas and provide 
supports and scaffolds necessary to assist the needs of our 
ENL students 

Use of technology to infuse rigor in an interactive way to 
target reading and writing strategies. This includes the Path 
Blazers software curriculum to help students build their 
ELA/Math Skills for students that are struggling. 

Interim assessment testing (Performance Series) will be 
utilized to track student progrees. Based on all ELA and 
Math data including state assessments and in house 
benchmarks (F&P), periodic assessments, and PBA’s it is 
evident that there is a continuous need to increase the 
percentage of students, especially our SWD’s and ELLs, in 
making at least one year’s progress in ELA. The need for 
increasing the rigor and critical thinking components of all 
tasks is necessary. In addition, the instructional cabinet

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Data of the school indicates that while students achieve at a high level however instruction is not differentiated to 
meet all individual groups in all content areas. In addition students need to be given more time to struggle, make 
mistakes and learn on their own. In order to differentiate and challenge students effectively it is necessary to have 
ongoing assessment. Teachers will be trained in incorporating formative assessments to measure student 
understanding. This data in turn will be utilized for grouping and creating rigorous targeted instruction. Teachers 
identified Professional Development as an area that needs improvement in the Learning Survey. An initial survey will 
be done to have teachers input on Professional Development and focus on key areas of Formative Assessment, 
Productive Struggle, ENL Strategies and Questioning and Discussion. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will participate in Professional learning Cycles (PLC) focusing on Formative Assessment, , 
ENL Strategies, and Questioning and Discussion resulting in a 5% of teachers increasing MOTP score in Component 3B.

Grades will form inquiry teams to analyze study work to identify 
the differentiation needs for the different groups of students. 
Grade teams will work together in creating Formative 
Assessments to be in embedded in Unit Plans. 

Administration will complete low inference formal and informal 
observations with a focus on formative assessment and 
differentiation for all students. Through Advance administration 
will identify teachers with strength in using scaffolding and 
differentiated strategies. Model classrooms will be set up for 
inter-visitation and learning walks. 

Teams will analyze student outcomes based on the differentiated 
activities. Vertical Team meets to analyze how Formative 
Assessment is improving instruction. Administrators and select 
teachers will visit other schools in District 22 to observe how 
other schools are assessing their students. This information will

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Upon reflecting on the most recent specific ADVANCE data across all three school leaders, it is evident that although 
we have numerous highly effective teachers, there is always room for further growth and enhancements to teacher 
practices and further norming and calibrating among administration on ADVANCE is necessary to guide future 
important instructional decisions. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will participate in a minimum of 3 observations targeting Domain 3 of Danielson 
resulting in a 5% increase in the MOTP score in 3C Engagement.

completed that includes a list of teacher goals for the year 

Cabinet will meet regularly to improve calibration in 
ADVANCE and make decisions instructionaly (building 
teacher leaders as well as offering additional supports). 
Cabinet will discuss how teachers are progressing towards 
meeting their individual goals and providing opportunities 
for growth (Professional Development, Inter-visitations, 
Model Classrooms). Use of Danielson Data will track how 
teachers are improving in each of the Danielson 
Components 

At the beginning of the year teachers will identify 2 
professional goals using the MOTP as a guide. 
Administration will observe, conference and provide timely 
feedback to assist teacher in meeting their goals

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S 254 Dag Hammarskjold School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title 
I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

[School name] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Administration and ENL teachers analyze the results of the NYSESLAT using the ELL Data 
Analysis Tool (EDAT) to plan for instruction for each student based on the four modalities of 
listening, speaking, reading, and writing as well as other factors indicated by the tool (ELA and 
Math state test results, attendance, and length of ENL service.) Additionally, in-house 
assessments are updated and reviewed periodically, including but not limited to:  running records 
of individual student reading using the Fountas and Pinnell (F&P) benchmark; benchmarks in 
writing assessed with normed, standards-based rubrics for narrative, opinion, and informational 
writing pieces;  classroom-based assessments such as teacher observation and conference notes; 
and performance-based assessments aligned to the ReadyGen program. The goal of the Title III 
program is to have targeted small group instruction using differentiated instruction.  The program 
will have a fall and spring cycle to target different needs. 
The fall cycle will target students in grades 2 to 5 who are reading 3 or more levels below grade 
level according to the F&P benchmark assessment administered in May/June 2018.  Thirty 
students have been identified : 7 incoming second graders, 10 third, 8 fourth, and 5 
fifth.  Seventeen of the 30 students have been matriculated in an English Language School 
System (ELSS) for less than one year.  The students will be divided into 3 subgroups of 10 based 
on their F&P levels and not their grade level.  The program will meet Wednesdays and 
Thursdays from 2:30 to 4:00 PM for 15 consecutive sessions beginning October 10, 2018 to 
December 13, 2018. 
One goal of the program is to increase students’ independent reading levels through guided 
reading groups by developing their ability to apply strategies in authentic texts.  Teachers will 
draw these strategies from the “Fountas and Pinnell Literacy Continuum” which directly aligns 
with the F&P assessments conducted in May/June 2018 from which the data were 
drawn.  Another goal is to improve writing skills using text frames and sentence starters as 
scaffolds when responding to higher level questions related to the guided reading text.  Students 
will self-assess using “I can...” statements, exemplar writing samples, and student-generated 
rubrics.  Additionally, a digital resource, SmartyAnts, will be used to support students’ 
development in phonemic awareness, decoding, fluency, and scaffolded story-building.  The 
online program commences with a benchmark assessment that places the student in the program 
level based on results.  Teachers us the data-driven platform to further differentiate needs on a 
student-by-student basis.   
Students will be directly instructed in English by 3 ENL certified pedagogues.  Print materials 
include 6 packs of F&P leveled texts corresponding to students levels and larger format level 
texts.  All texts and the online program are resources used above and beyond what is provided 
during the day for regular instruction.   
The spring cycle will target the most at-risk third, fourth and fifth graders based on the "At-Risk 
Level Comparison" report of the EDAT.  For the 2016 administration of the NYSESLAT, 100 
per cent of the level 3 through 6 at-risk ELL students are third, fourth and fifth graders for the 
2017-18 school year as well as 43 per cent of the at-risk level 1 and 2 ELL students.  Therefore, 
these three grade levels were selected to be the focus of an afterschool program.  For grades 3 - 5 
, the summary report of the EDAT indicates 10 ELLs scored low in the writing modality, 2 in the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

 

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
reading, 1 in in listening and 2 in speaking.  By far the area of strength for these grade levels is 
the speaking modality of the NYSESLAT, as indicated by 58 ELLs in grades 3-5 scoring in high 
range.  Fifteen ELLs scored at Level 1 and 7 ELLs scored level 2 on the ELA.  Therefore, based 
on the analysis of the data, the program will focus on writing and reading instruction 
primarily.  If this trend is not supported by new data, the focus will be changed accordingly. 
Following the previous years rationale, the EDAT from the May 2017 administration of 
the  NYSESLAT will be used to select the most at-risk ENL student in September 2017, 15 per 
grade for grades 3, 4 and 5.  The program is scheduled to run for 15 sessions from 2:30 to 4:00 
PM on Wednesdays and Thursdays from January 10 to March 7, 2019.  English is the language 
of instruction.  Two dually certified TESOL/Common Branches teachers will teach the third and 
fourth grade groups and one special education teacher will provide instruction to the fifth grade 
group which has a high percentage of SPED/ELLs.  The ENL teachers will confer with the 
special education teacher to ensure ENL pedagogical techniques are incorporated into 
instruction. 
The Fountas and Pinnell Level Literacy Intervention Systems will be purchased to support the 
program.  These are supplemental and not used for regular instruction during the school 
day.  Each session will consist of a shared reading leading into a writing task based on the 
reading selection.  Teachers will conduct small group/one-on-one differentiated instruction in 
reading and/or writing, based on students' needs.  Each session will end with a partner or 
whole group share to develop listening and speaking skills.  The system consists of fiction 
and  non-fiction text sets in different genres.  Students will be provided with content-related 
word-for-word translated glossaries in their home language, as available.  The use of these tools 
will be explicitly taught at the onset of the program.   
Records will be maintained in a designated Title III binder housed in the principal's office.  Title 
III invitation letters will include an overview of the program and school specific information 
including dates, times, and dismissal procedures.  Letters will be sent home in both English and 
in the parent's preferred language according to their response on the Home Language 
Identification Survey completed at the time of admission, as available.  Parents who do not 
respond to the first invitation will be sent a second invitation as well as be contacted by phone in 
their home language, as available.  All copies of letters, second requests, and telephone logs will 
be housed in the Title III binder.  Teachers will mark daily attendance and return it to their 
supervisor at the end of each session with cumulative attendance records housed in the 
binder.  Agendas and attendance sheets for all professional development (PD) and parent 
meetings will be so maintained.

Begin description here:            
As mandated by Jose P., professional development (PD) is provided to the whole school staff, 
including teachers, paraprofessionals, and family workers.  Our ENL Teachers/Coordinator will 
continue to provide ongoing ENL PD and support during grade conferences, after school 
sessions, Professional Development times (Mondays), and on the Chancellor's Professional 
Development Days.  ENL, Common Branch, and Special Education teachers as well as 
paraprofessional attend a variety of workshops outside the building throughout the school year 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

 

Part C: Professional Development  
that target ELL populations. ENL teachers will receive ongoing PD through trainings offered by 
the network and the city department of ELLs (DELLS).  The ENL coordinator has been 
designated as the school's ambassador representing 254 at monthly network trainings.  Part of 
this PD includes a professional book club to further development.  PD is seen as a cycle of 
learning with time for application, reflection and feedback.  The feedback will be used to drive 
further PD.  
PD will positively impact the progress of ELLs by enhancing pedagogical methods that make 
content more accessible to ELLs.  With a large population of ELLs and former ELLs (FELLS), 
254 is structuring all PD to address specific needs of ELLs, either directly as the focus of the PD 
or a subfocus within a larger topic being presented.  The model for every in house training, 
whether or not it has an overarching ENL focus, is to explicitly apply learning to special 
populations (ENL, Special Ed, enrichment) and where they overlap (SPED/ELLs, ELLs in 
enrichment, etc.).  The PD model is to allow time in each session for participants to directly 
apply the objective to their own instruction.  The essential question is always "looking forward to 
my upcoming teaching, how will I apply strategy A to content B to make both content and 
language more accessible to ELLs?"  
In September 2018 a survey of the staff will be conducted to determine areas of need for PD 
for the school year.  Teachers will be asked to self-identify an area in ENL instruction to study 
and join a team based on a common topic.  The teams will meet monthly during Monday PD 
from 2:20 to 3:40 commencing October 2018.  The topics for these Professional Learning teams 
will be determined through the survey and reflection process.  One possible resource is the NYC 
Department of Education website houses video series under the educator resources section of 
DELLS covering a variety of ENL topics across content areas.  These video libraries 
offer possible topics to be covered by study groups such as 1)   Math problem solving strategies 
for ELLs  - Deborah Armitage 2)  response to intervention for ELLs - Dr. Janette 
Klingner 3)  teaching vocabulary - Kate Kinsella  3)   Challenges and opportunities in ELA - 
Timothy Shanahan.  Other study groups may chose to create a professional book study group and 
apply their learning with an inquiry model.   The survey will include multiple topics with regard 
to writing and ELLs as this is an area of focus in the Comprehensive Education Plan (CEP).  For 
example, teachers may explore using “I Can” statements and student-created rubrics in writers 
workshop. 
Monthly team learning around a central topic ensures “well-planned, ongoing events rather than 
one-day or short-term workshops and conferences.”  These PD sessions will be facilitated by 
ENL teachers, grade team leaders and administrators and are provided to all classroom teachers 
and paraprofessional, including those teaching in the Title III program, and are directly 
applicable to implementing the program effectively.  The only cost to Title III will be to 
purchase professional texts and supplies to support team learning.   
For the 2018-19 school year, PS 254 will invite 5 classroom teachers who have large ENL 
populations to participate in a professional book club for the text Core Instructional 
Routines:  Go-To Structures for Effective Literacy Teaching by Judy Dodge and Andrea 
Honigsfeld.  An administrator will facilitate 5 hourly meetings on alternating Thursdays 
beginning on October 11, 2018 at cost to Title III. 
Agendas and attendance sheets for all PD  sessions will be maintained in a binder in the 
principal's office.

 
  name of provider 
  how parents will be notified of these activities 

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
Working with the parent coordinator, it was determined that families consistently seek 
information on how to better prepare their children for state exams.  Therefore, parent workshops 
were created related to the ELA, Math, ESPET (Science), and NYSESLAT.  All parents of 
ELLs  are invited and encouraged to attend. Parents are notified in writing.  All notices are 
translated by our translation team members into parent's preferred language based on HLIS, as 
available. The parent coordinator also reaches out to parents by e-mail and school 
messenger.  Parents will be provided with strategies to help prepare their children for all tests 
and actively engage in hands-on activities with them during the workshop. All workshops will be 
held from 5:00 to 6:00 PM.  The NYSESLAT/Literacy workshop will be held in March 2019 
facilitated by 2 ENL teachers, the ELA/Math workshop will be offered in March 2019 facilitated 
by a content area teacher and the math coach, and the science workshop will be held In April 
2019 facilitated by 2 science teachers.  These classes and workshops will be conducted In 
English.  Translators will be available at all workshops at no cost to Title III. 
 PS 254 will expand the Family Literacy program for the 2018-19 school year based on high 
parent demand in 2017-2018.  The focus of the program is to invite family members to learn 
alongside their children.  Each session will focus around a topic from everyday life and a 
corresponding special place in our PS 254 community.  For example, this year families listened 
to a shared reading about the market, played a literacy game with key vocabulary and then went 
on a scavenger hunt at the local grocery store.  Families went home with books and literacy 
games about the topic. 
The program will run in 2 cycles.  The fall cycle will target kindergarten families, many of 
whom are new to the school.  Twenty to 25 families will be invited to participate.  Families will 
be split into 2 subgroups by home languages to allow for easier translations.  One group will 
attend for 4 consecutive Wednesdays from 2:30 to 4 PM, the other on Thursdays, starting on 
October 10, 2018, for a total of 8 sessions.  The spring cycle will target newcomer 
families.  Every year we matriculate approximately 20 students across grade levels who recently 
immigrated.  These families will be invited to attend 4 consecutive sessions on Thursdays from 
2:30 to 4:00 PM starting February 7, 2019.  The program will be conducted in English by an 
ENL teacher and a special education teacher.  A family worker and other translators will be 
available at no cost to Title III. 
Copies of all invitations, agendas, attendance sheets, and feedback forms will be maintained in 
the Title III binder housed in the principal's office.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
PS 254 uses multiple formative and curriculum-embedded assessments to guide instructional planning for ELLs including, but 
not limited to:  Fountas and Pinnell (F&P) Benchmark Assessment; F&P Primary Literacy Assessment;  on-demand writing pre-
assessments normed using standards-based rubrics for narrative, opinion and informational writing pieces;  individual student 
reports generated from Reading A to Z online reading program;  informal classroom-based assessments such as teacher 
observations and conference notes; and ongoing teacher-created assessments aligned to curriculum. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

ENL teachers are trained in using the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark and Primary Literacy Assessment Kit.  Data collected by 
grade level are uploaded into a database to be shared with administration, classroom teachers, ENL teachers, and other 
service providers.  ENL teachers collaborate with classroom teachers on an on-going basis as part of the Integrated model of 
ENL instruction.  ENL teachers collaborate with classroom teachers in grade level teams twice a month to further support this

effort.  All formative data are compiled in documents by grade teams and shared across the school community so all 
stakeholders have access to ongoing assessment results in real-time. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
PS 254 uses multiple summative assessments to identify baseline, progress and areas of need.  Three times per year, (F&P) 
Benchmark determines independent and instructional reading levels.  These results are interpreted using a school-wide rubric 
that deems students on, above or below state standards in correlation with their independent reading level. The results are 
also used to determine areas of need to form guided reading groups in which students receive targeted differentiated 
instruction.  In writing, performance-based assessments are given at the end of each genre unit. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  
Classroom teachers meet with the administration team to review summative data and make a plan to address 
interventions.  Teachers provide differentiated instruction/flexible grouping  to meet needs and periodically progress monitor 
to adjust instruction.  Time to plan for intervention and next steps is built into the teachers' schedules by grade level in the 
form of weekly common preps as well as Monday extended day professional development.  The progress of these targeted 
students is monitored by administration through bimonthly grade meetings.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
At P.S. 254 uses the data described above to place ELL students into flexible groups in order to differentiate instruction and to 
provide intensive academic support.  ENL and classroom teachers provide Tier 1 Instruction for ELLs within the classroom. They 
emphasize oral and written language development, build word reading and spelling skills in context. Students' fluency is 
increased by helping students read with ease, expression, and not to race through reading. Reading comprehension instruction 
is done through content are instruction. Teachers use data, including Fountas and Pinnell, performance based assessments, 
classwork, and teacher observations to identify students for RTI Tier 2 intervention.  The program runs in 6 week cycles.  At the 
end of the 6 weeks, a determination is made whether to continue or discontinue RtI services, based on individual student 
data.   
  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Multiple reports from the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT), the RLAT from ATS, and ELA and Math scale scores are used to 
evaluate and inform ELL programs.  Administration and ENL teachers analyze the results of the May 2017 NYSESLAT using the 
EDAT to plan for instruction for each student based on the four modalities of listening, speaking, reading, and writing as well as 
other factors indicated by the tool (ELA and Math state test results, attendance, and length of ENL service.)  Analysis of these 
outcomes leads to targeted small group instruction using differentiated instruction during the school day.For example,based 
on the "At-Risk Level Comparison" report of the EDAT, all of the level 3 through 6 at-risk ELL students are current third, fourth 
and fifth graders as well as 43 per cent of the at-risk level 1 and 2 ELL students.  Therefore, these three grade levels were 
selected to be the focus of The Title III afterschool program.  For grades 3 - 5 , the summary report of the EDAT indicates 10 
ELLs scored low in the writing modality, 2 in the reading, 1 in in listening and 2 in speaking.  Areas of strength for these grade 
levels indicate 40 ELLs in grades 3-5 scored high in the writing modality, 17 in reading, 6 in listening, and 58 in 
speaking.  Fifteen ELLs scored at Level 1 and 7 ELLs scored level 2 on the ELA.  Therefore, based on the analysis of the data, the 
Title III program will focus on writing and reading instruction primarily. 
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Administration, the ENL coordinator and ENL teachers meet as a team to plan.  Findings are then disseminated through 
staffwide professional development sessions, grade level meetings, and one-on-one meetings.  Adjustments are made to 
programs based on feedback.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction for ELLs in the Freestanding ENL program is is implemented through integrated and standalone ENL 
according to CR Part 154.2 regulations.  In Kindergarten students are placed homogeneously with the majority of 
EN/EM students in one class and the majority of TR/EX students in another.   Grade 1 and grade 2 have one 
heterogeneous self- contained class each.  The remaining grade 1 and 2 students and all students in grades 3 through 
5 are heterogeneously placed.  The appropriate number of integrated and standalone units are provided. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

n/a 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

n/a   

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

PS 254 ensures the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels achieved on the 
2017 NYSESLAT for all ELLs and FELLs in the freestanding ENL program.  Students at the Commanding level receive 90 minutes 
of integrated service each week in a content area..  Students at Transitional and Expanding levels receive 180 minutes of 
integrated ENL per week in the content area of ELA.  Students at Entering and Emerging levels receive 360 minutes per week 
as per CR-Part 154, 180 minutes integrated in the content area of ELA and 180 minutes standalone in explicit ENL instruction. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   There is ongoing collaboration with classroom teachers on grade standards and rubrics that are aligned with each grade 
curriculum and instruction in order to meet the instructional goals and Common Core Learning Standards. 
    --Students receive instruction in English that complements the themes and curriculum of their current grade level and 
incorporates the multicultural background of the students. 
   -- The instruction utilizes ENL strategies and methodologies (analyzing juicy sentences to build comprehension, explicit 
grammatical instruction in speaking and writing, TPR, alternate text sets, auditory discrimination, books on tapes, pictures, 
realia, dictionaries, translated glossaries, to increase targeted academic vocabulary in content areas. 
--Strategies often used for ELLs include modeling, audiovisuals, semantic mapping, graphic organizers, explicit vocabulary 
development, activating prior knowledge, scaffolding, and engaging in accountable talk.  
-- Students are paired up with other children who speak their home language to give support in content areas.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   As appropriate, ELL students are evaluated in their native language throughout the year by bilingual staff members and/or 
translation services.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

a. 

SIFE   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

6a. There are no SIFE students in our school.  However, we do have a plan in place, in the event that we may have a SIFE 
student in the future.  The student would be assessed by ENL and classroom teachers to determine the type of differentiated 
instruction  necessary to help the child progress. In addition the student would be invited to attend our Title III afterschool 
program.  They would also receive small group instruction that would utilize item analysis to target their individual needs as 
per their assessments. 
    b.-- ELLs in US schools less than three years (newcomers) are grouped by abilities for small group ENL instruction. Basic 
survival English is taught. Focus is also placed on phonics  and basic writing/reading skills. Bilingual dictionaries are used to 
support students comprehension. 
   --Students within each ELL subgroup are grouped according to their speaking, listening, reading and writing levels as per 
NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores, collaboration with classroom teacher levels and based on Fountas and Pinnell scores.  
  -- Additional support for listening and speaking provided by scaffolded instruction utilizing methodologies such as read 
alouds, think alouds, think, pair, share, etc. 
  -- A newcomer group meets during the Title III afterschool program to further instruction in language skills.   
  c. Students who have been in the program for 4-6 years, receive extension of services, and are given additional content area 
instruction. They are invited to attend our after school Title III program and are identified for support by our AIS team. The 
instructional focus is on improving comprehension and writing skills.  Students receive additional instruction in academic 
vocabulary using various materials including Best Practices in Reading, alternate text sets and Strategies for Content Area 
Reading.  ENL strategies, including TPR, linear arrays, graphic organizers, sentence frames, etc. support the academic language 
acquisition. 
 d. There are no long term ELLs currently at our school.  However, if there were long term ELLs, they would be invited to 
participate in our Title III afterscool program.   
 e. Teachers are provided with a list of 1 and 2 year FELLs, so that they can differentiate instruction for these students. These 
Former ELL students also participate in the ENL program and Title III afterschool program. They still receive testing 
modifications as per New York City Standards.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Our ELL-SWDs receive their mandated ESL services in coordination with their IEP goals. 
   --ENL instruction is provided in small groups with mainstream students. 
  -- Paraprofessionals accompany their assigned students to ENL for standalone units.. 
  -- Instruction is differentiated based on their needs, abilites and IEPs.  
  --They are invited to attend the Title III afterschool program. 
  --Special education providers, ENL teachers and classroom teachers are involved in an ongoing collaboration to match level 
specific programs geared toward the child reaching his/her particular goal.  
The following materials and programs are utilized for instruction: Alternate Text Sets, Great Leaps Reading and Math, 
Fundations, Soar to Success, Wilson, And differentiated online programs.  All materials and programs are grade and age 
appropriate.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
-ENL teachers, speech teachers and other providers meet at the beginning of the school year to organize scheduling, so that 
the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs are fully met and that the students receive all mandated services as per their IEPs.  All students 
are grouped for instruction based on their individual data.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

P.S. 254 uses individual student data for grouping for instruction, in order to meet the needs of our ELL students. We  have the 
following intervention programs in place:  RtI and Title III afterschool program.  All programs provide instruction in the content 
areas of ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies.  We use performance task based assessments in ELA, Math, Science and Social 
Studies, as well as interim and classroom assessments, which identify students who need targeted intervention programs. All 
intervention services are provided in English, with native language glossaries and dictionaries, as available. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Our school has been using two new Common Core aligned programs - Ready Gen for ELA and Go Math for Mathematics 
successfully.  We will continue to offer Title III to all ELLs and FELLs in grades 2, 3, 4 and 5.  Instruction will be aligned to the 
Common Core State Standards.     
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

n/a 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All programs at P.S. 254 are open to all students, including ELLs.  All ELL students are provided with every opportunity to grow 
academically and participate in all school programs: academic, enrichment, sports and/or the arts during school as well as after 
school.  All students, including ELLs, are invited to participate in the school Choir and the arts program. Remedial and 
accelerated programs are offered to all students, including ELLs, based on needs, as determined by assessments.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Technology is incorporated into instruction for all students, including ELLs. ENL teachers and technology clusters plan 
cooperatively to insure that technology is integrated and embedded in all content areas throughout the day. The school uses 
the LearningA-Z suite of websites.  It includes a student website for online reading and assessment.  The site offers ELA lessons 
to support ELLs at all proficiency levesl.  SmartyAnts is an online program that uses a cycle of instruction and assessment to 
support early literacy skills from letter recognition to reading at an F&P level G.  We also incorporate alternate text sets for 
ELLs to provide multiple entry points to the grade level curriculum. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Newcomers are "buddied" up with students who speak their home language, whenever possible. Students use native language 
dictionaries and glossaries throughout the year.  Seven languages are spoken by the staff of PS 254, which is very helpful in 
communicating with students and parents. Students also use websites such as "WordWorld" and computer translations as 
learning tools to support home languages. Students in grades 3-5 may take content area state exams in their native language 
per State regulations. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

We align all curriculum and instructional materials to the appropriate age and grade levels of our students.   All instruciton is 
Common Core aligned and students are grouped based on proficiency levels.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
PS 254 is singularly housed. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Each spring, we have an open house for parents of all incoming Kindergarten students, including potential ELLs. Parents 
receive information about the school and the ESL programs during this meeting and registration. Additional information is 
provided during ENL orientation and throughout the year to the parents of newly enrolled students. Newly enrolled students 
are added to all after school programming with their peer group.  All incoming as well as in-house Pre-kindergarden students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

are identified and tested using the NYSITELL (if eligible) for English language proficiency.  Each student is given a 30 minute 
appointment for the assessment and ENL teachers, the ENL family worker, and member of the translation/interpretation team 
provide an overview to the ENL program and answer any questions or address any concerns immediately.  Parents leave their 
appointment ready to return in September for the first day of school.  Additionally, Kindergarten families are invited to an 
orientation the day before school starts to 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

PS 254 does not offer language electives. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
ELL teachers attend professional development workshops provided by OELL and LOTE as well as staff development by Math 
coaches in school and network.  All staff, including classroom teachers, ENL teacher, administration, etc., participate in the 
minimum fifteen percent ENL Professional Development hours prescribed by CR Part 154.2.  These professional developments 
are dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language 
and content instruction for English Language Learners. Our ESL staff attend outside PDs appropriate for each grade and 
professional level. They do turn-key training for the school staff on writing and questioning strategies, and content area 
vocabulary.  Our tentative schedule is as follows: 
September:  ELL Identification and Placement 
October: ELL Data Analysis; Strategies for Language Aquisition  
November: Scaffolding ReadyGen to Meet the Needs of our ELLs and incorporating ESL strategies into unit planning 
December:  Scaffolding GoMath to Meet the Needs of our ELLs and addressing challenges for ELLs in other Contant areas 
January:  How to Pick Vocabulary Words to Teach and Using Graphic Organizers; strategies for comprehension and 
increasing   vocabulary helpful during writing workshop    
March: Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT: supporting ELL achievement- Oral Language unpacked, strategies to unpack text 
compexity 
April: DOK for ELLs 
June:  Fast Forward:  Planning for September 
Agendas and attendance are kept in a binder on record in the main office. 
  
2 &4  As mandated by Jose P., we provide professional development to the entire school staff, including teachers, 
paraprofessionals, administration, SBST members, etc. Our ENL Teachers/Coordinators and our Network Achievement Coach 
provide the mandatory 15%  of ENL training for general education teachers and Special Education teachers.  These professional 
developments are delivered during Professional Developments on Mondays, grade conferences, after school sessions and on 
the Chancellor's Professional Development Days. Attendance records are recorded and logged.   
--Professional Development is provided to general and special education teachers highlighting ESL strategies and 
methodologies in content areas and special attention is given to stages of language acquisition and development, 
differentiation,  scaffolding strategies, as well as cultural sensitivity.  All content area instruction is Common Core aligned. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

--Workshop topics to be covered: ENL Standards and Approaches to ENL Instruction; Levels of English Literacy development 
and language analysis; Test taking strategies; Developing Reading and Writing Proficiency; Model lessons (push-in), ELL 
Mathematics and Content area vocabulary; Instructional strategies  and methodologies for entering (newcommer) level ELLs .  
       
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
PS 254 meets the professional development (PD) requirements as per CR Part 154.2 through a variety of PD activities.  For the 
2017-2018 school year, administration has contracted with the Center for Integrated Teacher Education (CITE) to provide ELL-
specific high quality staff and curriculum development to all teachers.  Additionally, our ENL Teachers/Coordinator will 
continue to provide ongoing ENL PD and support during grade conferences, PD sessions during extended day (Mondays), on 
Chancellor's PD days, and one-on-one.  All teachers have opportunities to attend PD workshops outside the building 
throughout the school year that target ELL populations. PDs offered by the Brooklyn South Borough Field Support Center 
(BFSC) and the NYCDOE Office of ELLs (DELLS) are empahasized.  The ENL coordinator has been designated as the school's ENL 
Ambassador representing 254 at monthly trainings through the BFSC.  Part of this PD includes a professional book club to 
further development.  The ambassador turn-keys the monthly training to the full staff at the next full staff PD session.  All 
teachers have opportunities to attend PD workshops outside the building throughout the school year that target ELL 
populations. PDs offered by the Brooklyn South Borough Field Support Center (BFSC) and the NYCDOE Office of ELLs (DELLS) 
are empahasized.  
 
With a large population of ELLs and former ELLs (FELLS), 254 is structuring all PD to address specific needs of ELLs, either 
directly as the focus of the PD or a subfocus within a larger topic being presented.  For trainings with an overarching ENL focus, 
such as "How to incorporate ENL strategies into unit planning,"  the model is to allow time in each session for participants to 
directly apply the objective to their own instruction.  The essential question is "looking forward to your upcoming teaching, 
how will you apply stratefy A to content B to make both content and language more accessible to ELLs?"  All agendas, 
attendance sheets and feedback forms will be housed in the PD binder in the principal's office. 
old--Staff receives professional development to support ELLs as they transition to middle school from our Guidance Counselor, 
Parent Coordinator and Assistant Principal.  Staff is invited to attend Family Open Houses which provide middle school 
information.   In addition, bilingual staff and translation services are available to assist staff in communicating with the 
families.  ENL teachers also receive training from the SBST and are available to answer any questions.   
Please see number 2 above    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
PS 254 provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals, progress, assessment results and needs by 
individual appointments on Tuesdays from 2:20 to 3:00 PM.  Members of the in-house translation and interpretation team are 
available to during this time frame.  Teachers can also access the NYCDOE  Translation and Interpretation Unit for over-the-
phone services in real-time. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Our school highly values parent and community involvement, and takes active steps to ensure that both are part of the 
school's culture.  All parents, including the parents of ELL students, are invited to attend all school events and 
meetings.  Translators and interpreters are available at school events.  The Parent Association is very active in many 
fundraising activities for our school: Book Fair, Holiday Boutique, Mother's Day Plant Sale, Annual dance, Octoberfest , 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

Winter/Spring Concert, etc.  ELL parents are active volunteers in our school community, especially at the above events. 
-- The Parent Coordinator has ongoing workshops for Kindergarten and Middle school parents, CPR for parents, as well as 
other workshops throughout the year. She provides community resources and information (for free or at low cost) to cultural 
programs for all the parents including the ELL parents.  
--Through Title III funding, we offer orientation sessions and content area workshops for parents throughout the school year.  
-- Test preparation workshops before the ELA, Math, Science, and NYSESLAT tests. 
--ENL and Technology classes.   
--As per the new ELL Policy and Reference Guide for 2017-18, our school will provide individual meetings with parents during 
Parent Engagement time on Tuesdays and other mutually agreeable times throughout the year. Parents will be informed about 
the goals of the program, language development progress of their children, language proficiency assessment results, and 
language development needs in all content areas. Interpreters are provided at all school events and meetings. 
Attendance records and agendas from all meetings, in person meetings, orientation, Technology/ENL classes, ELA/Math, 
Science,  and NYSESLAT workshops are housed in the ENL office. Records of Parent/Teacher Conferences are kept in the main 
office.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

PS 254 culls data from multiple sources to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 
and oral communication. At the time of registration, every parent has a one-on-one meeting with an English as a 
New Language (ENL) teacher to completes a Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS). On Part III of the HLIS, 
parents respond to two questions regarding how the Department of Education can communicate with them in the 
language of their choice: 1. In what language would you like to receive written information from the school? 2. In 
what language would you prefer to communicate orally with school staff? The RAPL report in ATS consolidates all 
of this information. Additionally, the ATS report RPOB indicates all of the Home Language for the entire school 
population.

Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

In order to fulfill parental notification requirements for translation and interpretation services as per Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663, our school displays the Welcome Poster, Parent's Bill of Rights, Parents Guide to Language Access, 
and the Language ID Guide at the security desk and the main office. We have determined, using the data from Home 
Language Identification Survey, the RAPL report from the ATS, and meetings with the parent coordinator that there is 
an overwhelming need for written translation and oral interpretation during: 

a) Registration 

b) Orientation 

c) Parent Association meetings 

d) Parent workshops 

e) Parent/Teacher Conferences 

f) Individual Parent/Teacher meetings 

g) Annual School Based Support meetings with parents

P.S. 254 provides oral and written translation services to our parents during each of the above functions. Posters are 
prominently displayed at the entrance and in the main office informing parents of the availability of 
translation/interpretation services. Every parent is informed of their right to receive information in their language of 
choice during the one-on-one meeting with ENL staff at the time of registration.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

In order to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of translation and interpretation services, our 
school used the NYC Department of Education School Survey. Key findings from the survey are as follows:  

97% of the parents strongly agree/agree that we communicate with them in a language that they can understand. 
Parents also indicated that our school makes it easy for parents to attend meetings by holding them at different times 
of the day and providing interpreters. 98% of parents/guardians agreed or strongly agreed that the principal/school 
leader at their school promotes family and community involvement in the school. 97% of parents/guardians agreed or 
strongly agreed that they are greeted warmly when they call or visit the school. 96% of parents/guardians agreed or 
strongly agreed that they feel well-informed by the communications they receive from their child's school.  

 

It is important to note that with the availability of interpretation and translation services, we believe that parent 
involvement, understanding and participation in various school programs, events and workshops has increased. 
Parents feel more comfortable coming to school and attending different functions. As a result, they're more involved 
in their children's education and are better able to help their children to succeed in school. 

Translators and interpreters are provided to not only ELL parents, but to the entire school population when needed.
