Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

MISSION STATEMENT  

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

MS 319, Maria Teresa Mirabal School, prepares adolescents for academic excellence through a rigorous high school 
preparatory curriculum founded in the applied learning of math, science, literacy and the arts. This academic 
foundation will prepare youngsters to become the leaders of the 21st century and contributors to a global 
community--- the latter being an addition by the teachers in our summer institute.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Our school is grounded in the philosophy of addressing the whole child. MS 319 will serve as a community resource. 
Parents will be not only proud of their children, but also assured they will not only succeed but excel. Our school 
atmosphere brings to life the American Dream of equity--- Be all things to all people. We will instill in our students the 
Maria Teresa Mirabal Dream: 

“We will continue to fight for what is just.” 

We will persevere, achieve and excel. 

VISION STATEMENT 

MS 319 provides a small learning and nurturing community wherein students receive personal attention from all staff 
members. The school is grounded in the application of math, science, literacy and the arts. Students, teachers, 
parents and administrators are constantly learning and growing together ---maintaining a community which is joined 
together in a network of support, responsibility and accountability striving for student achievement. Three sets of 
values guide all of our practices---perseverance, achievement and excellence. 

 
Perseverance breeds achievement. Repeated success will encourage our students to excel and believe in themselves. 
Students are at the center of the learning experience. Our classrooms invite students to use inquiry and to apply their 
learning towards the completion of a final product. The academic rigor and character development we foster lead our 
students to excel and have earned MS 319 a stellar reputation. Our community of learners celebrate achievement. 
We provide our students with the opportunity to take their place among the most prestigious high schools in New 
York City. Finally, we provide our students with the tools for college and career readiness---an addition by the 
teachers in our summer institute.  

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
MS 319 is more than a special school. It is a home to a tight knit community of students, staff and parents. Among this 
partnership is an intense passion for building academic and social relationships coupled with an unmatched sense of 
pride in what we do here each and every day. In a word, 319 is defined by “ownership”--- in the sense that our 
community of children and adults come to the building each day to do their part in making today better than 
yesterday.  

We create and maintain an inviting and professional physical atmosphere by keeping our hallways clean and bright ----
filling them with not only student work, but cozy corners, colorful walls which come alive with paper trees, branches 
and leaves, and live plants. Inside the classrooms, the environment is sustained, offering benches, couches and rugs to 
students---so they feel at home--- comfortable to learn and explore new and exciting opportunities.  

We extend our professional environment further through the expectations in appearance we have from our students. 
When you walk down the halls of MS319 you see students in pressed shirts, blazers, ties and black dress shoes. We 
expect this level of professional appearance to set the bar for our school community--- letting our students know that 
within their urban environment, they can show that they maintain habits of professionals, and push to operate at a 
level of maturity beyond their years. In addition to appearance, we initiated a “silent passing” policy in the hallways. 
Students are expected to interact at a certain level not only in their classrooms, but in the public and shared spaces of 
the school. Administrators, teachers, parents and students themselves work to monitor and maintain this high level of 
social behavior through specific systems, policies and practices. 

Academically our community works together to make sure each student gets what he or she needs to help them 
succeed and strive to get to the next level. There are many efforts involved in this process, but two which we would 
like to highlight are our school wide clinics in Mathematics and Literacy and the Friday Clinics we have within our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

classrooms. During school-wide clinics, every teacher becomes a math or ELA teacher. Several times a year, our 
students participate in a clinic, where they travel freely around the school, visiting three classes which address skills 
they personally need, as shown through data. Students receive a new schedule for that day, and visit teachers outside 
their grade level, where they engage in not only moving lessons, but also interactive activities and games which all 
work to strengthen their particular needs. Students receive tickets based on their performance in these clinics, which 
they later redeem for prizes of their choosing. We then collect the data these clinics provide and use it to help our 
instruction grow going forward. Friday clinics are a “miniature version” of school wide clinics, wherein students are 
grouped by areas of need and work together or independently on a skill specific to their needs within their literacy 
and mathematics classrooms. 

Finally, we would like to mention a component which ties all of this together and works as not only a reward for 
students, but an experience which they look forward to and remember. At the end of each year, the eighth grade 
students attend a “Dinner Dance”, which is always held in a country club or a high-end restaurant outside of the city. 
The preparation before this event creates a buzz throughout the school. Students dress up in suits and gowns, and sit 
down to a dinner party at tables covered with linen table clothes, flowers, and polished silverware. They then enjoy 
themselves interacting socially and dancing. This is the final piece we give them as a send -off on their journey to high 
school and the future where they will continue to persevere, and achieve and excel.

skill is taught, complete with mini lesson, extended practice and a "wrap up" 

12. Adopting the "2-Day Cycle" for simulating CCLS Exams in ELA and Math (3 times per year) During the same 

cycle for ELA, Math is taught by all teachers after the test has been administered ---in this way preventing the 
disruption of Mathematics instruction.

designed in-house as well as shared and independent practice---ELA teachers are assigned "student tutors" 
from Grade 8 classes as well as provided with staff support during designated periods 

14. Mathematics instruction is taught using two curricula taught in two distinct blocks (Block A/ Block B) to 

maximize the breadth and depth of math skills covered and practiced.  

15. Implementation of a Balanced Literacy Approach to our curriculum and instructional practices to further 

support student growth.

Framework for Great Schools-- Areas of Progress 

Supportive Environment and Rigorous Instruction 

Growth in overall proficiency in Math and ELA CCLS Exam Data in all grades, and in all subgroups, has significantly 
improved over past three years. For instance, in ELA we went from 25% (in 2016) to 28% (in 2017) to 31% proficiency 
in (2018). In Math, we went from 15% (in 2016) to 23% (in 2017) to 30% proficiency in 2018. 

 

LITERACY: As per the 2017-2018 ELA CCLS State test, we experienced a net gain of 13 % in the school wide 
percentage of students scoring level 3 and 4's. 63% of our students made progress in proficiency rating and 
we experienced a net drop of 5.5% in the schoolwide percentage of students scoring a level 1 

  MATHEMATICS: As per the 2017-2018 mathematics CCLS State test, we experienced a school wide gain of 7% 
in the number of level 3 and 4's. 60% of our students made progress in proficiency rating and we experienced 
a net drop 5.5% in the schoolwide percentage of students scoring a level 1 
SOCIAL STUDIES: 81% of students demonstrating progress on the 2017-2018 MOSL  
SCIENCE: A 18.4% growth in Level 3's and 4's based on the NYS Grade 8 Science Exam

Laser Coaching 

  Dual Language Saturday Program  
  Pull Outs 
 
  Tuesday Quizzes (A/R scoring) In Literacy Tuesday quizzes were switched to a bi-weekly schedule in order to 
improve the success of re-takes, to re-inforce deficient skills and to invest increased time towards teaching 
and re-teaching of skills. Level of text complexity and length increased. In addition, rather than always 
support their own answer choice and chosen details questions asked students to refute 1 answer they 
believed to be incorrect and to support their answer with textual evidence. A word bank was also added to 
encourage students to utilize both in-class vocabulary and transitional words. Students also were assessed 
on “word parts” . Quizzes are tracked using School Wide Google Doc  Word Bank added to promote writing 
in mathematics and use o vocabulary

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
1. School Strengths: As per the 2017-2018 CCLS Mathematics Exam, we experienced a school wide gain of 6.7% in the 
number of level 3 and 4's. We experienced a 18.4% growth in Level 3's and 4's based on the NYS Grade 8 Science 
Exam 

2. Priority Need(s):  

A. Maintaining a consistent drop in Level 1 students--- We experienced a net drop of 5.5% in the school wide 
percentage of students scoring a Level 1 in Mathematics 

B. Addressing Level 1's and Low Level 2's among incoming students in Mathematics-- (58% Level 1, 68% Level 1-2.25, 
87% Level 1 or 2).  MS 319 experienced a 7.7% gain in Level 1's in the NYS Grade 8 Science Exam 

B. Maintaining and increasing rigor among math classes to maintain and continue to grow level 3 and 4 students in 
the area of mathematics and science. As per the 2017-2018 CCLS Mathematics Exam, we experienced a school wide 
gain of 6.7% in the number of level 3 and 4's. We experienced a 18.4% growth in Level 3's and 4's based on the NYS 
Grade 8 Science Exam  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, Middle School 319 students will show progress in Mathematics and Science as measured by a 10% 
decrease of Level 1 scores in the 2018- 2019 CCLS Exam in Mathematics (Grades 6-8) and the NYS Grade 8 Science Exam 
(Grade 8 students).

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Parents will engage in monthly "Learning Walks" by grade--attendance quantified by the Parent Coordinator monthly. 
These learning walks will educate parents on classroom instruction, learning environment and provide an opportunity 
for parents to present feedback to the school. In addition, through the use of Schoology, 90% of teachers or more 
enter students’ grades online for parents to see. 

A "Thursday Letter" is sent home with students each week. This letter provides parents with instructional updates, 
key information, offer tips, solutions and/or strategies on how to help students and to gather parent feedback. The 
receipt, return of these letters is monitored weekly. 

The school periodically provides materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their 
achievement level, e.g., literacy, math and use of technology. Support includes: 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community

  Hosting parent feedback sessions on topics such as Student Portfolios, In School Assessments, Curriculum, 

Student Extracurricular Activities and Overall Classroom Engagement 

  The introduction of "Parent Cells" by homeroom in grade 6. These groups serve as parent leadership among 

the community of the official class and the grade level. Parent Cells have a voice in not only school-based 
decisions but input on guiding the school community as a whole. 

Finally, the school website provides a wealth of resources and information which parents can access to help their 
children move to the next level. These include, but are not limited to school based strategies, instructional videos and 
study guides

  Class Conduct Sheets 
 
  Comment Boxes in each classroom 
  Question Charts in each classroom 
  Continued Partnership and frequent meetings between school and CAS in order to find ways to connect our 

school culture and enrichment programs/services provided 

Data on Supportive Environment at 319 is monitored, tracked and quantified by an ongoing "student survey" practice. 
The process described allows us to not only identify areas of need but more importantly to create action plans to 
address these areas. Once per month teachers ask students to formally submit concerns that they may have in or out 
of the classroom. These concerns are not limited to academic concerns, but may also include other socio-emotional 
topics and issues. Once these concerns are collected, they are reviewed and tallied. Upon review, teachers meet with 
each and supervisors to set up goals on ways to address these concerns. The teacher then implements the action 
plan(s) to address the concerns. The cycle repeats itself the next month. Teachers who often have "no concerns" in 
their classrooms are recommended to use additional feedback protocol/ strategies to make students feel comfortable 
voicing their concerns.  

This information culminates in a school-wide survey, which quantifies results on a variety of questions--- many of 
which revolve around Supportive Environment. Results are quantified and growth is monitored in December, 
February and April/May. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, students at Middle School 319 will experience a growth of 5% in each periodic administration of the in -
house 2018-2019 Middle School 319 Student Survey.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
Parents will engage in monthly "Learning Walks" by grade--attendance quantified by the Parent Coordinator monthly. 
These learning walks will educate parents on classroom instruction, learning environment and provide an opportunity 
for parents to present feedback to the school. In addition, through the use of Schoology, 90% of teachers or more 
enter students’ grades online for parents to see.

A "Thursday Letter" is sent home with students each week. This letter provides parents with instructional updates, 
key information, offer tips, solutions and/or strategies on how to help students and to gather parent feedback. The 
receipt, return of these letters is monitored weekly. 

The school periodically provides materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their 
achievement level, e.g., literacy, math and use of technology. Support includes: 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community 

  Hosting parent feedback sessions on topics such as Student Portfolios, In School Assessments, Curriculum, 

Student Extracurricular Activities and Overall Classroom Engagement 

  The introduction of "Parent Cells" by homeroom in grade 6. These groups serve as parent leadership among 

the community of the official class and the grade level. Parent Cells have a voice in not only school-based 
decisions but input on guiding the school community as a whole. 

Finally, the school website provides a wealth of resources and information which parents can access to help their 
children move to the next level. These include, but are not limited to school based strategies, instructional videos and 
study guides

high-need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

Research-based instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 

 

 

Looking at Student Work: A school specific protocol is used 
by "Teacher Teams" in order to identify trends in data 
analysis by looking at student work for accuracies and 
misconceptions, and match findings to trends and student 
goals. Misconceptions are addressed through "re-teaching" 
and the creation of different entry points. Results of the 
change strategy are measured. The cycle is repeated. 

 

Professional Development, Building Instructional Practices 
and Fostering Teacher Voice:  

“Study Groups” based on standards and instruction, research 
topics, socio-emotional/academic strategies are used to 
refine practice and classroom environment. Specific 
Professional Development Opportunities are used to support 
ELL student and those with Special Needs. Examples include 

  Explicit Teaching 
 

School Wide Assessment Collaboration Sessions 
Curriculum Feedback Sessions 

  Programming of School Wide Clinics Based on 

Student Need 

  Highlighting and Showcasing Areas of Teacher 

Expertise 

  Advanced Literacy  
  Math Application planning sessions 
  Weekly "New Teacher" meeting with Principal 

All teachers  Much of our 

work in 
"Teacher 
Teams" is 
guided by our 
Vertical and 
Horizontal 
Sessions Plan.

Ensure that all student needs are being met- Granulating 
Curriculum into achievable goals 

 

Teachers, coach's and administrators work together to 
granulate, pace and break down curriculum so that it directly 
aligns with CCLS standards. These standards then become a 
set of student goals and objectives which each learner needs 
to negotiate each unit. In this way, ALL students have access 
to learning and achievement. The curriculum is also broken 
down into a series of tasks and weekly quizzes. These are the 
materials we use to discuss student work and, discover 
trends, and refine our weekly practices in the classroom. 
These quizzes are also refined, modified, translated to 
address the needs of ELL students and those with 
disabilities. This manifests itself in the form of the weekly 
flow, which demonstrates a truly dynamic curriculum and 
programs which are adjusted and refined based on the 
percent of student who need to “Retake” weekly quizzes. 
Finally, ALL students are asked to take part in reviewing and

offering suggestions to modify curricula and learning 
activities---a process which speaks particularly to ELL and 
Students With Special Needs 

 

Processes to support teachers in analyzing student work 

Part of our looking at student work process (detailed above) 
involves carefully looking at student work through the lens of 
high-need subgroups. During this process, we look for 
misconceptions specific to these groups. We then work on 
ways to address these misconceptions/ make the skill 
tangible and successful for these students. 

 

Building teacher and student capacity to engage in rigorous 
discussions and tasks 

Student capacity to engage in rigorous discussion is built 
through many of the systems mentioned in the questions 
above. Our school wide discussion protocol models a pattern 
of discussion for our students which helps ensure that 
classroom conversation is collegial. In addition, students work 
with grade level topics, texts and tasks---being offered 
multiple entry points to not only access but succeed at 
tackling material. The school wide belief of explaining the 
“why” of a response is carried across classrooms, deepening 
both knowledge and discussion. Through modeling, coaching 
and rich discussion surrounding student work, capacity for 
rigorous discussion is being built each and every day.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
Parents will engage in monthly "Learning Walks" by grade--attendance quantified by the Parent Coordinator monthly. 
These learning walks will educate parents on classroom instruction, learning environment and provide an opportunity 
for parents to present feedback to the school. In addition, through the use of Schoology, 90% of teachers or more 
enter students’ grades online for parents to see. 

A "Thursday Letter" is sent home with students each week. This letter provides parents with instructional updates, 
key information, offer tips, solutions and/or strategies on how to help students and to gather parent feedback. The 
receipt, return of these letters is monitored weekly. 

The school periodically provides materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their 
achievement level, e.g., literacy, math and use of technology. Support includes: 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community 

  Hosting parent feedback sessions on topics such as Student Portfolios, In School Assessments, Curriculum, 

Student Extracurricular Activities and Overall Classroom Engagement 

  The introduction of "Parent Cells" by homeroom in grade 6. These groups serve as parent leadership among 

the community of the official class and the grade level. Parent Cells have a voice in not only school-based 
decisions but input on guiding the school community as a whole. 

Finally, the school website provides a wealth of resources and information which parents can access to help their 
children move to the next level. These include, but are not limited to school based strategies, instructional videos and 
study guides

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
School beliefs about how adults learn best and our beliefs drive teacher feedback cycles  

We believe that adults learn best when they: 

1.  Understand why something is important to know or do. 
2.  Feel empowered, valued and respected for their experiences, perspectives and contributions. 
3.  Know the learning experience is active rather than passive. 
4.  Know that learning occurs in small groups and that the process is positive and encouraging. 
5.  Realize that learning is applied immediately 
6.  Our beliefs help teachers provide feedback that promotes students’ intellectual growth, autonomy and equity 
in their classrooms. Furthermore, it helps teachers create opportunities for their own growth as they identify 
and revise strategies that do not serve them, their students, or the schools. 

Strategies for recruitment, retention, growth and assignments

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Approach to the use of assessments our school community 

 

Multiple school-wide tools, in all subjects, are used to assess student learning. Some examples are: Weekly fluency 
practices, weekly Tuesday quizzes, Daily Exit Tickets, cumulative unit assessments, end of unit projects and learning 
goal trials (up to three trials per learning goal). The rationale behind using frequent and diverse assessment tools is to 
offer students multiple opportunities for improvement. We offer students several trials (up to 3), within pre-
determined time periods, to show mastery of the skill(s). Throughout these trials, teacher teams looks for errors and 
misconceptions that might impede or interfere with student progress. When students get a task right the first time, 
the task is labeled “A” for “achieved”. If he/she gets the task wrong, it is labeled “R” for “re-take”. The “R-students” 
receive additional interventions (pull-out, clinics and after school services) and are later re-assessed in an identical 
task. In addition, students are given CCLS aligned portfolio tasks, in all subjects. These tasks are scored, feedback is 
given (Week A), and students systemically address teacher feedback bi-weekly (Week B) 

 

Examples of what assessment data has revealed in terms of student knowledge and skills  

For instance, teacher teams have observed that errors and misconceptions are rooted in either conceptual confusion, 
developmental deficiency (lack of real world application) or language issues (question wording stand-alone words 
etc.). For example: Teacher teams have observed that when 7th graders work with ratios, some students write a ratio 
with reverse values; or when they work with percents they thinking that percents cannot be bigger that 100%, and 
therefore consistently demonstrate difficulty understanding that an “increase by 5%” is the same as “multiply by 
1.05.” In addition, when 7th graders work with money—such as calculating sales tax--- some students round the sales 
tax to three decimal places failing to realize that there is no such thing as a “thousandth of a dollar” or a coin whose 
value is less than a penny. Such misconceptions resulted in adaptation of the unit of study to address a series of 
misconceptions. From this “bank”, scaffolding is created to help overcome the re-occurrence of these 
misunderstandings. In Literacy, both 7th and 8th grade students share the misconception of ‘Evidence vs 
Explanation”---to varying degrees of severity. In other words, students have the ability to select and extract 
information which may support an inference they make. However, when it comes to explaining how this evidence 
supports the inference, responses can be convoluted and disconnected--- or students simply extract another piece of 
text evidence instead of explaining the first. 

Building teacher capacity in using different types of data to adjust curriculum and instruction  

We build teacher capacity by using different types of data to adjust curriculum and instruction. We have developed a 
process in which Teacher Teams meet weekly (vertically by department, horizontally by grade level) in order to 
promote sharing of strong practices, analysis student work, identification of trends, accuracies and misconceptions. 
We strive to improve student learning by, adjusting curriculum pacing, designing mini-lessons and students offering 
multiple-entry points. Finally, we track and quantify those students who are consistently or chronically in need of 
multiple opportunities for success and offer them multiple outlets by adjusting pull-out groups, and diversifying 
instruction. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

How do teachers check for understanding? How do they create structures for students to self-assess and reflect on 
their own progress? What has been the impact of such assessments on teaching and learning? 

School-wide, teachers use a variety of tools to check for understanding. For instance, teachers and students: 

Use traffic lights, thumbs up/down/sideways to check for understanding during instruction. 

Teacher and students engage in a bi-weekly cycles (Week A and Week B) in which students work independently to 
address teacher’s feedback. 

Students engage in Turn-and-Talk and Buddy system protocols to negotiate meaning and arrive at solutions. 

Both students and teachers populate “Learning Objective/Goal” charts throughout the course of the unit of study 
identifying goals that have been met. These charts are based on the results of “Tuesday Quizzes” and serve as a way 
to easily identify and address (through re-teaching and re-assessment) misconceptions based on specific standards 
and skills. Parents are able to monitor student performance via Engrade. This structure helps redirect resources in an 
effort to support those students who have not met their learning goals. Additionally, parents have access to 
instructional videos aligned with both CCLS and learning goals in order to support their children at home. 

Assessments are cumulative and aligned to New York State CCLS. Unit assessments are made up of both multiple 
choice and open-ended responses that are standard based. Each unit assessment questioned is matched to a specific 
Common Core standard, domain and cluster. 

Periodic Assessment Data is analyzed in house. Data is broken down by grade, standard, level of deficiency and 
frequency. This data is used to inform classroom groupings and future assessments, tasks and lessons. 

 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. M.S 319 Maria Teresa School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community.  

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72 

 

● Provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● Host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● Conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

● Holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● Hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● Encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● Supporting or hosting Family Day events;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

   MS 319's Saturday Direct Instructional Program focuses on Newcomers, Developing 
ELLs, and long term ELLs who are struggling academically based on the student's risk level 
from the EDAT data in conjunction with ongoing school-wide assessments in both 
ELA/ENL and mathematics.  Approximately 75 students (5 classes of 15 students each) will be 
serviced in this program throughout the school year. The students were selected based on their 
needs as reflected on the 2018 NYSESLAT results in conjunction with their academic 
achievement in Math and ELA. In addition, a English Reading and Writing-focused after school 
program will be provided to those students that need the extra support as indicated on the 2018 
NYSESLAT Scores ( 3 classes of 10 students each). The language or instruction will be English 
for the ELA classes, and English and Spanish for Math depending on the student's choice and 
English language profinciency level. 
   MS 319's adherence to the 90/90/90 tenet of Multiple Opportunities for Improvement has 
resulted in the development of school-wide weekly quizzes in both ELA and mathematics.  This 
past year, the school piloted a method of tracking student performance on these weekly quizzes 
through an online spreadsheet shared by the teachers and administrators.  When students Achieve 
(perform at or above 80%) on a quiz, they move on to the next skill or goal in each 
class.  However, when a student performs under the 80% threshold, their quiz is marked as 
Retake.  This means that while the student will also be exposed to the new skill or goals, they 
will be receiving targeted intervention in the skill that they have not mastered in order to be able 
to demonstrate achievement on a future retake opportunity.  One of the outcomes of this year's 
data analysis was that ELLs were underachieving in both mathematics and ELA quizzes, yet 
unsurprisingly, noticeably more in ELA.   
   In order to better support MS 319's ELL students, the school will be providing a supplemental 
direct instruction program on Saturdays based on the skills on which a need is demonstrated 
through weekly assessments. This focus on revisiting those skills that students had difficulty with 
will compose the ENL portion of the Saturday program.  The program will take place on 
Saturdays, 10:00 - 12:00 over 20 weeks. Instruction will be allocated for explicit teaching in 
English Literacy and ENL instruction focused on the four modalities (Listening, Speaking, 
Reading, and Writing).  
   Students who demonstrated regression or lack of progress (remained at the same level) on their 
English proficiency level as reflected on the EDAT and also have low achievement in the content 
areas will be prioritized when creating the classes.  The program will respond to students' 
specific needs by separating them by English Performance Levels according to the 
2018 NYSESLAT results as follows: 
- Two bridge classes  (6 -7 & 7 - 8) will each be composed of 15 Entering and Emerging 
students.  These students will receive mathematics instruction in their home language and ENL 
instruction with a focus on English language acquisition in the four modalities (Listening, 
Speaking, Reading, and Writing).  Two bilingual teachers will split their instructional time 
amongst these two classes.  While one class works on math, the other works on ENL and vice 
versa.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
 - Three classes will be composed of 15 Transitioning and Expanding students each by grade 
level (6th, 7th, & 8th).  These students will receive explicit mathematics instruction in English 
with home language support, ENL instruction with a focus on English language acquisition in 
the four modalities (Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing), and ELA instruction based on 
the skills they have missed according to quiz results. Three teachers (1 bilingual, 1 ENL, 1 
content area) will split their instructional time amongst these three groups so that the groups 
rotate through the three subject areas: Math, ENL, and ELA. 
   Each class will have 15 students total taught by four ENL or bilingually certified teachers and 
one content area math teacher serving all the ELLs. The program will run for 16 weeks, 
culminating in May, 2019.  The teachers serving the ELLs in the Title III program are either 
bilingual certified, mathematics content area teachers or ENL certified teachers.

grades. In order to further support student development of English literacy while continuing to 
grapple with the grade-level expectations, our students greatly benefit from the MyON online 
reading program.  Teachers assign texts that support ELLs to simultaneously build literacy skills 
and prior knowledge aligned with the current unit of study in ELA.  This program has many 
visuals, highlights new vocabulary, reads text out-loud to struggling readers while they follow 
along, provides students and teachers a way to interact with the text electronically, allows 
teachers to monitor student engagement, and can be used independently, with a small group, or 
on the school’s interactive whiteboards.  One of the goals of MS 319 is to have each student read 
25 books per year, including at least four books in social studies and three books in science.  The 
MyON library is a priceless resource to meet this goal.  MyON provides students a plethora of 
reading material that they can choose to interact with, particularly non-fictions texts on scientific 
and historical topics.  Many studies have shown that in addition to a rigorous curriculum, free, 
voluntary reading plays a significant role in literacy development.  MyON can be accessed from 
anywhere due its online nature.  Students are able to engage with the texts on computers, tablets, 
even on their phones.  MS319 provides training for parents in order to encourage family 
involvement and collaboration.  The school monitors student comprehension of MyON texts 
through the Renaissance Reading Program.   The background knowledge students attain from 
reading through MyON supports higher comprehension levels of the Common Core curriculum 
and therefore improves student engagement with higher-level texts.

MS 319's Title III Professional Development focuses on training teachers to implement rigorous, 
Common Core-aligned instruction focused on the scaffolding necessary for ELLs to succeed 
academically. Five teachers will receive three two-hour sessions for a total of six hours of 
professional development.  Teachers will be trained in Explicit Teaching for ELA and 
Mathematics according to their teaching assignments, and Cooperative Learning Strategies (i.e. 
Emerging Bilingual Literacy Protocol, Emerging Bilingual Mini-Lesson Protocol, Literary 
Circles, and Buddy System).  The trainings will be conducted by the supervisor of the program 
as well as MS 319's Bilingual Coordinator.  These sessions will take place after school on 
selected Fridays and will therefore result in per session costs to the Title III Program.   Once the 
teachers who participate in these five teachers are trained, they will turn-key the strategies and 
share them with their colleagues during Monday's contractual PD sessions.  Professional 
development hours will also be used to provide teachers with feedback and planning for next 
steps based on observations made by the program supervisor.  
Session 1: "New Teacher Boot Camp": This session will be offered to teachers who are new to 
MS 319 as well as returning teachers who are in need of support. Sessions will be held from 
August 27 to 31 and will focus on all classroom practices that support ELLs. 
Session 2: A- 11/16/18:  Explicit Teaching in the ELA/ENL classroom (2 hours) - ELA Teachers 
                  B- 12/14/18: Explicit Teaching in the Mathematics classroom (2 hours) - Math 
Teachers 
Session 3: 1/11/18: Use of Cooperative Learning Strategies to Maximize ELL Engagement and 
Performance (2 hours) - All Teachers 
PD Provider: Rose Abreu (Bilingual Coordinator) and Penelope Duda (Assistant Principal in 
charge of ELL Services) 
 These sessions are conducted during the school day either during set-aside staff development 
times or using flexible scheduling.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
that their students will be exposed to throughout the year will allow them to be more involved in 
the students' education.  Parents and students will also benefit from the ongoing communication 
between the school and the home regarding the progress of our Emergent Bilingual 
students.  These meetings will be conducted by bilingual staff members.  Throughout these 
meetings parents of Emergent Bilingual students will also be receiving information regarding 
opportunities to continue engaging their students in learning outside of school. 
  Parents will me notified of these meetings through bilingual school mailings as well as 
reminded by phone calls in their home language.  These meetings will be conducted by bilingual 
staff members including and ENL teachers who will be paired up with the support of 
bilingual teachers for translation purposes.  Attendance records will be kept in the Title III binder 
and will be encouraged by offering rewards (at through MS 319's rewards program) to students 
whose parents attend the workshops. 
  MEETING 1 (12/8/18) will be the dual language and bilingual pin ceremony in which 
parents are invited to celebrate their students' efforts in becoming bilingual, biliterate and 
bicultural, life-long language learners. Teachers and students will share student work and all 
students will receive their "pins of biliteracy" 
MEETINGS 2, 3 and 4 (May 2019); Building on the success of the 2017-18 series of arts and 
crafts workshops, MS will continue a series of workshops organized in conjunction with the MS 
319 Parents Association focused on arts, crafts and cooking projects for the whole 
family.  Parents of students from all backgrounds, and primarily students from the MS 319 
bilingual and dual language program, are invited to share skills with the school community.

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 
Emergent Bilingual students at MS 319 participate in all school wide assessments throughout the content areas.  Each 
department administers baselines, periodic, and summative assessments.  All assessments are translated for DL and TBE 
classes.   
In mathematics all students take departmental weekly quizzes that are closely monitored by teachers and administrators to 
ensure that students are meeting grade level standards.  Students are given multiple opportunities to achieve on quizzes 
through in-class clinics.  Emergent Bilingual students who are placed in Transitional Bilingual or Dual Language programs have 
access to these quizzes in their Home Language, Spanish.  Emergent Bilingual students who are placed in ENL classes are 
provided with grade-level mathematics glossaries according to their home languages.  Students are also assessed through the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          84 

 

use of STAR Math tests on Renaissance, which are available in Spanish for Emergent Bilingual students to demonstrate their 
mathematics level independently from their ENL level.  These assessments can pinpoint to a student’s area of focus. 
Transitioning and Expanding Emergent Bilingual students participate in weekly departmental quizzes as part of their Integrated 
ENL/ELA courses.  Teachers provide appropriate scaffolding such as word banks, sentence frames, or graphic organizers as 
needed.  The results are closely monitored by teachers and administrators.  These students also produce English essays that 
are Common Core aligned with appropriate scaffolding from their ENL/ELA teacher.  Entering and Emerging Emerging Bilingual 
students are accountable for departmental ENL vocabulary quizzes instead of the ELA quizzes.  Additionally, all Emergent 
Bilingual students participate in STAR Reading Assessments at least three times throughout the school year in order to 
demonstrate their English reading comprehension progress.  These assessments pinpoint to particular areas of strength and 
weakness that teachers can use in their instructional planning.  Students also use Renaissance Reading book quizzes as 
assessments of their developing reading skills. All students, including Emergent Bilingual students are expected to achieve 80% 
or higher on 25 book quizzes throughout the school year.  In the case of Emergent Bilingual students, these books may be a 
combination of English and home language books.   
As part of Emergent Bilingual students’ Freestanding ENL course, students are exposed to unit quizzes in the USA Learns online 
English Language development program. 
In order to assess Emergent Bilingual students’ home language literacy skills, students are assessed thoroughly in their HLA 
classes.  Assessments include departmental reading quizzes, CCLS-aligned portfolio tasks, and unit projects which include 
graphic organizers as well as multiple drafts of written pieces.  Students are also assessed in their Spanish reading levels three 
times a year through the Spanish STAR Test in Renaissance. 
Weekly Quizzes and Writing Performance Tasks are used to track students’ achievement in Social Studies.  Portfolio Tasks and 
End-of Unit Assessments are provided to measure achievement in Science.  All of these assessments are provided in the home 
language for bilingual students in the TBE or DL programs.  ENL program students receive ENL support, strategies, and bilingual 
glossaries to assist them in completing these tasks.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

MS 319 is able to implement and closely monitor these assessments through the use of the school wide Quiz Quantification 
Form.  All teachers are able to input results as they administer and mark the assessments.  Administrators can also access this 
data and make decisions about interventions.  Additionally, MS319 has a Literacy Coach, Math Coach, Science Teacher Leader, 
Social Studies Teacher Leader, and the Bilingual Coordinator (ENL & HLA departments) who facilitate teacher discussions and 
efforts to administer and analyze assessments.  Teachers meet weekly with their Department Coaches or Teacher Leaders to 
analyze student work.  At these meetings, ENL or bilingual teachers sit together in order to compare results, analyze trends 
that are specific to Emergent Bilingual student subgroups, and prepare scaffolds and lessons to share with the group.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
MS319 also utilizes city wide and department created assessments to monitor Emergent Bilingual students’ progress.  The 
school administers HLA, ENL, Mathematics, ELA, Science, and Social Studies Baselines (Fall), Benchmark (Spring), and End of 
Year assessments  in order to gauge annual growth in all content areas.  These assessments are provided in the home language 
for Emergent Bilingual students in TBE or DL programs.  Glossaries are provided for students in the ENL programs.  The 
detailed rubrics of these assessments are used as guidelines for instructional planning according to the “Traits”  or skills in 
which students demonstrate greater need. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Students who do not achieve an 80% or higher on any given departmental quiz will have an opportunity to retake the 
assessment after a targeted skill clinic in their own classroom.  The results of this second attempt are also tracked on each 
department's’ Quiz Quantification Form.  ENL and bilingual content area teachers pull out Emergent Bilingual students who do 
not demonstrate mastery after their second quiz administration for support in certain skills according to the tracking 
documents and provide targeted intervention before administering the assessment for a third attempt.  In this way, the school 
ensures that students have had multiple opportunities to achieve on all grade-level skills.  This data is also tracked on each 
department’s Quiz Quantification Form.  Correlations between teacher team planning, intervention, and student achievement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          85 

 

 

on periodic assessments are also analyzed in order to provide feedback to content area teachers, intervention teachers, and 
instructional coaches. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
MS 319 does not have K - 5 classes. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
One of the first assessments that MS319 considers while programming Emergent Bilingual students is the 
NYSESLAT.  According to student progress on English Language Proficiency Levels, students must be programmed to meet at 
least their minimum ENL  and HLA minutes.  Additionally, the school makes decisions about about push in or pull out services 
according to student achievement as demonstrated on ELA, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Science assessments.  Since 
Emergent Bilingual students in TBE or DL programs (according to parental choice) may be assessed in Spanish in the content 
areas, the school can tailor intervention for them according to their academic and language needs jointly.  Students in the ENL 
program (according to parental choice) are carefully assessed and provided with flexibility during testing including bilingual 
glossaries in all NY State Exams.  An Entering or Emerging student, as evidenced by NYSESLAT results, may not need 
mathematics intervention if she is scoring proficiently (levels 3 or 4) on the NY State Mathematics Assessment.  On the other 
hand, a student who reaches a Transitioning or Expanding level on the NYSESLAT, but only reaches a level 1 or 2 in 
mathematics may need more support in this content area.  All of these factors are taken into consideration when 
programming Emergent Bilingual students’ ENL and intervention services.  The school uses the ELL Data Analysis Tool (formerly 
the AMAO) to look for trends and patterns in risk factors for students.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Assessment results and analyses are disseminated among the school staff through professional development and teacher team 
sessions (Mondays) as well as through the Quiz Quantification Form.  At the beginning of the school year, all teachers receive 
assessment data for all students.  This information is printed, presented, and discussed at staff meetings.  Teachers also 
receive this information digitally.  NYSESLAT results (or NYSITELL in case of new arrivals) is also shared through the school’s 
“Flow of the Day”, a daily email with important information.  Teachers are trained as to the meaning of the English Proficiency 
Levels as well as appropriate activities and expectations of language support.  As mentioned before, students’ weekly quizzes 
are tracked through a school wide system online.  This Quiz Quantification Form identifies students who are Emergent Bilingual 
students, Students with Disabilities, and/or students who scored in the lowest 25% in the specific content area assessments 
from the previous year.  Additionally, this sheet identifies the students who are receiving pull out intervention by a content 
area or ENL teacher.  In this way, teachers, coaches, and school leaders can identify class trends and particular students or 
subgroups who are exceeding grade level expectations or are performing at very low levels.  As a result of these analyses, 
decisions are made regarding the next steps and goals for each department.  This is reflected weekly through the “Weekly 
Flows” that are prepared and shared by the coaches and teacher leaders.  These “Weekly Flows” highlight vocabulary and 
content skills of focus for the upcoming week in each department. Teacher teams meet on Mondays to analyze student work 
and prepare new lessons to address students’ needs. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          86 

 

 

Students whose parents opt for the Freestanding ENL program are placed in heterogeneous classes by grade 
level.  These students are exposed to an English only curriculum with some home language support through 
educational materials, bilingual glossaries, and technology support.  Students who are placed in these monolingual 
classes are provided ENL services through an integrated model with the ENL teacher pushing-in during content area 
instruction according to students’ needs. Students at Entering and Emerging levels also receive pull out services as 
their Stand-Alone ENL component. 
  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Students whose parents select the transitional Bilingual Education program are grouped by grade level for their 
content areas (mathematics, science, social studies, HLA, and electives).  However, these students go into 
homogeneous groups for their integrated ELA/ENL classes daily.  Students in the school’s seventh and eighth grade 
TBE classes split into two groups.  One group is composed of Entering and Emerging seventh and eighth graders who 
go to one ENL teacher and  the Transitioning and Expanding students go to another. After the two periods of ELA/ENL, 
students return to their grade-level classes.  Content area teachers use a variety of heterogeneous and homogeneous 
grouping during their classes in order to ensure that each student’s language development is supported.  While most 
of the content is taught in the home language, Spanish, students receive differentiated materials according to their 
English proficiency levels.  Entering and Emerging students work mostly in Spanish, while also receiving English 
instruction appropriate to their level through trade books and technology.  Transitioning and Expanding students 
work mostly in English.  Students continue to develop their home language literacy skills through the HLA class.  This is 
a Spanish class in which students engage in rigorous text discussions and CCLS-aligned tasks throughout the school 
year.  Students also have bilingual libraries in their classrooms to support their HLA literacy development. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

MS319’s Dual Language Program is composed of English proficient students and Emergent Bilingual Students.  At the 
sixth-grade level, the ratio is close to 50-50.  As Emergent Bilingual Students achieve proficiency, parents often choose 
to remain in the program.  This leads to the ratio of Emergent Bilingual Students decreasing in the seventh and eighth 
grades with former Emergent Bilingual Students becoming the largest ratio of the population overall.  According to 
the 2016 NYSESLAT most of the Emergent Bilingual Students have achieved the Transitioning or Expanding levels, with 
a few scoring at the Commanding level.  MS319’s DL program achieves a 50-50 ratio of Spanish and English instruction 
through bilingual Core Content Areas, ELA/ENL classes, and the HLA class.  The sixth-grade ELA class is taught by an 
ENL certified teacher who provides Integrated ENL/ELA leveled scaffolds to the high-level CCLS-aligned Balanced 
Literacy curriculum.  The eighth grade DL ELA class is taught by an ENL certified teacher as well.  Twice a week (4 
periods in total or 180 minutes), the DL seventh and eighth graders split into homogeneous groups with the Emergent 
Bilingual Students and former Emergent Bilingual Students receiving ENL/ELA instruction by the ENL certified teacher 
who usually teaches the eighth grade class.  The remainder of the students would go to the seventh grade ELA teacher 
for continued ELA instruction during those periods.  The mathematics curriculum is broken up into units.  Half of the 
units will be taught in English, while the other half will be taught in Spanish by a bilingual certified teacher.  The 
science and social studies content areas are taught by  bilingual teachers and instruction will switch languages 
weekly.  All DL students will also have a separate HLA class which will always be taught in Spanish.  HLA literacy is 
supported by bilingual libraries in all DL classrooms. 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Students who are in the FENL program receive Integrated ENL through an ENL teacher supporting them through Core Content 
Areas four periods a week or 180 minutes.  This may happen during ELA periods or other content areas, according to students’ 
needs.  Students who are in the Entering or Emerging levels will also receive Stand-Alone ENL services by being pulled out of 
class in small groups by an ENL teacher for four periods or 180 additional minutes.  This would ensure that Entering and 
Emerging students receive a total of 360 ENL minutes, while Transitioning, Expanding, or recently (last 2 years) Commanding 
students receive 180 ENL minutes.   
In the TBE program students receive Integrated ENL/ELA and Stand-Alone services directly by their ELA teacher.  In the sixth-

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          87 

 

grade, this would be a Common Branch Bilingual Certified teacher.  The seventh and eighth graders in the TBE program receive 
Integrated ENL/ELA in homogeneous groups.  The EN and EM students from both grades go to one ENL teacher, while the TR 
and EX students go to another.  This split/bridge is exclusively programmed for the ENL/ELA periods.  The TR/EX students 
receive Integrated ENL/ELA with leveled scaffolds for 10 periods per week or 450 minutes.  Students in the EN/EM split receive 
Integrated ENL/ELA three times a week,  6 periods per week or 270 minutes.  Students are instructed on CCLS-aligned lessons 
that have been adapted and leveled with the guidance of the Bilingual Common Core Initiative by skill.  These students also 
receive 180 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL twice a week, for a total of 4 periods or 180 minutes.  During these periods students 
rotate through different language centers such as English learning digital programs, listening centers with scaffolds and 
questions, lesson-related vocabulary practice activities, readers theater activities with teacher guidance, and instruction on 
English language structures appropriate to their level.  These students are additionally programmed for five periods or 225 
minutes per week of HLA.  Other Core Content Areas (mathematics, science, and social studies) are instructed mostly by 
bilingual teachers with English language activities woven throughout according to student levels.   
Students in the sixth-grade and eighth-grade DL program have an ENL certified teacher as their ELA teacher, ensuring that they 
receive all the ENL service they need (up to 450 minutes).  The ENL teacher appropriately designs activities for this student to 
receive a minimum of 180 Stand-Alone ENL minutes during their ELA periods.  DL seventh-grade students who are entitled to 
ENL services all achieved at the TR/EX and CM (last 2 years) levels.  These students receive Integrated ENL services twice a 
week or 4 periods (180 minutes) when they split from their classes into a homogeneous group that is instructed by the eighth-
grade ENL teacher.  If any students at the EN or EM levels should enter the seventh-grade with a parental selection of DL 
programming in the, these students would be pulled out to receive 4 Stand-Alone ENL periods or 180 additional minutes for a 
total of 360 ENL minutes.  All DL students are programmed for HLA instruction 5 periods per week or 225 minutes.  The 
remaining content areas alternate between Spanish and English by week (math, science, and social studies). 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Teachers at MS319 design lessons in alignment with the RSE-TASC Explicit Teaching Rubric, which ensures that students are 
exposed to new materials in a thoughtful, systematic way.  It includes connections to previous learning and future 
applications, introduction to relevant vocabulary, and a gradual release model of presenting the lesson objectives.  First, the 
teacher models (I do), then the students take part in guided practice (We do), lastly, the students are sent off to work 
independently or in collaborative groups that are strategically designed with tasks that provide multiple entry 
points.  Throughout the lessons, students take notes and are encouraged to show their level of understanding through the use 
of “Traffic Lights”.  Each student has a key ring with a red, yellow, and green card which they use to show their mastery level 
throughout the lesson.  This model has been implemented in all Core Content Areas.   
All teachers at MS319 are trained and supported in the use of school-wide systems that support language development and 
engagement with rigorous CCLS-aligned content for all students.  These systems, protocols, and rubrics have been created and 
implemented by the school staff.  All of the systems are made available to students in all classrooms as well as in students’ 
Agendas.  Additionally, all of these have been translated and are practiced in all Content Areas according to the instructional 
language of the class/day.  The first few weeks of school (particularly in the sixth-grade), the whole school reviews the 
protocols in order to allow students to focus on the processes of making meaning, collaborating, and ensuring that they are 
guided by the rubrics with which their work will be marked throughout the school year.  These protocols also provide students 
with sample language structures to pull from as they share their thoughts with each other.    
Some of the systems are designed with a focus on reading including the Literary Circles Rubric, Buddy System Protocol for 
Reading, and the Emergent Bilingual Literacy Protocol.  As a common thread, they all specify steps that students should take 
before reading, during reading, and after reading to ensure deep comprehension of texts.  Other systems support students in 
the completion of collaborative class work.  These include: the Buddy System Protocol for Writing, Buddy System Protocol for 
Mathematics, and the Turn and Talk Rubric.  Again, these protocols contain steps that students should take before beginning 
to answer, during their work, and after they have completed the task, ensuring that they see the value of the writing process 
in all assignments.  Lastly, MS319 uses systems for students to manage their own learning including the Clinics Rubric and the 
Self-Management of Learning Protocol.  These protocols focus students’ attention on learning by guiding them through 
reading, collaborating, completing tasks, and also assessing and reflecting on their own learning.   Providing students with 
familiar processes with which to explore content throughout all Core Content Areas encourages students to focus on the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          88 

 

content and language objectives at hand.  This is particularly important for Emergent Bilingual Students.   
 
 
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Students in the TBE and DL programs are assessed in Spanish throughout the school year.  As soon as students are registered, 
the Bilingual Coordinator administers the Spanish Lab and conducts an informal Spanish literacy assessment.  Information 
gathered through the intake process is then shared with all the teachers, coaches, and administration.  As students begin the 
school year they participate in the HLA Fall Benchmark in Spanish.  The results of this exam are used to plan the learning 
objectives of the first unit of study and to create flexible instructional groupings.  These results are shared with the Core 
Content Area teachers during Teacher Team meetings.  Teachers can monitor student improvement through the 
administration of the Central HLA Spring Assessment.  Additionally, students are assessed through the Renaissance Star 
Reading Test in Spanish.  The participate in this assessment three times during the year: in September, January, and May.   
Students also participate in Core Content Assessments in Spanish (at the school level).  Students will receive assessments (quiz, 
portfolio tasks) according to the language of instruction of the class/day.  Exams, on the other hand are provided in both 
English and Spanish and students may choose to take it in either language or side-by-side.  English proficient students in the DL 
classes as well as Emergent Bilingual students in DL and TBE classes all take the ELE exam every spring.  The results of this exam 
allow the school to determine the effectiveness of Spanish instruction.   
Emergent Bilingual students from different language groups in the ENL program are assessed through interactive websites that 
have leveled quizzes which provide scores.  The other language group, besides Spanish, that is shared by Emergent Bilingual 
students at MS319 is Arabic.  Arabic speaking students who are newcomers are assessed using 
www.madinaharabic.com/quiz.  This website provides quizzes that range in levels, including beginner, intermediate, and 
advanced.  The quizzes include listening, grammar, and reading comprehension assessments.  Since the school does not have 
any Arabic speaking staff, English proficient students who speak Arabic are used as resources for the newly arrived students. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

All teachers at MS319 are trained in the use of protocols that support student comprehension and productive language.  These 
protocols are used throughout all content areas and they specify roles for students.  Teachers can strategically assign roles 
according to students content and language mastery.  These practices in and of themselves provide a differentiated learning 
environment for all students in all classes.   
 
In general, most (68 out of 85) parents of Newcomers select the TBE program for their children.  Additionally, Emergent 
Bilinguals who come from different elementary schools are mostly in the TBE program as well.  This trend results in most 
(80/155) of the school’s Emergent Bilingual population being in the TBE program.  Students that are in the TBE program are 
grouped by language proficiency instead of grade level (up to two grades per group) for ENL/ELA.  This means that the seventh 
and eighth graders in the TBE program split from their Content Area grade level classes into language proficiency groups for 
ENL/ELA.  In these ENL/ELA classes, teachers can target the specific skills that are developmentally appropriate for each 
subgroup: SIFE, Newcomers, Developing, and Long Term ELLs.   
Emergent Bilinguals who are in the DL program are also monitored according to their English proficiency levels.  There have 
been two Newcomers in the 2016-2017 school year who were placed in the DL program by their parents.  These students 
receive differentiated work in ENL/ELA and during English weeks. 
 
SIFE: Students who have been identified as SIFE through the identification process are closely monitored throughout their daily 
classes.  Parents of fourteen out of the sixteen students who are identified as SIFE have selected the TBE program.  This means 
that these students are grouped by English proficiency for their ENL/ELA class.  Additionally, they receive targeted home 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          89 

 

language literacy intervention in the Core Content Areas and in HLA class.  Students labeled as SIFE who are not in the TBE 
program are in the ENL program.  These students receive literacy intervention during their ELA periods as well as through 
Social Studies ENL support.  Spanish libraries are available in the bilingual classrooms in many different levels in order to 
support continued literacy engagement.   
Newcomers: As stated above, most Newcomers’ parents opt for the TBE program in which ENL/ELA Integrated classes are split 
by English language proficiency.  Additionally, these students receive most of their Core Content Area instruction in Spanish or 
through ENL strategies appropriate for each level.  Newcomers in the DL and FENL programs are also closely monitored.  When 
possible, they too are sent to the Newcomer class of the TBE program (for ENL/ELA class only) and then they return to their 
regular class.  If this is not a possibility, the student is pulled out to work Stand-Alone ENL in a small group setting.  MS319 uses 
the Bilingual Common Core Progressions to design English Literacy lessons in which student output is scaffolded according to 
their level.  In the case of Entering and Emerging level students, this means that they receive questions and answers separately 
and are tasked to match each question to the answer that corresponds to it.  In the case of writing activities, it might mean 
that students receive cloze activities with wordbanks.  Additionally, These students participate in “Language Development 
Centers” twice a week.  These Stand-alone ENL classes (4 periods per week) allow students to focus on social and academic 
language development in the four modalities.  Content Area teachers are trained to apply strategies that will make content 
comprehensible and support students in producing language (writing or speaking) for assessment purposes.  Many Spanish 
books are included in the classroom libraries for these students to engage with both literature and content reading. 
Developing: Developing ELLs are equally distributed between the school’s bilingual programs (DL and TBE) and the FENL 
program.  Half of the Developing ELLs in the FENL program are also Students with Disabilities.  These students benefit from the 
use of the Bilingual Common Core Progressions that guide lesson planning as well as from access to bilingual libraries and 
glossaries.   
Long-Term ELLs: Long Term ELLs are mostly (13 out of 18) part of the FENL program.  Most of them (10 out of 18) are 
considered Students with Disabilities. These students’ NYSESLAT results are shared with all service providers so that the 
language needs are addressed holistically.  While many of these students have achieved native-like conversational English, 
they have a difficult time applying academic language, particularly in their writing.  In order to address this need, students are 
trained throughout the school year in the use of transitional words, essay structure, as well as construction of short and 
extended responses.  Additionally, students participate in extensive vocabulary instruction focused on deconstructing words 
into prefixes, lexemes, and suffixes in order to figure out their meaning.  These skills are spiraled into all the Core Content 
Areas.   
Former ELLs up to two years: As much as possible, parents of students who exit out of the ELL status are encouraged to remain 
or move into the DL program.  They are usually in agreement as they see the value of their children’s bilingualism.  These 
students are then monitored by the ELA, ENL, and Content Area bilingual teachers in order to ensure that they are able to 
demonstrate their learning in English or Spanish appropriately.  They become part of the English Proficient group as they 
continue to participate in bilingual instruction.  Students who are not in the DL program are placed in classes in which there 
are Emergent Bilingual students at different levels receiving services.  They are included in the intervention list of the ENL 
teacher assigned to the group.  In either case, these students are pushed to continue developing academic language as many 
of the supports provided for Emergent Bilingual Students are not directly provided to them, but remain available if needed. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Through the use of multiple entry points, presentation of content in different formats, and hands-on activities, students are 
able to develop both their content area skills and language skills.  The Bilingual and Special Education teams collaborate 
throughout the year to ensure that appropriate materials are ordered and teachers are trained in their use when 
necessary.  These materials may include: graphic novels, differentiated vocabulary books, independent white boards, writing 
utensils, manipulatives, and technology to address specific needs of the school’s ELL-SWD population. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Students with Disabilities participate in all Common Core Aligned units and designed by each Core Content Area 
department.  The Special Education Teachers who work with these students are part of the Teacher Teams and are in charge of 
scaffolding and differentiating the work for their students.  As stated above, all service providers (Special Education Teachers, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          90 

 

Speech Teacher, Counselors, Occupational Therapists, etc.) are made aware of each student’s needs with regards to academic 
language development.  All teachers are required to create instructional goals around the student’s IEP, which means all 
teachers must look at each student’s IEP and based on what the IEP says they must create short term goals (for the marking 
period) and a plan with strategies they plan to use to ensure the student meets their semester goals.   When looking at the IEP, 
the teacher also looks at the NYSESLAT data results and creates a plan with the language goals and targets as well. When 
designing the plan the teacher must consider the child’s disabilities as well as their language proficiency. The Special education 
department and the ENL department co-facilitate workshops throughout the year to support the teachers in helping them 
address and support this population of learners. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All teachers at MS319 are trained to implement many intervention strategies within their classrooms.  These include: strategic 
grouping, use of self-assessment strategies in class through the “traffic lights” system, purposefully designed tasks with 
multiple entry points, use of protocols that differentiate process and provide language scaffolds, monitoring of quiz data 
through departmental quizzes, designing content clinics that target specific skills a student may need support in, use of 
technology to implement interactive whole-class lessons as well as individualized instruction.   
Beyond the classroom, students are selected for pull out services in mathematics and ELA according to the previous year’s 
state assessment results and classroom performance.  Teachers have pull-out periods in their programs as part of their 
teaching load and professional period assignments.  Emergent Bilingual students are paired with ENL or bilingual 
teachers.  This is in addition to the ENL services they receive.  Pull-out teachers access Quiz Quantification data in order to 
provide students with support in the specific skills they have not been able to master.  These teachers provide students with 
the opportunity to retake assessments after demonstrating success with the skill through the intervention.   
Additionally, MS319 uses Title III funds, Bilingual, Immigrant and other NYCDOE grants to provide students with Saturday 
programs.  These programs are designed with  specific populations in mind. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

The focus will continue to be improving the quality of instruction for Emergent Bilingual Students.  To this end the school plans 
to expose students with more English content in the areas of Social Studies and Science through ENL strategies.  The school has 
acquired simple language, trade books in English that correlate to the units of study and that can be used to introduce English 
vocabulary and language structures even as the grade-level content is mostly presented and developed in Spanish.  ENL 
teachers will continue to implement leveled lessons planned through the use of the Bilingual Common Core Progressions.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

None of the school’s bilingual programs are closing. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
MS319 uses Title III funds, Bilingual, Immigrant and other NYCDOE grants to provide students with Saturday programs.  These 
programs are designed with  specific populations in mind.  For example, on Saturdays the school offers two programs.  One of 
the programs targets Newcomers and is focused on developing mathematical prerequisites for the Common Core-aligned 
grade level curriculum in Spanish and English language skills through the use of the Middle School Units for Newcomers 
developed by the American Institute for Research.  The other program is designed to target the needs of Transitioning and 
Expanding Emergent Bilinguals who have received 3 or more years of ENL services.  This program is focused on frontloading 
mathematics content by exposing students to the skills and vocabulary that will be covered in each grade level in the following 
week as well as practicing the four language modalities in English and deepening understanding of the rubrics of academic 
language used in the NYSESLAT.  Emergent Bilingual students are also targeted for after school programs through the ELA and 
mathematics departments.  Students are selected for these programs by their content area teachers who in the case of 
Emergent Bilingual students are ENL or bilingual teachers. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          91 

 

Many instructional materials and programs are in place to support Emergent Bilinguals.  These include: MyOn reading 
program, Renaissance, Rosetta Stone in English and Spanish, USALearns English development software, Perfection Learning 
curriculum, AIR curricula, bilingual classroom libraries, Dictionaries and Thesauruses, Laptop computers available for group and 
independent work, highlighters, whiteboards, SmartBoards, instructional games, and others.  Through the use of all of these 
resources teachers are able to create meaningful, high-impact lessons that engage students with content and language 
objectives. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Students in the TBE and DL classes receive 45 minutes of HLA instruction per day, or 225 minutes per week. SIFE students and 
students with low home language literacy skills as identified from the SLab and the ELE tests also receive home language 
intervention through a pull-out program.  The HLA curriculum has been aligned to the ELA and ENL curriculum to ensure that 
students begin making connections across content.  Students are exposed to the same literacy skills (based on the CCLS) in 
both English classes and their Home Language classes.  The HLA curriculum includes quizzes, writing tasks, end-of-unit projects, 
and exams.  Additionally, students’ reading in the TBE and DL programs is supported by mandated reading of grade level 
independent reading books in English and Spanish. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Incoming students at MS319 are placed in the appropriate grade level according to their age and their last completed grade 
level as evidenced by report cards.  Instead of giving Entering and Emerging Bilingual Students low-level work, the school uses 
the Bilingual Common Core Progressions to scaffold ENL/ELA lessons that correspond to each student’s language 
level.  Additionally, these students in the TBE and DL programs receive Common Core-aligned grade level instruction in HLA 
and other content area classes in their home language.  Emergent Bilingual students in the FENL program are also exposed to 
curriculum at their grade level, regardless of English proficiency.  Through the use of the Buddy System, bilingual glossaries, 
and ENL strategies, content is made comprehensible and students are allowed multiple opportunities to succeed in all 
assessments.  The school maximizes academic pull-out, after school, and Saturday programs to assist students in catching up to 
their peers.  In this manner, they are not removed from their Core Content Areas and are receiving support in grade-level as 
well as foundational skills.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
There are a total of four schools in the former IS 90 Campus.  The Building Council, comprised of administrators from all 
schools, regularly meets in order to coordinate use of the lunch room, gymnasiums, yard, auditorium, and other common 
areas.  A schedule is created at the beginning of the school year and changes may be made for special occasions with 
approval.  The Campus also counts with a Children’s Aid Society Center in which all students may participate in afterschool, 
holiday, and summer programs.  Additionally, CSA provides Medical, Dental, and Mental health services.  They also help 
families with first needs, uniforms, and adult programs (career training, ESL classes).  All of these services are available to 
MS319’s student population and their families.  When students register for the school they are informed of CSA’s offerings. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
When families go through the enrollment process they are given a tour of the school where they meet key staff members such 
as the Assistant Principal of their grade, the School Secretary, Parent Coordinator, Bilingual Coordinator, their teachers, the 
Deans, and school counselors.  They are also introduced to the CSA staff.  Students are promptly invited to join the Saturday 
Program designed for EN/EM students in which they will receive foundational English practice as well as work on the 
mathematical prerequisites for their grade level.  Teachers promptly assign a “Buddy” to support the student through the first 
few weeks of school - teaching him/her the school processes, protocols, and culture.  This buddy is always in the same home 
language group as the Newcomer.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

At the moment, students are offered instruction in English and Spanish.  The Spanish course culminates in the SLP Spanish 
exam, through which eighth-graders accrue high school credits.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          92 

 

 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

 
The model used by the school is a self-contained program in which EPs and Emergent Bilinguals are 
integrated throughout the entire school day.  While students receive Core Content Area instruction one 
week in English and one in Spanish, they are programmed for daily ELA and HLA classes.   
ELA is always taught in English with Spanish support as needed according to students’ proficiency 
levels.  HLA is always taught in Spanish with some English support provided for students who are learning 
the target language.  Connections are made throughout both curricula in order to promote skill 
transfer.  Science, Social Studies, and Mathematics alternate between English and Spanish on a weekly 
basis.   
Students in the DL classes mostly stay in their classrooms.  These classrooms are divided into two 
sections.  On one section the boards are covered in blue paper and the books are placed in blue 
baskets.  This is the English section.  Teacher-created charts, student work, and vocabulary that is in 
English is placed in this section.  The opposite side is the Spanish side, in which Spanish items are placed 
on red backgrounds and baskets.  Additionally, teachers use blue or red markers and paper to 
differentiate the language of instruction of each week/subject.   
Since this is a middle school, there are few cases of emergent literacy instruction.  In case this need 
arises, the school would develop a simultaneous approach.  The students would be pulled out to receive 
reading intervention in each language according to their needs.    
 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
MS 319 holds five ELL specific Professional Development sessions throughout the school year. These sessions are designed and 
facilitated by the Bilingual and ENL Department.  The entire staff (including school secretaries and paraprofessionals) is 
included in all of these trainings as MS 319 agrees that all teachers are teachers of ELLs, as stated in the Blueprint for English 
Language Learner Success (NYSED, 2016). 
 
September 6th, 2017: “Preparing for Emergent Bilingual Students” 
Before the students come into the school, all teachers receive their class lists with English Proficiency levels according to the 
previous year’s NYSESLAT and current NYSITELL levels for newly admitted students. Teachers are exposed to the meaning and 
expectations of language production of each level and they are given sample questions that can be used at each 
level.  Teachers also discuss Cummin’s Quadrants (Cummins, 1984) for adjusting tasks with regards to context and cognitive 
demands.  In addition to receiving this information, teachers are trained on grouping strategies.  For example, teachers 
practice creating homogeneous and heterogeneous groups according to the demands of different learning tasks.  All of this 
information supports teacher in planning Common Core aligned tasks and lessons that are appropriate to Emergent Bilingual 
students’ language levels.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          93 

 

 
September 25th, 2017: “CR Part 154 Updates” 
All staff members are trained on the current regulations regarding the intake process for Emergent Bilingual students and 
instructional mandates for Emergent Bilinguals.  Staff members are brought up to date on the most recent regulations and 
they discuss how MS 319 is meeting these regulations.  Topics include: the intake process, SIFE identification process, parental 
information and program choice, language allocation in each program type (FENL, DL, TBE), mandated minutes per student 
according to level, the difference between integrated and standalone ENL, NYSESLAT administration every spring, Professional 
Development mandates, parent meetings, and extracurricular programs available to the Emergent Bilingual students.  Since 
the NYSESLAT has been aligned to the CCLS ELA standards, teachers are given sample questions that students may encounter 
as they improve their language proficiency.  These questions are often reflective of other Core Content Areas, which is why all 
staff members are included in the training. 
 
November 6th, 2017: “Buddy System for Writing” 
All Core Content Area departments incorporate many writing tasks into the curriculum.  In order to support Emergent Bilingual 
students and struggling writers, teachers receive training on implementing the Buddy System for Writing.  Sample 
argumentative writing tasks are provided by subject area.  Argumentative writing is selected as the task across content areas 
since it is aligned to all grade levels and the CCLS.  Teachers are asked to bring two students to practice the Buddy System at 
the training.  These students then become experts who will assist the teacher in training the entire class.   
 
January 8th, 2018: “Bilingual Common Core Progressions” 
All teachers are trained on the use of the Bilingual Common Core Progressions and their use for planning and scaffolding 
assessments.  ENL teachers demonstrate how they have used these progressions in ENL/ELA and assist Content Area Teams in 
developing CCLS-aligned lessons using this tool.  The outcomes and experiences are reflected on in the following weeks and 
the tool continues to be implemented as necessary. 
 
March 5th, 2018: “Developing Listening Skills with Emergent Bilinguals” 
All teachers are trained with different learning strategies that assist students in the  development of their listening skills.  As 
the school has noticed that listening is one of the modalities or areas in which Emergent Bilinguals need support, strategies for 
introducing text and skills through listening are presented.  Strategies such as the “Dictado”, “Telephone Game”, “Barrier 
Games”, and jigsaw activities are presented through different content areas.  Teachers have the opportunity to debrief after 
each strategy.  As Content Area teams, teachers develop a model lesson that incorporates at least one of these activities.  The 
following week, teachers reflect on the experience. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The five sessions described in the previous section ensure that a minimum of 15% of the hours of PD required for all staff 
members are focused on Emergent Bilingual students.  In addition to these sessions all Monday PD sessions include ELL-
specific teachers who focus on the needs of this particular population of students.  At these sessions, teachers meet according 
to their specific content areas to follow the “Looking at Student Work Protocol”.  MS 319 added a section into the protocol 
that specifies the misconceptions ENL and bilingual teachers sit together in around a table in order to collaborate.  The 
culminating task in these meetings is to redesign a lesson to specifically address the misconceptions or difficulties that 
students demonstrated in their work.  By collaborating, ENL and Bilingual teachers can share strategies and research that best 
supports this population of students.  Attendance is taken a t the beginning of each section by the Team Leaders.  All PD 
sessions are documented and tracked in an electronic school-wide Staff Development Plan and Log.  At the end of the school 
year, teachers receive a certificate indicating their participation in these sessions.   
All teachers, regardless of license area, who come into MS 319 for the first time are invited to a week of training before the 
beginning of the school year in order to practice the implementation of the protocols used for content delivery. 
 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          94 

 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
MS 319 uses Tuesday afternoons to meet with parents.  Parents of Emergent Bilingual students are contacted through mailings 
and phone calls by program.  First, the school makes appointments for the parents of students in the TBE program since this 
covers the majority of our ELLs.  Next, the school makes appointments for the students enrolled in the FENL program.  Lastly, 
the parents of DL students are contacted.  During these meetings, all the teachers who instruct these classes are grouped in 
the library at different tables so that parents can come to a central location to meet all of them.  At this particular meetings 
teachers meet with each parent individually and explain the growth in ENL, the modalities in which the student is strongest 
and weakest, how these modalities affect the student’s achievement in each content area, and suggestions for families to 
support their children at home. Because all the teachers are in one location, bilingual teachers are able to translate between 
parents and teachers who might need support.  In the case of arabic parents the teachers use translation software and the 
help of an English speaking family member to communicate with parents.   

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Families of Emergent Bilingual students are sent a letter every Thursday in their native language (Spanish) and English 
informing them of major school events.   There is a section of the letters in which parents write concerns and questions.  Then, 
the following week a response is sent.   
 
Parents are also offered workshops to help them in helping their children in school: 
Accessing grades online for all parents (engrade training) 
ELL buddy system PD  (October and January) 
Bilingual classroom (September – October) 
Mental Health (November) 
Technology, etc. (December, January) 
Ways to help your child in language acquisition (October - November) 
State Exams and tips for your student (March-April) 
Parents are trained on how to operate a computer, navigate the WEB and how to look for instructional activities for their 
children. 
 
The school is lucky enough to have a very active parent teacher association, which ensures parents who are present work with 
the school to get parents who are out of reach to our doorsteps. The school capitalizes on the parent’s association involvement 
to create programs and workshop around the needs of the parents in the community. For example, a large number of parents 
requested ESL classes for adults, which is something that with the collaboration of another organization the school is able to 
provide. The school has been serving parents in the community with free adult ESL classes for the past three years.   
In addition MS 319 works with the School Based Organization Children’s Aid society to provide students and their families’ 
resources that they may not be able to obtain otherwise. Children’s aid helps the community immensely in getting parents and 
their families help with counseling services, health and wellness services, etc. 
Every year, several staff members create a series of workshops where parents receive information and orientations around 
how to help their children with academics and school life regardless of language, social class or race. These workshops are 
offered in both English and Spanish and translated as well. Parents receive valuable information and introductions to 
technology and getting themselves and their child for the 21st Century, college and the work force.  The Parent Coordinator 
organizes parental activities that bring parents to school such as: 
Cultural celebrations 
Fundraisers 
Parent volunteers 
Monthly Learning Walks in which parents participate along with the principal the PTA e-board and the Parent coordinator. As 
part of these walkthrough parents are informed of what is going on in the school across the contents and grade levels. They 
are given a checklist which includes some of the components that reflect the quality review. During the walkthrough, parents

go to different classrooms and take notes based on what they see in terms of student engagement, scaffolding of instruction 
and classroom environment.  There is a debrief meeting where parents discuss their findings and plan with the principal, the 
parent coordinator and the PTA e-board moving forward.  Additionally, parents are invited to meetings and orientations 
throughout the school year (aside from parent teacher conference night) in these individual and group meeting where parents 
are informed about their child’s progress.

choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Parents of all incoming students are asked to complete the New York City Department of Education “Parent / 
Guardian Home Language Identification Survey”. Using the information gathered from the language survey and 
parent interviews, the school determines individual written translation and oral interpretation needs to ensure 
that all family members of the school community are provided with appropriate and timely information in a 
language that they can understand. There are several bilingual (Spanish, Portuguese, and French) staff who are 
designated to provide translation support, as necessary, for students and parents. The 6th grade Assistant 
principal (who speaks English, Spanish and Portuguese) oversees the ESL and bilingual department admission 
process. Additionally, the Bilingual coordinator (bilingual as well) and the Parent Coordinator collaborate as 
needed to provide translation services. The school counselor also provides translation support (Spanish) to 
families throughout the school year. In addition, there are several parent volunteers who help to facilitate 
communication with parents and family members who require translation or clarification in other languages like 
Arabic. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          99 

 

The major findings of the needs of parents within the M.S. 319 community with regard to the school's written 
translation and oral interpretation is that a majority of parents feel that our English/Spanish translations of 
newsletters, parent-teacher letters and parent reports provide appropriate opportunity for parents to keep 
informed about school curriculum, instruction, assessment and special programs. In addition, the school provides 
translations in several different languages, as needed, with changing enrollment. The school strategically pairs 
staff members in conferences, meetings and orientation programs to ensure that all parents and visitors can 
understand and participate. For example, during school orientations held at the school, different pedagogues are 
invited to serve as guides for parents and are always available to answer questions. Parent feedback, as per the 
Learning Environment Survey, each year indicate that parents are highly satisfied with all aspects of their child's 
educational program and feel that the school communicates frequently with them.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

MS 319 uses school Messenger, an automated calling system. The Parent Coordinator uploads language preferences 
into the system and records two messages (one in English and one in Spanish). Calls go out automatically by language 
preference. This system can be accessed remotely in case of emergencies. This system also has a texting feature. If 
parents activate the texting features on their phones, they will receive both English and Spanish texts with critical 
information.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

At the beginning of the school year all staff is trained on the mandated services for Emergent Bilingual students. This 
includes information about Chancellor's Regulation A-663. Additionally, this regulation is included in the staff packets 
with all current regulations. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The parent’s bill of rights Bill of rights is distributed at the beginning of the year at the initial parent meeting. 
Additionally, multilingual welcome posters are placed all over the school in the hallways. All of this information is 
shared throughout the year in the Thursday envelopes that are sent once a week every week. There are learning walk-
throughs that happen once a month conducted by the administration and the parent coordinator. All of these 
documents are sent home, and are additionally always available at parent meetings, SLT meetings, and whenever 
there is a possibility to interact with parents. The school uses the Language Access Kit and has an iPad set up in the 
office with GoogleTranslate. Although translations are imperfect, basic information can be served while the school 
contacts the Translation and Interpretation Unit for more in-depth communication over the phone. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The PTA conducts surveys where they assess the needs of the parents beyond the instructional needs of the students. 
The school uses this information to set up workshops to support the parents with those specific needs. For example: 
parents had expressed the need to learn how to access Engrade (the program the school uses to records class grades). 
A workshop was set up, parents came in, and they were given username and passwords attached to the grades of 
their individual child. Then parents were shown step by step in both English and Spanish how to access and message 
the teachers on Engrade. Another example of a need expressed by the parents was the need for adult English classes. 
The administration brought in an organization and hired certified pedagogues to teach the adult English program to

the parents in the community. As aforementioned M.S. 319 enjoys a strong parent teacher association, as a result 
there is constant communication between the needs of the parents in the community. The school most accesses the 
needs of the parents through the aforementioned PTA survey created in house. Finally, As a result of such an active 
PA, the school has high rates of completion of the city wide parent survey every year. That data is also used to cater to 
the specific needs of the parents in the community.
