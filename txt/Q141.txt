Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

 

 

Pride, achievement and commitment to excellence and old-fashioned values are the traits that make Steinway 
Intermediate School 141 a beloved middle school in Astoria. Our school boasts a commitment to providing every 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

single student who walks through our doors with a world-class education in a safe environment that is conducive to 
learning.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Our three small learning communities offer parents a partnership with the school where everyone is welcome and 
valued. Within each small academy, teachers work closely in teams to provide programs that regularly celebrate 
diversity and respect among the students in order to put an end to bullying and intolerance, which has resulted in our 
school being named a 2013 and 2014 “Respect for All” school. We are strongly committed to academic rigor, firsthand 
knowledge gained from practical hands-on experience, and a growing awareness of the world around us. This 
awareness has promoted our contributions to the needs of others both at home and abroad; each year we participate 
in various fundraisers and other philanthropic endeavors such as Pennies for Patients and Operation Santa in order to 
teach our students about the importance of giving to those in need. We participate in writing and art contests every 
year, often with great success; just this year, our students were named winners of the ABENY (Association of Black 
Educators of New York) contest and received an honorable mention for the New York City Ezra Jack Keats Bookmaking 
Competition. In addition, in accordance with the Chancellors Regulation regarding college and career readiness for all, 
our objective was to build upon our students academic strengths, leading to a successful college transition. Every 7th 
ad 8th grade class visited a college to get an understanding of future goals. Through these visits, they learned the 
importance of acquiring skills such as critical thinking,active listening, taking risks, effective communication creative 
expression and research which are necessary for their future success. As is indicative of the Framework for Great 
Schools, we have brought together the strengths of our community through our partnership with American Airlines, 
(housed in both of our local airports, LaGuardia Airport and JFK airport,) which allows our students the opportunity to 
see their STEM education applied to real life, specifically with the countless operations of an airline, including 
engineering, mechanics, sales, food service, and customer relations. It is not only the dedication of educators, 
students, and the community that have enabled us to achieve so much, but also the allegiance of parents who are 
mutually committed to the achievement of our students. We have made our greatest strides in maintaining our 
strong family-community ties. We ensure our parents are always included in their children’s education and remain 
valued partners who are informed of our goals and practices, and who always feel welcome in our school. We 
recognize that we are all vital contributors to our school’s success, and maintain the philosophy that if we continue to 
work together, we can ensure that all of our graduates are equipped with the skills necessary to be successful in 
today’s world. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have high expectations for all of our student groups, and we pay particular attention to our special education and 
ENL subgroups in order to ensure that they receive the scaffolding necessary to meet the rigorous demands outlined 
by the Next Generation Learning Standards. Our students in these subgroups receive scaffolds in the form of abridged 
texts and summaries to provide a platform for understanding complex texts, graphic organizers to assist students with 
organization, graphics and definitions to assist 2with vocabulary acquisition, and an increased focus on academic 
vocabulary in order to boost students’ overall ability to comprehend complex texts. 

Over the past year, our key area of focus has been on discussion and questioning techniques, in order to increase 
student engagement and rigor, and to improve the teachers’ abilities to assess students’ understanding. While our 
questioning techniques have improved over the course of the year, we are continuing to focus on assessment in 
instruction in order to provide feedback to increase student knowledge.

We've made the most progress in ELA student achievement as a result rigorous instruction. Through engaging 
activities, setting of high standards and motivating instruction, intellect and critical thinking skills have been fostered. 
With the introduction of lead teachers, a culture of respect and continuous improvement has been solidified. Our key 
areas of focus for this school year is building academic vocabulary/language acquisition and building inferencing skills 
through the use of Word Generation.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

  Based on analysis of the 2018 ELA results , an additional 5% of ENL students will increase their ELA 

performance as measured by an increase in the percentage of students meeting proficient levels on the New 
York State ELA Exam 
 

 
  Based on feedback from the Quality Review, teachers will work to improve class discussions to reflect higher 

levels of student thinking. 

  Based on feedback for the Quality Review Report, we will continue to build on our strength of teacher teams 

and leadership development. As per The Framework for Great Schools, teacher teams will continue to analyze 
student work and engage in curriculum refinements within a culture of respect and continuous improvement  

School's Strengths: 

At Steinway IS 141, we believe that students should be engaged in rigorous instruction and provided adequate 
assessment opportunities to ensure student understanding. We believe language acquisition is at the core of student 
success. With this idea in mind, opportunities for students conversation are abundant within the classrooms. 
Opportunities for justification, clarification, questioning and making connections help foster language acquisition and 
use of academic vocabulary.  

Instructional Focus: 

Build teacher capacity to utilize vocabulary acquisition strategies across content areas to increase students' 
comprehension and higher-order critical thinking skills that support college and career readiness. To foster 
students' language acquisition, Word Generation will be utilized throughout all content areas. Word Generation 
emphasizes how to reason analytically, finding evidence in their reading, engaging in debate, expressing thoughts 
and ideas clearly, and developing an argument, all while enhancing inferencing skills.  

Schools Weakness:  

Achievement data indicates that our students are unable to apply critical thinking skills to synthesize information. 
This inability to decipher information to infer meaning is a direct result of our students’ limited academic language 
acquisition and their need to proficiently unpack and analyze rigorous text across the content areas. 

An analysis of the 2018 June Instructional ELA Report suggests that across all grade levels students struggle to 
unpack higher-order inference questions in order to analyze various elements of the text. As a direct result of their 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

inability to unpack vocabulary, including the connotative and denotative meaning of a word, students are unable to 
derive inferential meaning from the text or the questions. Research suggests that “the relationship between 
vocabulary and reading comprehension is thought to be reciprocal, meaning that a reader who knows more words 
is likely to have better reading comprehension, while a reader who is successful with comprehension and 
frequently will have more opportunity to learn more words” (Feebody & Anderson, 1983; Stanovich, 1986). As 
such, vocabulary skills, comprehension, and inference work in unison to help us understand, process, and analyze 
texts across all content areas.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

By June 2019, the identified subgroups of ENLs, Former ENLs and SWDS will improve their language-aquisition skills as 
demonstrated by a 3% increase on the NYS ELA Exam.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

Based on the data from our Learning Environment Survey with regards to school culture, 80% of students at IS 141 
feel that there is at least one adult in the school that they can confide in, trust and be supported by. The work of our 
teachers, students, guidance counselors, social worker, psychologist, deans and administration supports success of 
students by providing a trusting environment that allows students to thrive in a challenging yet rewarding school 
setting. There is also the belief that all students should engage in rigorous common core aligned instruction that is 
geared towards our school goals and college and career readiness. By the end of this year, our goal is for an additional 
3% of students at IS 141 to have at least one staff member that they can trust and feel supported by. We can ensure 
the success of our students by learning more about who they are as individuals and making sure that they know that 
they are cared for.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, an additional 3% of our students will know of at least one staff member that they can trust, confide in 
and be supported by as measured by the learning environment survey administered at the end of the school year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In ELA, data indicates that our students are unable to apply critical thinking skills to synthesize information. This 
inability to decipher information to infer meaning is a direct result of our students’ limited academic language 
acquisition and their need to proficiently unpack and analyze rigorous text across the content areas. Only, 56.7% of 
ELA students are proficient in inferencing. Similarly, an analysis of the 2018 June Instructional Math Report reveals 
that when students are presented with mathematical computations and concepts in isolation through multiple 
choice questions, they are better able to calculate and compute accurate responses. However, when the same 
mathematical concepts are embedded in word problems requiring an analysis and dissection of ideas in 
constructed response, students have difficulty accurately answering the question and deciding which skills apply to 
the problem. There is a disparity between multiple choice and constructed response questions with only 34% of 
students achieving success in answering constructed responses.  

Our focus will be on building teacher capacity to utilize vocabulary acquisition strategies across content areas to 
increase comprehension and higher-order critical thinking skills. 

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, teachers will engage in weekly planning and inquiry study to look at multiple forms of data to improve 
instructional practices, with focus on the high leverage students and measuring their growth through common 
assessments, as evidenced by 3% increase in their benchmark assessments for all students.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

After reviewing the Frameworks for Great Schools, we believe the principal sets the tone for the school, develops a 
climate of inclusiveness, and inspires staff and students with a clear vision for student achievement. Upon analysis of 
the Learning Environment survey, 85% of our teachers had an overall positive response in relation to Effective School 
Leadership (up from 81% the previous year). As such, in an effort toward continued improvement, through continued 
teacher discussion and feedback, we will collaborate with staff to build coherent instructional and social-emotional 
support that will lead to the improvement of student achievement. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June, 2019, school leaders will create and implement a professional development plan that builds teachers' capacity 
to collaborate and create authentic lessons incorporating differentiation strategies and higher order questioning, 
resulting in an additional 3% of teachers having positive responses regarding Effective School Leadership as evidenced 
on the 2018-2019 Learning Environment Survey.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
In order to ensure that only highly qualified teachers are instructing our students, we make certain that only qualified 
licensed teachers are hired in our school. We work closely with the NYC Fellows program to ensure that qualified, 
licensed math, ELA and Special Education teachers are placed in our school. Our goal is to obtain and maintain 
teachers who are licensed and teaching appropriately. Our licensed ELA and Math coaches will continue to provide 
the support and knowledge needed to help our ELA and Math teachers boost student success. High quality 
professional development will be provided throughout the year to ensure that the staff is highly qualified. Informal 
lunches with the principal will also be available in order to discuss planning, time management strategies, assessment 
and questioning techniques.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Money has been allocated in our budget to encourage teachers to attend workshops offered by outside services such 
as NCTM, ELL QTEL, UFT Teacher Center, iReady, and District 30 Support Services. Many of our staff members also 
attend technology workshops in order to learn how to utilize the SMART Board as a means of enhancing instruction 
through technology. The Office of Instructional Technology through the NYC Department of Education provides onsite 
professional development regarding SmartBoards, pod-casting, digital film-making, and other engaging technological 
advances that can be used in the classroom. Teachers routinely attend workshops provided by the Teaching and 
Learning and Student Support Services Department of the DOE. We email our staff members regularly to alert them of 
upcoming professional developments that are available to them. CITE (Center for Teacher Education), provides our 
parents with regular informational workshops. Math and ELA teachers attend regular meetings with the math staff 
developer and and literacy AP to receive training on best practices in math and ELA and Common Core 
implementation. Informational Parent Workshops are provided monthly to familiarize parents with the new state 
standards. In addition, we explore ways in which parents can be part of their child’s academic success and offer this 
information to parents through monthly workshops, mass e-mails, and PTA meetings. Our paraprofessionals are 
participants in all onsite PD's. They also attend outside PD’s such as Professional Development for the Arts. Our 
guidance counselors attend regular meetings to learn new and innovative strategies for improving student confidence 
and overall success. Prior to the end of the school year, emails are sent to our staff with information regarding 
summer professional development opportunities.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

Finally, we guide our staff to the various opportunities available to them from the Office of Professional Development 
which include: 

● After School Professional Development 

● New Teacher Mentoring 

● Leadership Development Initiative 

● Career Training Program for Paraprofessionals (CTP) 

● Paraprofessional Summer Stipend Program

Establish professional learning communities to allow teachers the opportunity to select, analyze, adapt and create a 
wide range of pertinent instructional materials, resources and assessments to extend students’ understanding, 
making these resources available to all and also reflecting diversity beyond the classroom.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Steinway Intermediate School 141Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), is responsible for creating and implementing a 
parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the 
School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed 
members of the Steinway Intermediate School 141Q school community.  

Steinway Intermediate School 141Q’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of 
the needs of all parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with 
disabilities. Our school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent 
involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation 
through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of 
parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input.

In an effort to improve ELL performance, Steinway 141 will be offering an after school program 
for all current 6th, 7th and 8th grade ELL students to target specific needs.  The program will 
support all Next Generation Learning Standards and supplement academic instruction and 
English language acquisition for ELLs through a variety of activities in the English 
language.  This program is open to all SIFEs, LTEs, and SWD ELLs as well.  The program 
will  run on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:25 until 3:25 by 1 teacher certified in ESL and 1 
additional teacher, a seventh grade Math teacher.  The program will run from November 2018 
through May 2019. There will be 18 Wednesday sessions and 18 Thursday 
sessions.  Approximately twenty 6th, 7th and 8th grade ELL students will be attending.  There 
will be a one  combined 6th/7th/8th grade class.   Instruction will take place in English.  The 
instructional focus will be on developing their reading strategies and developing and improving 
writing skills.  The Math teacher will collaborate through a co-teaching model with the licensed 
ENL teachers to offer further support in building academic language within their subject 
areas.  Supplemental materials will be purchased with Title III funds and will include materials 
such as workbooks, manipulatives, computer software programs etc. These materials are 
different from materials offered during their regular daily instruction.    ENL teachers will 
collaborate during common planning periods throughout the week to discuss and assess 
weaknesses so that they will be able to target these needs and create a plan for after school 
instruction. Attendance in these programs will be monitored daily.  Attendance will be taken at 
each session and folders will be sent to the main office for storage and picked up everyday prior 
to the start of the program.  All program notifications will be sent to the Office of Translation 
and Interpretation Services for translation in preferred home languages and then sent home to 
parents.    
No monies are allocated for a site supervisor as supervisors are present based on contractual 
work hours.  
Title III funds will be used to enhance our ELL programs in the after school program.  This will 
enable us to meet the needs of students in targeted subgroups so that skills acquisition and 
student academic progress can be accelerated, while infusing the new National Common Core 
Learning Standards, with a focus on academic language acquisition. We have ordered resources 
to support language acquisition, including NYSESLAT Grades 6, 7, and 8 and NY Support 
Coach, STS, Target: Reading Comprehension Grades 6, 7, and 8. 
Teachers will provide supplemental instruction aligned with the Next Generation Learning 
Standards content and performance standards. Instruction will focus on literacy, fluency, and 
reading comprehension using strategies and methodologies to help ELL students acquire the 
academic English language and problem solving skills necessary for higher achievement  to 
be  evidenced by improved AMAO 2 scores on state assessments.

Begin description here:            
Workshops to implement new methodologies in language acquisition, learning styles, and 
cultural diversity are planned for professional development.  Our assistant principals, subject 
area teachers, special education and paraprofessionals attend these workshops on professional 
development days. Professional Development sessions are also offered by the ENL teachers 
during Monday PD afterschool opportunities to further supplement the 15% required 
professional development clock hours of ESL training.  Our ENL certified teachers provide 
valuable instructional strategies for ELLs.  Additionally, there are content and/or academy 
meetings that allow for interdisciplinary planning.  ENL teachers attend professional 
development sessions both in and out of our school and turn-key to all staff including special 
education teachers, guidance counselors, the school psychologist and therapists that work with 
ELLs.  Secretaries and our Parent Coordinator work closely with ENL teachers clarifying all 
avenues necessary and receive new information pertaining to ELLs.  All staff can use the internet 
to contact ENL teachers with specific questions and suggestions. Specific students are targeted 
by staff such as ENL, subject areas, Special Ed teachers, paraprofessionals and administrative 
coordinators and data driven educational plans are designed and monitored on Mondays during 
afternoon inquiry sessions, and during grade, departmental and academy meetings.  Additionally, 
CITE (Center for Integrated Technology) will provide Professional Development in such areas as 
building academic language in content areas, scaffolding strategies in the content area, and 
designing effective assessments for ELLs.    Enhancing skills, knowing strategies, and 
understanding content and how to unpack that content in ways that students can understand are 
aspects of teaching that can be learned and improved upon.  Therefore, Professional 
Development is vital towards improving the language acquisition and skills of ELLs, which in 
turn will lead to increased growth on the NYSESSLAT,  Professional Development opportunities 
stress the need to emphasize the development of oral language skills and the need to focus on 
academic language and culturally inclusive practices.  In addition, professional development will 
help teachers to become aware of the core similarities and differences between first and second 
language development and know common patterns and milestones of second language 
acquisition in order to choose materials and activities that promote language development. These 
professional development opportunities will positively impact the progress of ELLs. Teacher 
training and instructional support are an essential part of the success of both teachers and student 
achievement.

Begin description here:            
Parental Involvement is planned by the parent coordinator in conjunction with the certified ENL 
teachers.  Our parent coordinator (Stella Catechis) conducts workshops based on parents' 
suggestions and needs received through phone calls (school messenger), emails etc.  School 
correspondence related to ESL is prepared and distributed.  All written notices are translated in 
their preferred language by the Language Interpretation Department or by members of our 
faculty who are fluent in the language.  Furthermore, our Parent Coordinator calls parents of 
ELL students to inform them of upcoming events, utilizing an interpreter if necessary. 
Parents are given choices of valuable workshops and provided with opportunities to voice their 
questions and concerns.  Workshop activities provide opportunities for parents to learn how best 
they can meet the learning needs of their children in the middle school setting.  Additional 
activities, as previously described, are offered to parents to assist with learning the English 
language and provide immersion into American culture.  Various multicultural activities, such as 
our Multicultural International Food Festival and Multicultural Dance Productions also allow 
parents to familiarize themselves with the American culture and allows students to showcase 
their pride in their nationalities.  Title III funds have been set aside for  these parental 
engagement activities.   
Various workshops throughout the 2018-2019 school year include:

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school utilizes Baseline Exams, i-Ready, online Performance Series assessments and teacher-created assessments. The 
collected data provides insight into a child's lexile level and allows the school to utilize skill-specific strands to study trends in 
learning and growth and to individualize instruction. Additionally, we utilize collected data to select curriculum texts and 
independent reading texts.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Our school programmer coordinates block time to allow students to complete these common assessments.  Common planning 
time is scheduled to allow teachers to score, analyze and discuss trends and common misconceptions based on feedback from 
these assessments. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our school’s ENL programs is measured by our students’ rise in levels on baseline exams, interim assessments, 
state exams and the NYSESLAT. We have shown continuous progress, and approximately TBD% of our ENL population scored a 
proficiency level in 2017 and TBD% in 2018, allowing students to be mainstreamed. Students with proficient scores on the 
NYSESLAT receive transitional services and are given continued ENL testing accommodations for two years after scoring 
"Proficient/Commanding" on the NYSESLAT. 1 seventh grade student scored a level 3 on the ELA and an Expanding on the 
NYSESLAT, and was therefore, mainstreamed with the required support services. (THIS DATA WILL BE UPDATED WHEN 
RESULTS OF NYSESLAT ARE RELEASED) 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Common planning time is built in our school program to analyze student results.  Once determinations are made, interventions 
are addressed within the classrooms through differentiate instruction techniques.  In addition, teachers collaborate with the 
AIS teachers so that they, too, can address specific needs during their scheduled periods with the class.  Also, our ENL 
coordinator was hired as a model teacher to facilitate instruction to target areas in need of improvement.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Not applicable.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Students in the sixth grade scored higher levels than grades 7 and 8, since 100% of sixth graders scored in the top two levels 
(commanding/expanding).Less than 20% of 7th graders scored commanding in 2015.  However, the majority of students 
scored at the top two levels. There is a decreasing trend of scores that correlates to the proficiency level.  78% of eighth grade 
students scored at the top two levels (commanding/expanding). Very few were in the transitioning phase.  The balance are 
negatively skewed toward the two lowest levels.  (THIS DATA WILL BE UPDATED WHEN RESULTS OF NYSESLAT ARE RELEASED) 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Our teachers meet during our Professional Learning Cycles on Monday afternoons to disseminate these findings and to 
research strategies to implement within the classroom.  In addition, our ESL teachers meet with the ELA model/master 
teachers once a week to discuss trends/noticings/misconceptions within their classrooms. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

I.S. 141 Q provides for one heterogeneously grouped ESL self-contained, freestanding (100% English) block classes for 
each grade (6th, 7th and 8th grades). ELL students who are in a monolingual setting and mandated for ESL receive 
services through push-in instruction by certified ESL teachers in accordance with NCLB. All students whose IEP 
mandates ESL related services who are seated in a special education class or an inclusion class receive the required 
instruction in accordance with NCLB CR Part -154 regulations through team- teaching/pull-out by certified ESL 
teachers. The 6th, 7th, and 8th grades are programmed as self-contained classes and travel in groups throughout the 
day according to their program. Furthermore, these classes are heterogeneous with mixed proficiency levels

according to NYSITELL and latest NYSESLAT scores. In addition, the certified ESL teachers team-teach and pull-out to 
accommodate Special Education students who are mandated to receive ESL services as per IEPs and BESIS. Instruction 
is individualized for students of all proficiency levels.  
Grade 6 students in the ENL self-contained class receive instruction from a licensed ENL teacher, Alexandria Grosso 
who also holds a CBT license.  They receive at least 360 minutes of ENL/ELA services per week as well as 225 minutes 
of social studies.  Students in grade six whose IEP mandates ESL related services who are seated in a special education 
class or an inclusion class receive the required instruction in accordance with NCLB CR Part – 154.2 regulations 
through pull-out services by Ms. Grosso.  
Student in grade six who passed the NYSESLAT given in 2015 and 2014 receive 90 minutes of integrated core through 
pull-out services rendered by Ms. Grosso who holds a dual license. 
Grade 7 students in the ENL self-contained class receive at least 360 minutes of ENL services from Mr. Geist, a 
licensed ENL teacher, and 180 minutes of social studies weekly.  These students also receive 90 minutes of integrated 
math since Mr. Geist co-teaches with math teachers for 2 periods each week.  Students in grade seven whose IEP 
mandates ESL related services who are seated in a special education class or an inclusion class receive the required 
instruction in accordance with NCLB CR Part – 154.2 regulations through pull-out /push in services by Mr. Geist. 
Students who passed the NYSESLAT in years 2014 and 2015 receive 90 minutes of services through pull-out/push in 
services also rendered by Mr. Geist.  
Grade 8 students in the ENL self-contained class receive at least 360 minutes of ENL services from Mr. Geist, and 225 
minutes of social studies instruction from Ms. Grosso. Students in grade eight whose IEP mandates ESL related 
services who are seated in a special education class or an inclusion class receive the required instruction in 
accordance with NCLB CR Part – 154.2 regulations through pull-out/push in services by Mr. Geist. Those students who 
passed the NYSESLAT in 2014 and 2015 are rendered transitional services of 90 minutes per week through pull-

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

            The mandated number of instruction minutes is delivered as follows: Program Instruction Component for ELLs, Grades

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
    Core Content are delivered 100% in English to align with the requirements of Freestanding ESL instruction. To ensure 
comprehension and enrich language development in the content areas, ESL methodologies are used. All students are grouped 
appropriately and instructed in accordance with NCLB CR Part 154. The teachers are continuously assessing with the purpose 
of driving instruction that is conducive to individual student needs. The students are gradually moved (flexible grouping) as 
their needs change linguistically, academically, socially, and emotionally. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   A running log of home languages is kept on file with the administration and the teachers of ELLs.  It is regularly updated to 
account for newly admitted students.  This file is used to ensure that ELLs are provided with translated assessments when 
available.                                 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a.     Differentiated instruction is implemented for the ELL subgroup, SIFE, by providing for learning buddies, multiples texts, 
small group instruction and adjusting questions according to Webb's Depth of Knowledge Circle with emphasis on Levels 3 and 
4. SIFE students are initially assessed in content areas and evaluated. Class assignments and homework are then modified to 
meet their needs and assist them to build confidence through academic success. SIFE students are strongly encouraged to 
attend Saturday and after school programs that include language arts, math, social studies, science and an array of enrichment 
programs such as “Chess Club” so that they can progress to grade level. We also provide small group instruction throughout 
the day utilizing software technology on individual laptops. Extracurricular activities and trips are planned to provide for lack of 
prior knowledge. Parents are encouraged to assist their children with visits to the local libraries. Students in this category who 
are required to take exams, are provided with testing accommodations as outlined in the CR-154.2as follows: extension of 
time, separate location, third reading of the NYS ELA listening section, bilingual glossaries providing one-to-one translated 
words (except for  the NYS ELA Assessment), simultaneous use of English and alternative language editions for state exams 
(except the NYS ELA Assessment) for which SED provides written translations, and oral translations of low incident languages 
except again for the NYS ELA Assessment.  Also, students making use of alternative language editions or of oral translations of 
state examinations may write their responses to the open-ended questions I their home language (except for the NYS ELA 
Assessment).   
  
  b.     For ELL newcomers who have been in the United States for fewer than three years, methodologies are utilized which 
emphasize the most basic and effective strategies in intensive English learning, such as Q-Tel strategies. Students are 
individually assessed using data collection, teacher made materials, conferencing, and professional observation on an on-going 
basis. Differentiated instruction will be implemented using learning buddies, multiple texts leveled to their ability according to 
lexile levels determined by the Performance Series, and small group instruction. Additionally, ESL instruction is aligned to the 
pacing calendar for the grade appropriate ELA curriculum and the Common Core Learning Standards to address ELLs who are 
here more than one year and who will take the ELA exam. Further practice opportunities are provided during class and during 
the 50 minute instructional program. Audio libraries are essential to ELL instruction for newcomers. Students in this category 
who are required to take exams will receive the testing accommodations as outlined in the CR-154.2 as follows: extension of 
time, separate location, third reading of the NYS ELA listening section, bilingual glossaries providing one-to-one translated 
words (except for  the NYS ELA Assessment), simultaneous use of English and alternative language editions for state exams 
(except the NYS ELA Assessment) for which SED provides written translations, and oral translations of low incident languages 
except again for the NYS ELA Assessment.  Also, students making use of alternative language editions or of oral translations of 
state examinations may write their responses to the open-ended questions I their home language (except for the NYS ELA 
Assessment).   
  
c.     The ELL subgroup that is developing has been identified and will continue to receive differentiated instruction through 
independent study and flexible grouping. Multiple supplementary materials will be constructed by certified ESL teachers in 
addition to graphic organizers to support learning. Students will be challenged with leveled readers and academic language. 
The focus of instruction will involve the building of vocabulary through academic language across the curriculum as developed 
within team planning. Students in this category who are required to take exams will receive testing accommodations as 
outlined in the CR-154.2 as follows: extension of time, separate location, third reading of the NYS ELA listening section, 
bilingual glossaries providing one-to-one translated words (except for  the NYS ELA Assessment), simultaneous use of English 
and alternative language editions for state exams (except the NYS ELA Assessment) for which SED provides written 
translations, and oral translations of low incident languages except again for the NYS ELA Assessment.  Also, students making 
use of alternative language editions or of oral translations of state examinations may write their responses to the open-ended 
questions I their home language (except for the NYS ELA Assessment).   
  
d.     Long-term ELLS that have completed 6 years or more are a subgroup that has been identified and receives differentiated 
instruction continuously through multiple texts and skill-based mini-lessons. Students participate in activities that promote 
academic discourse such as accountable talk. In addition, teachers use a wide range of print, digital resources, and 
SMARTBoards designed for interactive lessons for developing English. Students will be encouraged to explore other avenues to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

expand their vocabulary. Classroom tested activities will include crossword puzzles, matching columns, word finds, riddles and 
more. These resources are motivating and target individual and group formats. They will continue to support and motivate 
learning as highlighted above. These students will also be able to log into The New York Times Replica Edition to further 
challenge themselves and increase sophisticated language acquisition. Students in this category will receive testing 
accommodations as outlined in the CR-154.2 as follows: extension of time, separate location, third reading of the NYS ELA 
listening section, bilingual glossaries providing one-to-one translated words (except for  the NYS ELA Assessment), 
simultaneous use of English and alternative language editions for state exams (except the NYS ELA Assessment) for which SED 
provides written translations, and oral translations of low incident languages except again for the NYS ELA Assessment.  Also, 
students making use of alternative language editions or of oral translations of state examinations may write their responses to 
the open-ended questions I their home language (except for the NYS ELA Assessment).   
  
e.     All former ELLs up to two years after receiving services and thereafter continue to receive data-driven individualized 
instruction in all content areas with a special emphasis on continued English Language Acquisition and intensive vocabulary 
development.  Increasingly more complex text selections are made for these students and scaffolded support is provided by 
teachers across the content areas. In compliance with the CR Part 154.2, these students are also provided with 90 minutes of 
integrated ENL/core each week to provide them with additional support. Testing accommodations are provided to these 
students and as outlined in the CR-154.2 are as follows: extension of time, separate location, third reading of the NYS ELA 
listening section, bilingual glossaries providing one-to-one translated words (except for  the NYS ELA Assessment), 
simultaneous use of English and alternative language editions for state exams (except the NYS ELA Assessment) for which SED 
provides written translations, and oral translations of low incident languages except again for the NYS ELA Assessment.  Also, 
students making use of alternative language editions or of oral translations of state examinations may write their responses to 
the open-ended questions I their home language (except for the NYS ELA Assessment).   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
In order to meet the diverse need of ELL-SWDs, a push-in/team teaching approach is utilized.  Instruction for ELLs is co-planned 
bythe ESL, ELA and Special Education teachers at weekly planning meetings with the ELA Assistant Principal. Unit plans and 
individual lessons are designed by the grade team to provide multiple entry points for learning to students at varying ability 
levels and with challenges both with language and learning. Strategies such as Power Paragraphing, A-N-T and F.E.T.C.H are 
utilized across the content areas in order to assist ELLs with writing and comprehension. Tasks and rubrics are examined for 
fairness and alignment to the Common Core. Vocabulary is pre-screened for ELL-SWD students with special attention to 
prefixes, roots and suffixes. Teachers utilize technology such as smartboards, ipads and laptops to further ensure multiple 
entry points for learning have been provided. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Students with disabilities are programmed flexibly based on their IEP program recommendations and the required number of 
minutes of ESL instruction based on their NYSESLAT proficiency scores.  In addition, the certified ESL teachers team-teach, pull-
out and parallel teach to accommodate Special Education students who are mandated to receive ESL services as per IEPs and 
BESIS.  All instruction in English/ESL is co-planned with ESL and ELA teachers at weekly team meetings with the assistant 
principal in charge of ELA.  Instruction is aligned to the Common Core curriculum and IEP goals for individual students. 
An IEP team determines a student’s eligibility for special education services and the language in which special education 
programs and services are delivered. ELLs who are also students with disabilities (SWD) receive accommodations that apply 
both to ELLs and SWDs, as appropriate. ELLs with disabilities must receive the required level of ELL services, although program 
placement and parental option procedures may be different for special education programs and services, and are facilitated by 
the Committee for Special Education during IEP meetings. All students with disabilities have a re-evaluation every three years, 
and an annual review of their IEPs.  The ENL teacher providing services to the student as well as other teachers presents 
observations and information concerning the child’s progress to the IEP team.  In this way, any changes to the IEP can be 
considered in view of the child’s progress in both special education classes and English as a second language acquisition.     
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
One particular ELL subgroup that has been targeted is the long-term ELLs. The AMAO tool determined the long-term ELLs were 
the quotient at risk. 18 ELL students with 5-6 years of service, and 3 ELLs with 2 or more years of service scored in the first 
quartile in the NYSESLAT.  A total of 34 "at risk" students are ELLs.  A range of intervention services are rendered in both ELA 
and mathematics.   Long-term ELLs are grouped to work on challenging activities with focus to increase all existing strengths 
and address weaknesses. Choice of activities are offered for students who want to be challenged with ideas for multi-genre 
pieces, such as journals, book- talks, speeches, literary letters, expository reports and poetry. Cognitive strategies are practiced 
through cooperative learning and teacher modeling. Students will use more graphic organizers, make visual associations and 
specific connections between new and old learning. Students must achieve more comfort in speaking English and continue to 
build their academic language. They have the opportunities to create dialogues and recite authentic literature. Our S.S. and 
Science teachers utilize support strategies to ensure language, understanding of concepts and vocabulary. QTEL strategies are 
incorporated and visuals are utilized throughout the learning process. In addition, the Performance Series is utilized to 
determine lexile levels and improvement.  Instruction is data driven using classroom observations, classroom generated tests, 
tasks, results of the baseline, benchmarks and the ELA tests. 
Mathematics programs support individualization by utilizing math games designed by our Lead Teacher in the XP Math 
Program.  To support vocabulary development, teachers pre-teach in small groups and use resources such as Buzzmath, XP 
Math, Plickers, Understanding Math and BrainPOP, and i-Ready.  Teachers also use manipulatives such as algebra tiles, 
rulers/protractors and calculators.  Instruction is data driven by utilizing resources such as Schoolnet and NYSTP. Further 
support is rendered by Mr. Geist who pushes-in to the math classes of subject specialists, Mr. Hui and Ms. Grosso once a 
week.  
In addition, all seventh and eighth grade students who are not placed in honor class will receive at least one period of AIS Math 
and AIS ELA each week in the 2017-2019 school year.  (THIS INFORMATION AND DATA WILL BE UPDATED WHEN RESULTS OF 
NYSESLAT ARE RELEASED and 2018-2019 schedule is finalized) 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are currently revamping our Expeditionary Learning literacy units for the 2015 - 2016 school year. Immersion in this ELA 
curriculum with pieces which roll-up and become refined with each new school year promises to provide the necessary rigor 
and scaffolds necessary to support our ELLs. Another new program we will implement this year is Waggle in order to assist ELLs 
with strengthening language acquisition modalities. An assistant principal, Ms. Maroulis, will continue to support the ESL 
providers with meeting the curricular standards and Common Core Learning Standards for ELA. We have contracted the CITE 
consulting group to provide further support to our certified ELL teachers. We will investigate other outside support agencies if 
funding permits. Our ESL teachers are consulting ATS and Skedula to create data reports to further enhance student learning in 
all content areas. Additionally, ELA baseline and predictive exams will be used to measure progress and drive instruction. Data 
collection and analysis will be a continued focus of attention to further adjust student grouping and differentiation of class 
instruction and homework. In addition, much emphasis is being placed on encouraging students to select "just-right" texts 
from leveled classroom libraries as per their lexile levels established using  the Performance Series. Teachers will assess the 
reading levels of their students twice per year in order to monitor the progress being made throughout the school year. 
Leveled classroom libraries (according to the Performance Series) have been replenished and the wider selection of books 
allows our students to read independently on their actual reading level, therefore providing multiple resources for student 
levels. The New York Times Replica Edition can be utilized by students to further enhance language acquisition. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

At this time, there are no plans to discontinue any services or programs for ELLs.                            
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are afforded equal access through our Title III school programs. Title III provides small group instruction. Title III 
programs support all Common Core standards and supplement academic instruction through a variety of activities. ELL 
students are invited to participate in all after school clubs, such as Band, Chess and Cheerleader Club, and ENL classes are 
visited by teachers who supervise clubs in order to present the nature of the club and invite students to participate. Parents of 
ELLs are invited to all workshops present by our Parent Coordinator at which she explains the options for extra-curricular 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

activities for ELLs and other students.    Many of our extra-curricular clubs support literacy skills to further enhance learning for 
ELLs.  
ENL students also participate in all celebrations including, but not limited to, Student of the Month Assemblies, Breakfast with 
the Assistant Principal, school performances, and the Multi-Cultural Celebration. ENL students participate in subject honor 
rolls, assistant principal’s honor roll, the principal’s honor roll, and the National Junior Honor Society of which IS 141Q is a 
member. All trips such as Dining Down Ditmars, museum, college and high school visits include ELLs as does the Honor 
Society’s overnight trip, open to any student in the Honor Society.   
We currently offer an after- school program specifically for English language learners to provide intensive instruction in 
reading. Instruction is delivered by a certified ESL teacher and a co-teacher. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 All selected text books contain ELL specific sections and strategies which address ESL methodologies and assessment.  Many of 
the textbooks also contain CD ROMS which provide visuals to deepen understanding in the content areas.  SMART Boards are 
utilized to provide interactive instruction and to engage students visually. We have a one-to-one laptop/iPad ratio for our ELL 
students to access multiple learning programs such as XP Math, Rosetta Stone, Mind Jogger, Brain Pop, Free Rice, The New 
York Times Replica Edition, Khanacademy.org, United Streaming,  Bookshare, Math Forum and many other challenging and fun 
websites. Our school library website (http://library.nycenet.edu) is available for our students to access various databases 
which provide more resources for research, practice and assessment.  Manipulatives are utilized to facilitate the learning 
process in order to provide a more concrete method of acquiring skills and knowledge within the content areas.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In order to offer native language support, we pair students and buddy them based on native language. Additionally, we 
provide native language reading materials in our classroom libraries to engage students in native literary activities. Specific 
areas have been designated in the classroom libraries with bilingual books, both in Spanish and Arabic, two of the most 
requested languages. We have dual language glossaries, dictionaries and thesauruses. We encourage newcomers to continue 
activities in their native languages and accordingly monitor their transition to English. Some of our students utilize electronic 
hand-held translation modules to facilitate learning.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Each ESL and special education classroom has a plethora of reading and writing materials, and teachers utilize strategies to 
satisfy every possible learner’s level corresponding to appropriate ages and grade levels. These required services support and 
supplement the strategies implemented in the classes. Class libraries are leveled according the lexile levels, and sorted 
according to genre for ease of student selection. Students are instructed to use all resources and artifacts in the classroom. 
Students visit our school library to select books of interest.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 All selected text books contain ELL specific sections and strategies which address ESL methodologies and assessment.  Many of 
the textbooks also contain CD ROMS which provide visuals to deepen understanding in the content areas.  SMART Boards are 
utilized to provide interactive instruction and to engage students visually. We have a one-to-one laptop/iPad ratio for our ELL 
students to access multiple learning programs such as XP Math, Rosetta Stone, Mind Jogger, Brain Pop, Free Rice, The New 
York Times Replica Edition, Khanacademy.org, United Streaming,  Bookshare, Math Forum and many other challenging and fun 
websites. Our school library website (http://library.nycenet.edu) is available for our students to access various databases 
which provide more resources for research, practice and assessment.  Manipulatives are utilized to facilitate the learning 
process in order to provide a more concrete method of acquiring skills and knowledge within the content areas.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).

ELLs. Parents are encouraged to attend parent workshops and to get to know their parent liaison for any further questions. 
Parent liaisons include the assistant principal in charge of ENL, Elisa Barresi, the asssistant principal in charge of special 
education, Lori Adamo, guidance counselors, Heather Mullahy and Diane Christopher, and the parent coordinator, Stella 
Catechis. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Last year ELL student were offered Spanish and/or Greek. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

.At this time, we do not have a dual language program.   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
ENL Teachers, George Geist and Alexandria Grosso receive feedback support and professional development provided by CITE; 
additionally, all ENL teachers participate in Common Core professional development and weekly professional development and 
feedback meetings provided by our master and model literacy teachers. ELL personnel receive constant instructional feedback 
based on the Danielson Rubric as it applies to general instruction and instruction for ELLs.   
The school will provide professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs of 
English language learners. A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers 
prescribed by CR Part 80 will be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching 
strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.  
Assistant principal of ESL, Elisa Barresi, and Assistant Principal of ELA, Steven Tenaglia, will attend professional learning 
seminars throughout the year  and will  turnkey pertinent information to our other assistant principals, Lori Adamo, Vanessa 
Williams. 
She also turnkeys information to all staff members including but not limited to subject area specialists, guidance counselors, 
Ms. Mullahy and Ms. Christopher, ENL model teacher, George Geist, speech therapists, the parent coordinator, Ms. Catechis, 
common branch teachers, paraprofessionals and the school psychologist. 
A workshop focusing on strategies to support acquisition of tier III and tier IV words by ELL students will again be  hosted by 
George Geist for all members of staff. 
The upcoming ELA area specialists for the 2018-2019 year and George Geist, will be scheduled to attend professional 
development addressing co-teaching strategies.  Again, they will turnkey this information, and all professionals and para-
professionals in the building will be invited to attend. 
No provision is made for bilingual teachers since the school does not offer either a bilingual or dual language program.   
All teachers are considered teachers of ELLs and/or former ELLs; as a result, all teachers receive professional development in 
the use of ESL support strategies across the content areas. All Common Core curriculum is scaffolded by content area teams in 
consultation with ESL teachers to provide multiple entry points of learning to our ESL students; professional development in 
this type fo scaffolding is provided by our master/model teachers and via turn-key teachers who participate in Network-based 
professional development.  We will continue to attend Professional Development sessions offered by our Queens North 
support specialist.  We will continue to work closely with the ELL specialist for out district in order to continue to provide on-
going professional learning to all teachers of ELLs.

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our 6th grade academy is a transition academy to support students who are coming from elementary schools and are 
transitioning to a departmentalized structure for the first time. As a result, our staff receives professional development to 
assist all students and specifically ELLs to transition smoothly. Our guidance counselors receive professional development in 
order to assist ELLs with transition to the middle school. ELL students are provided with organizational tools (such as agenda 
planning books and folders), and teacher provide hands-on instruction to students in order to open them up to skills which 
differ in the middle school setting. 
Guidance counselors received professional development from our Assistant Principal addressing changes to the CR-154 and its 
appendixes 
Professional development as required by CR Part 154.2 is provided at I. S. 141Q on designated school days (Mondays and 
Professional Learning Cycle Days), and workshops outside the school during the summer and evening hours are made available 
to all teaching staff. Workshops to implement new methodologies in language acquisition, learning styles, and cultural 
diversity are planned for professional development. Our assistant principals, common branch, subject area teachers, special 
education and paraprofessionals attend these workshops on professional development days. Lunch and Learn sessions are also 
offered by the ESL teachers to further supplement the required minimum for ESL-specific training. Our ESL certified teachers 
provide valuable instructional strategies for ELLs. Additionally, there are content and/or academy meetings that allow for 
interdisciplinary planning. ESL teachers attend professional development sessions both in and out of our school and turn-key 
to all staff including special education teachers, guidance counselors, the school psychologist and therapists that work with 
ELLs. Secretaries and our Parent Coordinator work closely with ESL teachers clarifying all avenues necessary and receive new 
information pertaining to ELLs. All staff can use the internet to contact ESL teachers with specific questions and suggestions. 
Specific students are targeted by staff such as ESL, subject areas, Special Ed teachers, paraprofessionals and administrative 
coordinators and data driven educational plans are designed and monitored weekly on Mondays, and during grade, 
department and academy meetings. Parents also have the opportunity to join the school PTA to further enable them to 
familiarize themselves with the school their children attend daily. The following topics have been and will be addressed: 
a.     New methodologies in language acquisition 
b.     Learning styles 
c.     Cultural diversity 
d.     Developing technology for ELL 
e.     What is the NYSESLAT? 
f.     Cross-Age/Peer tutoring 
g.     Interdisciplinary planning 
h.     Performance Series 
i.     QTEL tools and strategies 
j.     Data collection and analysis 
k.     Differentiated instruction 
l.     Effective use of ARIS 
m.     SMART Boards and English Language Learners 
Logs of all professional development and attendees are stored in binders in our school. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
School professionals will individually meet with the parents or guardians of English language learners at least once a year, in 
addition to parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled meetings 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

 

 

provided for parents or guardians, to discuss the goals of the program, their child’s language development progress, their 
child’s English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. This additional 
meeting will include school staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the child’s language 
development in all content areas in English. Professionals will include, but not be limited to the child’s ENL teacher, George 
Geist or Alexandria Grosso, and the licensed subject area specialist at minimum.  As need arises, any of the following will be 
available for the meeting: the school psychologist, the bilingual guidance counselor, Ms. Christopher, guidance counselor, Ms. 
Mullahy, Ms. Barresi, A.P. in charge of ENL or Ms. Adamo, A.P. in charge of special education.  Such meeting will be conducted 
in the parent’s preferred language by utilizing on site staff named in answer to Part IV, question 1 or by contacting the 
Translation and Interpretation Unit.  Teachers are available for over an hour all Tuesdays when school is in 
session.  Appointments with parents will be made during this time. If a parent is unable to attend, a mutually convenient 
appointment will be made in accordance with the collective bargaining agreements.   Mr. Geist and Ms. Grosso, ENL teachers 
will be responsible for keeping a list of all parents seen including the date and time of the appointment and matters 
discussed.  In order to collect sufficient meaningful data on the students appointments will begin taking place during the 
second marking period, after parent/teacher conferences i.e. the beginning of December, unless it is determined that the 
needs of the child would best be served by an earlier conference.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parental Involvement is planned by the parent coordinator in conjunction with the certified ESL teachers. We offer workshops 
in such areas as building positive behavior and self-esteem in children, after-school programs and middle school options, and 
safety of students in and outside of school. Workshops also address good practices for ELL students to succeed in school. 
Additional workshops are scheduled to inform parents how to provide academic assistance and support to their child's 
learning including homework help, study practices and test-taking. Parents are invited to attend events which celebrate 
cultural diversity and respect for all.  Interactive student projects are designed to engage students in conversations about their 
learning with their parents.  
Language support is provided for parents in need by a staff member as named in Part IV, Question 1 or by contacting the 
Translation and Interpretation Unit.

Policy and Reference Guide, I, Miranda Pavlou, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

A member of our school staff interviews the parents of new registrants at the time of registration, and documents 
their language needs. 

The parents’ language preference is written on the emergency cards located in the main office, dean’s office and 
the nurse’s office. This is done within 30 days of a student’s enrollment. In addition all homeroom teachers 
compiled lists of the home language preference of the parents of every student already registered in their 
homeroom classes. These lists are in the possession of the homeroom teachers, the school coordinator, the 
parent coordinator, the main office, the duplicating room, all guidance counselors and assistant principals. In 
addition, this information has been inputted onto ATS. 

Our parent coordinator also communicates the need for translators and oral interpreters. Translators and 
interpreters are provided for parent – teacher conferences, and parent workshops. Every staff member is aware 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

of the new initiative to collect and document the native languages of every family with a child enrolled in this 
school in order to translate any and all correspondence between home and school. This information is updated 
every time a new student is registered. 

Additionally, we collect data is from ATS Report of Preferred Languages, Blue Card Data, Parent Surveys and 
Teacher Surveys. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
