Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Our mission is to help educationally under-served students in District 16 achieve academic excellence by developing 
content mastery, strong character, and creative expression through the arts along with building habits and skills that 
prepare them for college and beyond..  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

OUR STRUCTURE: 

Vision and Mission 

M.S. 57 is a proud Creative Arts school open to all student in District 16. We are driven by a common vision and 
mission, a commitment to Growing Minds and Building Futures for all of our students, and believe that if we help 
children strive for Excellence, develop academic Mastery, strong Character, and Creativity that these qualities will 
help them be successful in high school, college and beyond.  

OUR APPROACH: 

High Expectations: 

We set measurable and attainable expectations for academic excellence and behavior in order to promote and 
sustain a culture of high achievement and support for all students. We know that every student is unique and we 
design learning experiences based on students' needs, skills, and interests. 

Rigorous Curriculum and Instruction: 

Building strong minds require that all students achieve at high academic levels. To prepare students with 21st Century 
skills and content knowledge they need to be successful in college, life and beyond, Middle School 57's teachers 
deliver high quality, rigorous curriculum and instruction in every classroom. By engaging students in standards based 
learning experiences and monitoring academic progress, MS 57's teachers know what their students' needs are and 
can customize instruction to address them.  

Culture of Positivity, Achievement and Support: 

We believe college is an attainable goal for all of our students. Success in the future, in college and beyond, will 
depend on how we prepare them now. We strongly believe that creating learning experiences where students are 
Friendly, Leaders, Organized, Positive and of Service to others is key to opening doors to a brighter future for them, 
their families and communities. 

STUDENT LIFE 

Explicit Instruction and Personalized Learning: 

M.S. 57's teachers blend explicit instruction and personalized learning to meet all students' needs, help them take 
ownership of their learning, and continuously grow.  

Time for Academics, Creative Arts, and Physical Education: 

Students in our school explore and learn from start to finish. They are exposed to the creative arts (dance, theater and 
visual art), extracurricular, and physical education activities that offer them unique opportunities to tap their interests 
and full potential.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Character: 

We aspire to build strong character in every M.S. 57 student. We know that strong character is an essential ingredient 
to academic success.  

Independent Thinking: 

M.S. 57 students, over the course of their time here, learn that independent thinking is key to personal success in 
school and beyond. M.S. 57 students grow as independent thinkers by learning how to ask questions and seek 
answers that make sense. 

Effective Communication between Staff, Students, and Families: 

Central to our students' success is effective communication. Building strong relationships with families, student and 
staff are an indispensable part of our work. Acknowledging and honoring student voice, parent voice and community 
voice sends a clear message that we see and value all relationships. 

Time for Enrichment and Extracurricular Activities: 

M.S. 57 students explore interests and develop creativity in classes like Visual Art, Dance and Theater/Drama. In 
addition to core classes, our wide range of electives and extracurricular activities give our students a well-rounded 
and enriching middle school experience.  

Social-Emotional and Leadership Development: 

Students learn how to manage their emotions and make good decisions. We believe every student can lead which 
starts with leading oneself first. We give students opportunities to take the lead in various aspects of their schooling 
experience.  

College Bound Learning and Preparation: 

M.S. 57 students always have their eyes on the prize when it comes to looking ahead. College is the goal! M.S. 57 
students talk about college, visit colleges and develop an academic road map that helps them see the path to college 
more clearly starting in middle school.  

WHAT ELSE MAKES M.S. 57 DIFFERENT? 

Our Special Initiatives and Partnerships: (1) College Access for All, (2) Positive Behavior Intervention Support Culture, 
(3) 100 School Project, (4) Literacy 360, (5) Charter District Partnership, (6) LightSail Summer Readers Institute, (7) 
Debate, (8) MSQI, (9) MBK Boys Who Read, (10) SHSAT, (11) Wraparound Day Program with New York Edge, (12) 
Advisory, (13) ELA WIN (literacy intervention), (14) Math WIN (math skill intervention), (15) Spirit Afternoon, (16) 
Algebra for All, (17) Restorative Practices, (18) New York Edge After-school Program, (19) Empire After-school 
Program, (20) Community Service, (21) Stimulating Minds through Entrepreneurship and Leadership, (22) Student 
Government. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We currently have 33% percent of our students classified as Student with Disabilities and 8% classified as English 
Language Learners. Based on trends and patterns in our school data (NYSED) for 2017-2018, 98% of our Students with 
Disabilities are non-proficient in ELA and 94% are non-proficient in Mathematics. The data implies that we need to 
change our instructional methods in order to increase the number of SWDs approaching/meeting proficient levels in 
both ELA and Math. We intend to focus on implementing more explicit forms/methods of instruction to ensure strong 
development of procedural and conceptual understanding of standard based content. In addition, we plan to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

implement a more effective progress monitoring system that provides teaches with immediate feedback on next 
steps in lesson instruction or adjustment to meet students' needs in the next lesson. Lastly, we plan to administer 
standard based cumulative mastery assessments at the end of each unit to all SWDs.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

We made progress in four out of five elements of the Framework for Great Schools. Based on the 2017-18 School 
Quality Guide, Rigorous Instruction (score 4.49), Collaborative Teachers (4.07), Strong Family-Community Ties (3.34) 
and Trust (3.48) were the elements we made progress in.  

Our areas of focus this year, 2018-2019, are Effective Leadership, Rigorous Instruction and Strong Family-Community 
Ties. Our school Instructional focus is Engaging Students in Learning and our focus/Priority is building teacher 
competence around designing and delivering a curriculum that challenges and engages students in rigorous learning 
experiences that increase students' procedural and conceptual competence. In addition , we will be leveraging the 
School Leadership Team and the Parent-Teacher Association to ensure that parents know what the school's areas of 
focus are and what structures are in place to support the attainment of this year's goals.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Our school strengths include: 

  Teachers collaborating to reflect on unit plans, lessons, instructional practices, and data to reflect and revise 

curriculum to infuse rigor in the design of activities and tasks. 

  Teacher engage in vertical Teacher Team work focused on unpacking non-mastered standards, identifying 

students' learning gap, and preparing re-teach sessions to address learning needs. 

  Teachers participating in Rehearsal where they practice delivering of explicit instruction through a model 

focus on building procedural and conceptual understandings in students. 

  Teachers participate in instruction based clinics that support the building of competency in effective lesson 

planning and delivery. 

  Teachers engage in Grade Team meetings to share data about students in order to support students academic 

and behavioral development.  

  Teacher teach a standard based curricula and administer standard based cumulative mastery assessments at 

the end of every unit. 

  Math and ELA/HUM teachers participate in literacy and math skills intervention sessions with all students 

(6th, 7th & 8th). 

Priority Need Areas: 

Based on the trends and patterns in our school data (NYSED) from 2017 to 2018, 70+% of our students are non-
proficient in ELA and 80+% of our students are non-proficient in Math. The data implies that we need to change our 
instructional approach to teach for mastery so that a larger amount of our students achieve proficient or higher on 
the NYSED Tests. Therefore our focus/priority is:  

  Building teacher competence around designing and delivering a curriculum that challenges and engages 

 

students in rigorous learning experiences that increase their procedural and conceptual competence. 
Leveraging Teacher Teams to support the increased understanding of content, i.e., knowing what students 
need to know and show to master specific standards. 

  Collecting data at the close of every lesson to determine percentages of students who mastered the content 

then make next day adjustments to meet the needs of students who are struggling. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, students will increase performance on the 2019 State tests where the percentage of students who earn a 
level 2 or higher will increase from 33% (2018) to 40% (2019) in Math and from 40% (2018) to 48% (2019) in English 
Language Arts by receiving standards based, explicit instruction .

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

1. School leaders, lead teachers and MSQI consultant will analyze 
th results from the Fall DRP administration to create flexible 
reading groups based on students current reading level. Tests 
will occur in September, January and May to analyze students' 
reading levels and progress. This information is shared with the 
entire staff. In addition, teachers will be trained on literacy 
strategies through cycles of targeted professional development 
in order to effectively support students. Students will take 
Cumulative Mastery Assessments (CMA) at end of each unit, 
retrieve feedback to set goals and identify strategies for 
mastering non-mastered content. 

2. Teachers, lead teachers, consultants and administration revise 
and make adjustment to curriculum maps and instructional 
strategies based on DRP collected to allow all students access to 
engaging, accessible materials. Students will engage in goals 
setting at end of each CMA and self-direct pathways to achieving 
content mastery. 

Family curriculum night for parents to understand the purpose of 
assessments. Parents are provided with their child's state score 
in addition to DRP level that aligns with current reading level. 
Parents are provided with resources such as question stems and 
reading websites that will enhance students reading and 
comprehension. Post each DRP administration letters are sent 
home via backpack that indicates the student's current reading 
level and the progress that has been made. Phone calls are also 
conducted to advise parents of their child's progress and areas of 
concern. Data Town hall session will be conducted to inform 
parents on school-wide performance and on ways and means to 
assist they child's academic progress.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Resumes for staff are carefully scrutinized by the principal and the hiring committee. Upon consensus, prospective 
staff members are invited for an interview. For classroom teachers, they are asked to conduct a demonstration 
lesson. For such positions as psychologist and social workers, district supervisors are asked to attend the interview. 
The committee makes recommendation for hiring and the principal makes the final decision on whether to hire a staff 
member or not. Persons are recruited during job fairs, the Open Market or upon recommendation by other 
professionals. During the recruitment process and prior to the commencement of employment, certification 
credentials are verified. Teachers’ assignments are based on their qualification. 

Professional Development is offered to the staff that comes to the school. Staff members are also sent on 
professional development provided by the DOE and the Network Staff. This information is then turn keyed within the 
grades. Administrative staff takes part of workshops given by the Leadership Academy and our BFSC. All information is 
facilitated to all staff members during monthly Faculty and Grade Conferences. Our BFSC provides ongoing 
professional development for staff both on-site and off-site, during the school day and after school. There is intra and 
inter visitation by staff to observe best practices. Staff also attends conferences offered by TIF and Urban Advantage. 
The administrative staff also provides support by modeling for staff members. 

Consultants such as Literacy Math Matters and MSQI partners are invited to the school to provide differentiated 
professional development for staff. The data specialist and the lead teachers conduct best teaching practices for staff. 
All new staff members are mentored by seasoned professionals 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
This is the twelfth consecutive year that our school is implementing the CCLS. Units of studies and curriculum maps 
were developed that are aligned to the CCLS. At the beginning of the school year, staff members receive professional 
development focused on CCLS. Instructional Shifts, mathematical practices and Danielson's Framework for Teaching. 
During common planning each week teachers meet in content areas or with administrators and lead teachers to plan 
rigorous and engaging lessons for students. Teachers set personal goals around pedagogy and based on their needs, 
professional development would be planned for these staff members. As administrators conduct the cycles of

observation and noticed trends for improvement, professional development sessions would be planned at the school 
level, by the network and by the DOE staff.  

Curriculum materials will be reviewed monthly and based on data if need be, adjustments would be made to the 
curriculum. Grades 6-8 teachers studied the item analysis from the last NYS tests and we have identified areas of 
need- standards that the school is doing poorly in both in Math and ELA. Professionals developments session will be 
planned with these critical areas in mind, so that teachers can developed the skills to roll out standard based 
instruction with our students. 

We will be working with ambassadors from TIF to provide relevant professional development for all staff members 
that focus on improving student outcomes.  

Teachers meet in Teacher Teams teams for 45 minutes to look at student work, set goals and develop strategies for 
students. The IEP coordinator and administrative staff also meet with paraprofessionals to discuss how they can 
support the teachers with delivering standards based instruction by providing sentence stems, graphic organizer, 
tiered questioning, strategies for students to chunk text and strategies to review basic math skills. Paraprofessionals 
are also part of the curriculum planning team.  

Administrators attend workshops that are aligned with understanding data, improving pedagogy of teachers, sharing 
best teaching practices, providing actionable, time bound and relevant feedback to teachers. These workshops vary 
within the district, other districts are in partnership with various leadership programs.

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
The teachers are stakeholders in creating the assessments post a whole staff PD in the fall that analyzes the standards 
that are areas of focus based on the prior years state item analysis. The Instructional Leadership Team hosts and 
annual leadership retreat in the Fall to determine next steps to improve student outcomes. The lead teachers turn key 
data and next steps and content area teams decide on how assessments will be created and select standards to focus 
on. All staff members are mandated to maintain data and individual conferences are planned monthly for individual 
staff to analyze students outcomes and progress. At these conferences, current data will be discussed and goals will 
be set for all students. Assessments results will be continuously reviewed by administrators and staff and instruction 
and curriculum adjustment would be made so that the varied needs of all students would be met. Assessments must 
be differentiated to target all students.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Ron Brown Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

M.S. 57 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

- providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level 

e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; 

- providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and  

decision making in support of the education of their children;  

- fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 

monitor their child’s progress; 

- providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

- sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 

in languages that parents can understand; 

- providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 

outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 

other members of the school community 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

- actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

- engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

- ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

- support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 

Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 

technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

- maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 

families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Anthony Lett, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

Interpretation Unit and/or bigword. LACs will review surveys to implement feedback and improve language services. 
LACs will hold a focus group in the spring of interested parents whose preferred language of communication is other 
than English to gather feedback and brainstorm ideas to improve language access for all families. Multilingual staff 
and community members will interpret during the focus group and if necessary interpreter(s) from bigword will be 
hired for lower incidence languages. LACs will use feedback and ideas from the focus group to improve language 
access for the following school year and improve family involvement in the language policies and procedures of the 
school.
