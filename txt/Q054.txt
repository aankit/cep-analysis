Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

At P.S. 54Q – The Hillside School, we believe that all children can succeed and learn best when immersed in a safe, 
risk-free environment where they can interact with each other in partnerships and small groups; developing as critical 
thinkers, and able to apply their learning to real life situations.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Our mission is to set high expectations for success. We take pride in ourselves and celebrate teamwork. We 
demonstrate compassion, commitment and a strong sense of community. We work together to ensure our children 
are strong, independent critical thinkers, ready to meet the challenges of a rigorous curriculum and a global society.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Our school-wide instructional focus for the 2018-19 school year is to develop deeper critical thinkers and strengthen 
their proficiency to express their real world applications of concepts learned. Varied assessments (formative / 
summative) will inform daily instruction and the design of cognitively demanding tasks which allow students to 
communicate their understandings (verbal / written format). Our shared practices will reflect strategic questioning; 
stimulating discussions; and reflective writing; supported by checklists/rubrics. 

We have a Math Professional Learning Community around the Standards of Math Practice. We are partnered with 
Teacher's College for Writing and will be receiving professional development from LCI around critical thinking, We 
also have developed partnerships with LEAP (Learning through an Expanded Arts Program), CUNY Creative Arts Team, 
Cornell University Cooperative Education for Nutrition and Parenting, The Home Depot, Valley National Bank, Key 
Food, St. Mary’s Children Hospital, Queens District Attorney’s office and City Harvest. 

Our current enrollment is 587 students. Approximately one-fourth of our populations are students learning English as 
a New Language. Seven percent of our student populations are receiving services under the Special Education 
Continuum. Our major ethnic groups represented are students of Hispanic and Asian heritage. We continuously strive 
to know, support and move all our students towards meeting their learning targets. Our staff participates in ongoing 
professional development opportunities with specific emphasis on those strategies and techniques that will best 
support our students to improve outcomes.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Particular attention is paid to our ENLs (English as a New Language) and SWDs (Students with Disabilities) to help 
them make greater gains as NYS test results indicate many are performing at a Level 1 and 2 for ELA and Math. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

While we have continued to improve across all elements of the Framework, we have noted marked progress in the 
areas of providing a Supportive Environment; Collaborative Teachers and Strong Family/Community Ties. Teacher 
collaborations were more purposeful within the sessions carved out to support their planning and preparation for 
instruction with PBL Principles and attention to Social / Emotional Learning initiatives being embedded. This attention 
to connecting more closely to individual students made a deeper impact on the improving student participation 
within classrooms and also on our parent participation data. Teacher outreach to families during the Tuesday 
Extended Sessions increased (as evidenced by meeting logs ) and family attendance at school-wide events also 
increased. We plan to continue to strengthen our efforts across the framework , making sure to strategically utilize 
our Thrive representative as well as Sanford Harmony collaboration.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

After analyzing all our ELA data, we noticed the following trends in our students’ outcomes: 

Strengths: 

- analyzing connections and relationships among story elements, ideas and events in a text 

- utilizing text structures to better aid in comprehension 

- evaluating the author’s purpose and point of view to understand content and style 

 

Weaknesses: 

- summarizing the main topics or ideas in a text 

- determining the meaning of key phrases and words in a text concentrating on academic and domain specific 

vocabulary 

- identifying the reasons and evidence that an author gives to support the essential points made in a text 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
In addition to various monthly workshops to strengthen communication and rapport between our families and 
teachers, cohorts of parents are being formed across grade levels. These individuals will be assigned to rotate through 
the classes on the grade and participate in planning and preparation for day to day academic activities, thereby 
building their own repertoire of resources to support their children at home. Parents are interacting with their 
students' work and techniques and strategies being taught. Parents are able to go through activities with their child so 
they are aware of work/activity being done. This collaboration was formulated during a vertical team meeting this 
2018-19 SY. The Principal, Assistant Principal, Parent Coordinator and Grade Leaders will facilitate, supported by 
Paraprofessionals and School Aides. Workshops are given for parents on Close Reading Strategies. The ENL team does 
a workshop for parents around "Questions to ask your child in different situations".

Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.)

currently 
have 2 
students 
in 
Temporary 
Housing 
and expect 
that this 
number 
will 
increase 
with new 
registrants 
through 
the 2017-
18 school 
year. 

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

In preparation for our students within this classification, our Intake Team administers our Intake Questionaire and and 
discreetly and with a discerning eye, identifies need. This is an opportunity to flag any students who might need us to 
coordinate social / emotional supports from the onset. (Consolidated Plan outlines detailed efforts.) We have readied 
backpacks filled with school supplies; school / gym uniforms; and a selection of library books.to provide these children 
with any necessary supplies they may not have access to.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
All staff are qualified, certified and fully licensed as evident in the BEDS survey. Pedagogues appointed to PS 54Q are 
supported with comprehensive Professional Development offerings based on administrative assessment and 
individual self reflections. New teachers are recruited from our cadre of Substitute teachers who participate in our 
professional development sessions / teacher team meetings through the year. Additionally, new hires are given 
increased consideration if they have dual / triple license to support either Special Ed or TESOL or both, given the high 
need of our current student population. Paraprofessionals are also given consideration if they have 2 year degree or 
higher and also if they speak a language other than English that is represented in our school community. This affords 
us greater access to translators for our families. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Professional Development is offered through BFSC; teachers are sent out to attend workshops across content areas. 
Common planning time is built into the schedule to allow for sharing of information/best practices attained at the 
meetings/professional development. School inter-visitations are set up to share best practices. Staff attend Bureau of 
Educational Research (BER) Workshops

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
Based upon identified school needs around personnel and resources, funding decisions are made in conjunction with 
Field Support Center Budget Director and Human Resource Liaisons. Student Reports are generated and data is 
reviewed to ensure that funding guidelines are adhered to in order to meet compliance. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teacher Teams actively engage in ongoing review of student work/data to inform their practice. They conduct regular 
check-ins for understanding to inform their mid-unit adjustments and assessments as they track student progress. 
These efforts are supported by PD plans which offers opportunities for teachers to expand their knowledge and 
practice with curricula; design and implementation of formative assessments; UDL strategies; differentiated 
instruction 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 54Q in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary 
and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. PS 
54Q will continue to support parents and families of Title I students by: 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership

P.S. 54 will be governed by the following statutory definition of parental involvement, and will carry out programs, 
activities and procedures in accordance with this definition: 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

Parental involvement means the participation of parents in regular, two-way, and meaningful communication 
involving student academic learning and other school activities, including ensuring –  

o That parents play an integral role in assisting their child’s learning; 

o That parents are encouraged to be actively involved in their child’s education at school; 

o That parents are full partners in their child’s education and are included, as appropriate, in decision making and on 
advisory committees to assist in the education of their child; the carrying out of other activities, such as those 
described in section 1118 of the ESSA 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

o The school will inform parents and parental organizations of the purpose and existence of the Parental Information 
and Resource Center in the State. 

A parent coordinator will implement and facilitate all parent involvement activities.  

Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, our school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I 
Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to schools to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in our Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend our school and will work to ensure that our school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

P. S. 54 will provide a wide range of opportunities to inform parents about the program design, operation and 
evaluation. Parents and educators will work together to achieve the programs’ objective. The Department of 
Education requires all Title 1 schools to establish a Parent Advisory Council through an election process. P. S. 54 holds 
this election annually in September; the Title 1 representative is also elected annually. The parents must elect the 
members to PAC at a PTA meeting. A majority of parent members on the council must have children who are served 
in a Title 1 program. A teacher may be a member of the council. The council functions in an advisory capacity, in the 
planning, implementing and evaluating of Title1 programs.  

● The Parent Coordinator will schedule these meetings. 

● The PAC or a representative will attend District Advisory Council/District Council of Presidents meeting to: 

-obtain information of their rights/responsibilities under Title 1 guidelines.

Annual Meetings: 

A critical component of all parent activities, especially Curriculum Night, PTA Conferences, registration and 
workshops, is the language component; P. S. 54 provides translation services (written and oral) in the languages of 
our parent population, including some which are not provided by the Dept. of Education translation service providers 
(Punjabi, Urdu, Bengali, Hindi). Open House Curriculum Night is in September. At this time, the Title 1 Parent 
Involvement Policy and School/Title 1 Plan will be distributed. Staff present an overview of their programs. During the 
year, the funded personnel; will conduct workshops related to topics requested by parents. Community resources will 
be brought in to support parents’ needs. The school will provide ongoing communication (monthly calendar, 
newsletter, parent bulletin board at entrance) informing everyone of upcoming school worthy events, (PTA, SLT 
meetings, Open School etc), information, and helpful tips. The Principal will hold quarterly meetings with the PTA 
Executive Board. The Principal’s open door policy has been expanded to include Breakfast Meetings held periodically 
with parents of different grades. These meetings inform, educate and foster good communication and relations. 
Parents will continue to be consulted at PTA meetings and given the opportunity to make recommendations through 
the PAC. 

Our school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

The Title III Program will be open to English Language Learners in grades 2 through 5, and it 
will be held on ten (10) consecutive Saturdays from 9am to 12 noon.  During each Saturday 
session, one supervisor and seven (7) teachers, trained in ESL strategies and sensitized to the 
needs of the ELLs, will present lessons designed to help the students meet the NYC / NYS 
standards  in English as a Second Language and English Language Arts. Lessons will be aligned 
to the CCLS; the CIEs and our 2016-17 Instructional Focus as stipulated in our annual school 
goals and noted within our CEP.   The program is anticipated to begin on January 13, 2018 and 
end on April 28, 2017. 
There will be four classes of (15) students each, organized according to English language 
proficiency as indicated by the NYSESLAT and NYSITEL exams.  Instruction will be provided 
by a licensed ENL teacher and a common branch teacher in an integrated team teaching model 
for each class.  Each team of educators will implement ESL strategies and scaffold instruction in 
order to facilitate and enhance students' competence in English in accordance with the 
standards.  Instruction will focus on language development with an emphasis on narrative and 
informational text / writing. The additional content area teacher will focus technology and 
provide the children with opportunities to practice research and writing skills using interactive 
white board; laptops and ipads. (The Technology Teacher will also facilitate support to parents 
during the parent involvement sessions being provided.) 
Students’ strengths and weaknesses will be informed by current student data (Fountas & Pinell; 
MOSL; Unit Assessments / Benchmark Tasks;) and addressed by differentiating instruction and 
the appropriately tiered intervention strategies will be implemented accordingly. Teachers will 
provide multiple entry points for student engagement and participation in the content and 
concepts presented using the UDL strategies we have been implementing school-wide. (PD has 
been ongoing in these areas and supported by multiple resources.) 
During each session, students will be scheduled for three periods of interdisciplinary literacy 
instruction in writing/speaking, reading/listening, and literacy through technology.  Activities in 
listening, speaking, reading and writing will be aligned with the units of study within the 
Balanced Literacy program. 
These activities will include but are not limited to maintaining writers’ notebooks, author studies; 
read-alouds; literature circles; and shared / paired reading; with a strong focus on immersing 
students in non-fiction literature to further strengthen language acquisition and build academic 
vocabulary.  Technology will be used to support non-fiction applications in an effort to 
familiarize students with word processing and to teach them how to use the internet for 
research.  Small groups will further support students receiving differentiated and individualized

instruction, and will also enable teachers to confer frequently to tailor instruction to the varied 
learning styles of students in their group.  Congruence between Title III teachers and the 
students’ regular classroom teachers will help guide the direction of instruction and reinforce 
areas that have been identified as requiring further strengthening. 
Assessment will be ongoing throughout the program, and will be evidenced by work samples in 
students’ portfolios; performance tasks; and teacher generated assessments, as well as conference 
notes.  Materials utilized are supplemental and distinct from those used for daily instruction. 
These will include but are not limited to the Leveled National Geographic Non-Fiction Series; 
MONDO Safari selections; Now I Get It series; Scholastic Guided Reading Quick Reads; as well 
as the Leap Track Reading System and Voyager.  These contain high interest non-fiction content 
which motivates readers of varied abilities by providing for interactive, multi-sensory 
instruction; critical word-work knowledge; and the development of reading comprehension.

Begin description here:            
  
For the duration of the program, 1 hour sessions of professional development will be provided 
for the teachers on each day of the program. The professional development program will be 
facilitated by the ENL teachers and supervisor. It will be designed to inform the instructional 
staff on the best practices within ENLinstruction to be employed in assisting the targeted 
students in increasing their level of achievement in listening, speaking, reading, and writing 
activities across the content areas.  This training will take place for one (1) hour from 8:00AM to 
9:00AM on each of the Saturdays, immediately preceding the beginning of the 9:00AM to 12:00 
PM program being offered to the students. (Funding will be provided by the school 5% Set Aside 
Title I TL funding.) Agendas and attendance sheets will be maintained along with program 
records by the Supervisor in Charge (AP or Principal.) 
Additionally, teachers will be supported with integrating technology in their instruction through 
the use of Smart Boards / Projectors,  thereby reinforcing English Language Learning for this 
targeted ENL population. Teachers will have access to current student data (MOSL; Fountas & 
Pinell Benchmarks; Unit Assessments; etc) in order to better inform instructional strategies being 
implemented for these students. Specialized techniques for ENL instruction will include 
experiential learning as well as hands-on, visually stimulating lessons.  Research has shown that 
our students gain substantial transference of skills from the exposure to hands-on applications. 
All instruction will be aligned with CCLS; the CIEs and our Instructional Focus as set forth in 
our annual school goals, as evidenced in our CEP for the 2017-18 SY. 
Teachers have an overview of the NYS ESL Standards; copies of “Classroom Teacher’s ESL 
Survival Kit #1 and #2”. All teachers already posess a copy of the "ESL Strategies" and "Critical 
Thinking Strategies" flip book by Mentoring Minds to support their lesson planning and 
implementation of instruction. These tools provide useful questioning stems and prompts aligned 
to improving "Questioning and Discussion" practice for our children. In addition, our teachers 
will also utilize the following professional resources: "Classroom Instruction That Works With 
Englsh Language Learners" (2nd Edition); "Content-Area Conversations"; "Total Participation 
Techniques"; "50 Strategies For Teaching English Language Learners"; as well as "The

Begin description here:            
  
In our efforts to make the parents of our ENL students feel increasingly more comfortable within 
our school environment and to involve them in the academic lives of their children, they will be 
invited to participate in the ten sessions of English Language Instruction Through 
Technology.  These sessions, which will have a strong technology focus, will be held 
concurrently with the instructional program for the children.  The sessions will also be held 
from  9am to 12 noon each Saturday. Parents will be immersed in the instructional strategies 
implemented in ESL to become better informed in ways to further support and reinforce their 
child’s education at home.  
Parents will receive technology training utilizing our computer lab and will engage in similar 
instructional activities as their children by cycling through the sessions in the same manner as the 
children.  Instructional support for parents will be provided through Title III ELL Academy at no 
additional cost and will be further supported by the regularly scheduled workshops offered 
during the school year to parents / families within our school community. Parents will be 
provided with a schedule of workshops, each with varied focus at the beginning of the Saturday 
ELL Academy and this will also be communicated via our Monthly School Calendar and Parent 
Newsletters. The Parent Coordinator will be in attendance to ensure additional support and to 
coordinate translations services as needed.  (Cost of PC is will be covered by school budget.)

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 Assessment tools used at PS 54 to assess early literacy skills of ELLs are Fountas & Pinnell, Fountas & Pinnell in Spanish, 
Fundations, Leveled Literacy Intervention, and Great Leaps - TCRWP as well as formative assessments by classroom teachers. 
The data identifies areas of deficiencies found in phonemic awareness, sight words, fluency and decoding.  We also analyze the 
BOY and EOY MoSL assessments to identify trends and provide strategic and targeted supports to bridge those gaps identified.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

ENL students are assessed three times a year with Fountas & Pinnell; beginning, middle and end of year.  We have five 
RTI Cycles throughout the year as well.  Each RTI Cycle lasts approximately 6 weeks.  During this time, teachers provide 
targeted instruction based on data from classroom observations of students, tests, check-ins and exit slips.  Another structure 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

in place to support our ENL students is the incorporation of Great Leaps.  Great Leaps is administered to students who 
demonstrate difficulties in phonemic awareness, decoding and fluency.  An Admin/Team Teaching period is built in four times 
a week for grades 3-5 to further provide targeted and purposeful small group instruction.  In K-2, Fundations is used to provide 
systematic and explicit instruction in foundational skills for reading and spelling, phonics-word study, vocabulary and 
handwriting. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Success is measured in terms of the number of students who are able to exit the program via NYSESLAT, as well as showing 
movement from a lower level of proficiency to a higher one in each domain of language learning. ELA and Math scores of Level 
2 and above are further evidence of success.  MOSL is administered at the beginning and end of year and is used as a measure 
of growth as well as Benchmark Periodic Assessments in ELA and mathematics given in the fall and spring in grades 3-5.  Any 
small increments of achievement in academic as well as social areas for English as a New Language Learners are important and 
are celebrated..      
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The following structures are in place to address interventions once data has been gathered: RTI; Great Leaps; targeted 
classroom centers; differentiated instruction; AIS afterschool, Title III Saturday Academy; focused professional development 
around data gathered from summative data as well as during Inquiry cycles as well as professional book club meetings.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
At PS 54, there is a strong focus on promoting language and literacy development founded on a rigorous and effective 
instructional core (Tier 1). Tier I instruction builds on and expands students' existing oral language competencies to support 
their literacy learning and content knowledge.   In grades K-2, instruction is focused on developing oral language and early 
literacy skills through the use of language experience;questioning and discussion techniques; interactive read alouds; story 
telling using wordless books; and vocabulary instruction. In grades 3-5, instruction is focused on developing language and 
literacy skills by front loading vocabulary; sentence structure and concepts; open ended questions that engage students in 
discussions and dialogue about a variety of topics; close reading; language frames for speaking and writing; sentence 
transformations through guided dialogue; and jointly constructed extended writing.    Our students have an opportunity to 
learn about, study and discuss the language of various texts.  Tier II RTI  instruction occurs in smaller groups of 5-8 students 
and focuses primarily on providing increased opportunities to practice and learn skills taught.  Tier II RTI Students in grade K, 1 
and 2 are receiving Double Dose Fundations, grade 3 students are engaged in Double Dose Fundations, Dibbles and LLI; grade 
4 and 5 students receive LLI as well.  Tier III Students receive SPIRE and Dibbles. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The following structures are in place to disseminate data findings to make adjustments to programs: Weekly common planning 
time among grade teams (including ENL providers), vertical planning meetings during Monday extended sessions, articulation 
between classroom teachers, ENL providers and Related Service Providers on Tuesday afternoons, Grade Leader/ENL common 
planning time, Special Education cohort and weekly Instructional Cabinet.      
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The following structures are in place to disseminate data findings to make adjustments to programs: Data Dives; 
reorganization meetings; ENL provider input; open communication between classroom teachers, administration, and ENL 
service providers.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The language program offered at PS 54Q is Free Standing ENL that follows a Stand Alone/Integrated model.  Both the 
Stand Alone and Integrated models require collaboration between the classroom teacher and ENL provider.  Both 
work in tandem to ensure that the appropriate mandates from CR Part 154 are adhered to.  In our Stand Alone ENL 
program, our entering students receive 180 minutes of study in ENL per week and our Emerging students receive 90 
minutes of study in ENL per week.  In our Integrated ENL program, our Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, and 
Expanding students receive 180 minutes of study per week.  Our commanding students receive 90 minutes of 
Integrated ENL instruction per week.  Every classroom at PS 54 has incorporated a Language Objective into 
practice.  Students are grouped heterogeneously throughout each grade K - 5.     

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

According to CR Part 154, Transitioning and Expanding students in Grades K-5 are serviced in a Stand Alone/Integrated model. 
They receive 4 periods of Integrated ENL per week for a total of 180 minutes. 
K-5 Students at the Entering and Emerging levels are serviced through Stand Alone instruction for four periods a week for a 
total of 180 minutes in addition to Integrated ENL for four periods equaling 180 minutes for a total of 360 minutes of service.   
These language proficiency levels and services are dictated by the NYSITELL/NYSESLAT scores.      
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
    The ENL teacher pushes in during literacy/writing blocks to deliver language instruction in a co-teaching model.  ENL 
teachers, classroom teachers and service providers have common preparation time to plan, organize, and coordinate 
instruction, as well as work on long and short term goals for the students.  In addition, this time is utilized to collect and 
analyze data derived from various assessments in addition to daily classroom tasks (ELA, periodic assessments, NYSESLAT, 
performance series, Fountas & Pinnell), which are then used to drive and differentiate instruction.  Technology is integrated 
into daily instruction in the classroom to build background knowledge, conduct research, write reports and engage in 
academic applications during centers in the content areas. Through the use of technology ELLs have been noted to make gains 
in their acquisition of academic language, and demonstrate greater ability to work independently. All staff members at P.S. 54 
have high expectations for their students, fully realizing that ELLs have to meet the dual challenge of acquiring a new language 
(including academic language) as well as learning content.  In order to  facilitate content learning and ensure academic rigor, 
P.S. 54 implements best teaching practices and learning strategies that are aligned with current Common Core Learning 
Standards, and core curriculum in literacy and content areas.  Each ENL lesson is designed with both content and language 
objectives in mind.  Differentiated instruction and ENL methodology are essential in order to meet the educational needs 
within each ELL subgroup.  Instruction of ELLs is consistent with the Balanced Literacy program that is implemented 
throughout the school, following the workshop model. Students work in flexible groups. Within these groups new learners 
receive comprehensible input from teachers and peers, and have more opportunity for oral practice and repetition of content 
information as peers help ELLs negotiate meaning.  Instruction of English language functions and grammar structures 
take place within the context of a lesson.  Scaffolding helps to support students’ understanding of academic content.  ENL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

teachers use and encourage classroom teachers to utilize a wide variety of print and visual resources to support the 
development of academic language.  Language in the classroom is modeled so that ELLs receive comprehensible input in a 
manner consistent with their ability to participate, but which does not reduce the quality of the language input from the 
teacher.  Instruction for newcomers who are new arrivals, as well as students who have been in the U.S. longer, but less than 
three years, encompasses a variety of approaches which incorporate visuals and gestural cues, realia, repetition, paraphrasing 
and TPR (Total Physical Response).  The use of big books and picture books for beginners are effective tools for making 
vocabulary comprehensible and encouraging oral language.  Graphic organizers are used to help enhance students 
comprehension of content, increase higher thinking skills, and facilitate the writing process.   In addition, newcomers are often 
paired with other students who share the same language background to help the new arrivals adjust to their new school 
environment.  Teachers model the appropriate language and are cognizant that sometimes there might be a “silent period”.   
It is our goal at P. S. 54 to make our ELLS full participants in the daily instructional programs and to engage them in 
accountable talk with specific focus on the transitional ELLs and their need to develop academic language.  One way to achieve 
this goal is through the use of literature that reflects the students’ cultural background.   This in turn enables the learners to 
activate their prior knowledge as a way of connecting to the lesson. As comfort level and proficiency in English develop, 
content area instruction becomes an integral part of the lesson.  Content is taught by both classroom and ENL teachers.  The 
ENL teacher frontloads the lesson, previews vocabulary and facilitates the comprehension of difficult linguistic 
structures/passages in the text. Articulation between ENL and classroom teachers occurs on a weekly basis to coordinate 
content area instruction and to plan how best to scaffold lessons before the content is introduced to the students.   Scaffolding 
is provided when needed to promote deeper understanding and retention of the lesson.  Classroom teachers are able to utilize 
ENL strategies in order to make content more comprehensible to their ELLs.  Through the use of visual cues, speaking in a clear 
voice at a normal rate of speech, using repetitions, paraphrasing key points, and defining essential vocabulary within a context, 
learning targets are made salient to students.  Working with peers in small, flexible groups during daily instruction is an 
effective strategy to ensure that ELLs are actively engaged in the learning process. When content, goals and strategies are 
coordinated; the opportunity for academic language to develop is greatly increased.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

    Students whose home language is Spanish are evaluated with the Spanish LAB.   In order to gain some understanding of their 
academic background, Spanish Fountas & Pinnell is used to evaluate independent and instructional reading 
levels. Additionally, translators and translated materials are utilized whenever possible with the exception of English reading 
comprehension tests.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 ENL teachers help their students prepare for assessment and standardized tests, teaching, for example, not only content but 
the academic language embedded in the questions.  Results of these assessments are shared by classroom and ENL teachers in 
order to tailor instruction to the needs of the students in a consistent manner. 
     a. Our SIFE students are provided basic instruction in letter recognition, phonemic awareness and phonics. Throughout the 
school day translation and modeling are provided by teachers and peers in order to facilitate comprehension. Picture books 
and big books with repetitive text are utilized taking into consideration the student's age and interest. Content area is 
presented through the use of visual aides such as photographs, posters, maps and graphs.  Differentiated instruction and UDL 
strategies are utilized throughout the day to strengthen proficiency in key foundational skills. 
      b. With our Newcomer ELLs, teachers utilize visuals and gestural cues, realia, simple sentence frames, repetition, 
paraphrasing and TPR during instruction.  Big books and picture books are used to develop vocabulary and facilitate oral 
language development.  Newcomer ELLs are paired with other students who share the same home language to help them 
adjust to their new school environment as well as facilitate academic conversations within the classroom.  
      c. Developing ELLs and d. Long-Term ELLs have instruction tailored to their needs. When instruction is differentiated to 
address the specific needs of this particular group, more targeted academic instruction is implemented. Materials are 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

examined and adapted to meet the students' level of achievement. Visuals, text and vocabulary previewing, discussions, 
clarifications and explanations are examples of materials and methods that are employed. Content area instruction is a 
priority. ENL and non-ENL teachers use appropriate level fiction and non-fiction books. Dictionary work, math, social studies 
and science textbooks are adapted for the ELLs. Emphasis is placed on Tier II words that emphasize higher level vocabulary and 
concept development.  Instruction/Material are differentiated and UDL strategies are incorporated in the course of 
instruction.  
Students who have achieved proficiency in the English language continue to be monitored by ENL and classroom teachers.  The 
students' progress is measured by results from Periodic Assessments and assessments of overall performance in the 
classroom.  Technology is utilized to develop Tier 2 and 3 vocabulary as well as complex language structures, build background 
knowledge and engage students in instruction.  
       e. We provide Former ELLs with additional support for two years after they achieve proficiency on the NYSESLAT. During 
close reading, we support the students in developing better understanding of more challenging texts, advanced vocabulary, 
more complex grammatical structures while enhancing higher order skills.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Students with Disabilities are serviced according to the mandates of their IEPs.  In order to facilitate access to academic 
content, ELLs and SWDs have access to listening centers, interactive SMART boards are used in the classroom, computer 
assisted instruction is provided whenever possible.  Specifically, ENL providers incorporate instructional strategies such as 
chunking the text, adjusting questions, flexible grouping, jigsaw, memory cards, reading buddies, small group instruction, total 
physical response (TPR), tiered assignments, varied texts, task cards, visual aids and word sorts.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 At PS 54Q SWDs are flexibly scheduled into the Least Restrictive Environment throughout the day.  For example, students are 
flexibly scheduled during physical education; technology; science; and lunch periods. Flexible schedules with an academic lens 
is provided for placement into a grade level class when appropriate for literacy and math instruction. Students' progress and 
needs are addressed by general education, special education, ENL providers as well as related service providers during monthly 
Special Education Cohort meetings as well as during grade common preps.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our targeted intervention program for ELLs scoring Level 1 and 2 in ELA consists of Wilson, Great Leaps, Fundations, Leveled 
Literacy Intervention (LLI), Voyager Ticket to Read, Balanced Literacy utilizing Teacher's College Reading components, Ready 
Gen, and Schoolwide Inc. Writing Program.   We use stand-alone / integrated models with small group instruction, 1:1 tutoring, 
peer tutoring, during the day and in Saturday ENL Academy.  Go Math lessons are differentiated and taught utilizing 
manipulatives.  Games are used at the end of week to reinforce concepts.  Students create their own materials using 
mathematical units for projects.     
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

PS 54Q will continue to use the Ready Gen and Go Math Core Curriculum. Teachers have made adjustments to the curriculum 
maps in all content areas to insure better alignment with CCLS with an emphasis on ENL methodologies.  These programs are 
Common Core aligned, have built in check-ins and are differentiated to address the needs of the ELL population.   In addition, 
National Geographic Ladders will be utilized along with MyOn Reading, Mathletics and Passport Voyager.  School staff have 
also been engaged in a variety of Professional Learning Communities to enrich the school experience.  Teachers have been 
engaged in LCI - Quality Curriculum, Math Problem Solving and Close Reading Literacy PLCs.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 Strategic scheduling of our supplemental programs, ensure that ELLs have equal access to all school programs including after 
school AIS Academy; Saturday ELL Academy.  All students, including our ELLs have access to rigorous curriculum and CCSS 
aligned instruction.  Based on needs, students were also  invited to a three-week ELL Summer School session. Programs are 
offered on varying days / schedules to afford flexibility for selection / participation by our ENL Students.     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our ELLs have access to technology in the classroom and computer lab. SMART boards are available in all classrooms, as well 
as document readers, ipads, listening centers, maps, globes, manipulatives, scientific tools, DBQs, direct translation 
dictionaries, thesaurus and graphic organizers/anchor charts that support lesson content.   In addition, learning centers are an 
established feature within each classroom to support our new English Learners and their peers who might need the additional 
scaffolds.  Materials from MONDO are used to develop vocabulary and oral language.  These materials are available for all ENL 
subgroups.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

We have resources available in students' home languages.  In addition, independent reading books are available in Bengali, 
Punjabi, Urdu, Arabic, and Spanish.  ENL instruction is delivered primarily in English with the use of Native Language to clarify 
concepts.      
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

PS 54Q provides a wealth of materials and resources designed to support the age and grade level of our ELLs. Our school 
implements practices and learning strategies that are aligned with mandated Common Core Learning Standards. The 
instruction of ELLs is aligned to the Balanced Literacy program that is implemented throughout the school following the 
Workshop model. Specific instructional materials are used to help ELLs meet those standards. Students are grouped according 
to levels obtained from NYSESLAT. They participate in small group instruction that is task oriented. Technology is used to assist 
in their acquisition of the English language. Classrooms display students' work at all levels of language learning. Teachers 
scaffold academic language to assist the ELLs, and offer opportunities for oral practice and numerous repetitions of content 
information to help ELLs negotiate meaning. All staff members model the standard use of English. All classrooms have leveled 
libraries that students have access to for both instruction and enjoyment of reading.  Ongoing assessment strategies are used 
to ascertain the level of students' progress throughout the year. Lessons are designed to meet the standards while allowing for 
the different levels and needs of the students. Learning portfolios are used and reviewed throughout the year by the students 
and teachers.  In addition students have access to Common Core aligned mentor texts and materials to support their varied 
skill levels.  Teachers are supported in refining their practice to better support our ELLs through the extensive professional 
development sessions offered by the Network / BFSC; outside partnerships; and in-house PLCs in math and ENL.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We are not co-located.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Following the process of registration newly enrolled ELLs are given a tour of the school to familiarize themselves with the lay 
out of the building and the staff.  We do provide newly enrolled families with a translator to alleviate any anxiety for both 
students and families as well as answer any questions/provide supports to ease the transition into our school community.  At 
P.S. 54Q we have a rich multiculturally diverse population. As new students are enrolled we make it our priority to make the 
new entrants feel welcome and become active members of our school community by partnering them with other children of 
similar language / geo-political roots. With this goal in mind individual and group meetings are held. Parents are invited to visit 
our school and become familiar with the programs offered. Translated informational literature, beginning level books and 
survival skill information is made available. An initial meeting is held with parents to give them an overview of instructional 
programs / services offered ; a school events calendar / school schedules during meeting with the Parent Coordinator / 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

Guidance Counselor / Social Worker; along with available community resources ; and a schedule of parent meetings and 
workshops to be held through the year. Some activities made available to newly enrolled ELLs include: PTC, Meet The Teacher 
Night, Family Math Night, Family Literacy Night and Movie Night.  During the summer months we offered a program for newly 
enrolled ENL students that combined academic skills with day to day tasks.  This summer immersion program also provided an 
opportunity for students to participate in various neighborhood trips to familiarize students with the community around them 
(i.e. post office, supermarket train station).

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
    
In order to support all teachers of ELLs and paraprofessionals that work with these students, various professional development 
opportunities are provided by the school.  These professional development opportunities are offered to both pedagogical and 
non-pedagogical staff during our Monday extended day sessions, as well as our PS 54Q ENL PLC.  pedagogues participate in 
book clubs that examine a variety of topics, including close reading, math centers, literacy, STEM, text dependant questions 
and scaffolding language/learning.  Paraprofessionals have been engaged in a scholarly article share out in which various ENL 
best practices are shared.   District level professional development is also offered by the Queens South Field Support Center. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
   
   Throughout the school year, ENL, classroom and cluster teachers have the opportunity to attend workshops that address a 
myriad of topics. As teachers attend workshops outside of PS 54, they share pertinent information with all staff. More recently 
discussed topics include aligning Common Core Standards to literacy and math, Writing Workshops through the Office of OELL, 
Exemplary Practices for ENLs through BETAC, and Differentiating Instruction.  Our QSFSC has also provided instructional 
workshops in ENL, Math, Special Education, Fundations,  and English Language Learners Compliance Workshops.  Our 
Professional Learning Communities will continue to meet, utilizing weekly Extended Sessions (Mon/Tues). Faculty Conferences 
that are now built in to these Extended Sessions, are also utilized as a forum for providing additional support for all staff to 
refine their pedagogical practice. The PD Calendar maps out the various topics informed by needs assessments; teacher 
feedback and ADVANCE observations; and instructional rounds. PD topics include conversations around the schools 
Instructional Focus which has built in a lens to strengthen student to student discussions; PS 54's CEP school goals for 2018-
2019; The Differentiated Classroom; Classroom Instruction that Works for ELLs; Building Academic Vocabulary; and Checking 
For Understanding are also priority areas we will be addressing.  Ongoing PD will continue to include opportunities for teachers 
to strengthen their analysis of student data and to use it strategically set goals and inform their teacher moves to further 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

impact their students'  skills which are embedded within our school's goals.  We will continue to revisit past topics such as : 
Close Reading, Guided Instruction; Gradual Release of Responsibility Instructional Framework; and raising the academic rigor 
of instructional expectations in math/ literacy; scaffolding student thinking; targeting instruction for all students especially our 
ELLs and SWDs; unpacking embedded language in content areas; frontloading vocabulary; scaffolding concepts; and TPR. 
     All staff are informed of progress achieved on NYSITELL and NYSESLAT as students transition from one level to 
another.  Additional data gathered from examining tends in MOSL and Periodic Assessments are carefully analyzed and 
discussed during common preps and Monday/ Tuesday extended sessions.  Strategies are then recommended.  When needed, 
ENL teachers model lessons in the classroom with emphasis on frontloading vocabulary before beginning a unit of study, 
unpacking embedded language in content areas and providing background information on units of study.  For those students 
transitioning to middle school, content area vocabulary and concept development are stressed and reinforced throughout the 
year utilizing scaffolding and ENL methodologies.  
     Professional development is offered to classroom and cluster teachers as well as related service professionals in the form of 
workshops given by the ENL instructors. Workshops have included NYSESLAT training and scoring, SIFE, 50 ELL strategies, 
Ready Gen, Go Math, Danielson Framework, Close Reading and Questioning/Discussion techniques, Language Progressions, 
and Guided Reading.  Implementation of ENL methodology is periodically revisited. A variety of approaches designed to 
facilitate comprehension of the English language are presented to the classroom teachers. They are encouraged to incorporate 
visuals and gestural cues in their lessons, use realia, graphic organizers, differentiated instruction, preview text and vocabulary 
prior to presenting their lessons. All these strategies are designed to scaffold the lessons in order to facilitate learning. 
Workshops outside of the school are offered to the staff as well including Wilson, BER Workshops (varied content and grade 
specific offerings), Singapore Math, and Move to Improve. ENL and classroom teachers share common preparation time to 
plan, organize and coordinate instruction, materials and strategies, work on long and short term goals, and collect and analyze 
data relating to each student.  
     In order to provide additional support in ENL strategies, teachers are selected to participate in a series of 
workshops. QSFSC specialists take part in PD at the school. These workshops were designed to improve various techniques in 
the classroom specifically for ELLs, among other student population groups. This information is then shared with the rest of the 
staff.  All professional development agendas; attendance logs and workshop materials are housed in a binder in the assistant 
principals' office.     
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Teachers and school administrators utilize 40 minutes of parent engagement time every Tuesday afternoon to continuously 
communicate with parents. Progress reports are sent home twice each academic year (winter & spring) in addition to the 
report cards sent three times per year (marking period 1, 2, 3 and Final) to keep parents informed of their child's 
progress.  Meetings provide opportunities for parents and students to meet with Classroom Teacher, ENL teacher, Related 
Service Providers (where applicable )and translators as needed. Specifically, ENL providers meet with families to discuss the 
students' language acquisition and the new language arts progressions to highlight the areas of mastery in the various English 
proficiency levels.  In addition, ENL providers meet with parents one additional time per year, as outlined in CR 154. Parents 
sign in on a school conference sign-in sheet at the start of a meeting, along with all parties in attendance. Sign in sheets are 
maintained by classroom teachers and shared with school administrative team upon request.  

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
We offer multiple opportunities for families to engage with the school community at PS 54Q.  We have our school events listed 
and translated into various languages, including our School Messenger program which allows families to receive a phone 
call/text message to remind them of important school events/happenings.  We also use Class Dojo in our classrooms which 
allow for real-time updates to and from families to the teacher.  Upon entering the building, we have a large poster by school 
safety outside the Main Office outlining the various languages spoken by school staff.  We also have staff assist in translations 
for letters, memos, reminders, tear-offs, etc to help ensure that families are kept informed.  During our Saturday ELL Academy, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

we offer workshops for families to attend which cover a range of topics from science fair preparation, NYS Assessments, and 
NYSESLAT Information.  We also involve our families by encouraging participation in our Family Literacy Night, Family Math 
Night, Nutrition Workshop series, Breakfast with Administration, Career Day, Yoga/Movement Workshop series, Wounded 
Warrier Fund walkathon, Breast Cancer walkathon,  grade assemblies (attendance), field trips, and STEM workshop series, 
Critical Thinking workshop series.  We also have our translators available during each Parent Conference.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Anita Prashad, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In order to assess the language preference of the parent community for both oral and written communication, we 
utilize the following methodologies: Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS); Citywide/District Parents’ 
Preferred Language Report (RCPL); School Level Adult Preferred Language Report (RAPL); initial interviews/intake 
with parents; and STUDENT EMERGENCY CONTACT cards, which is updated every year to reflect appropriate 
language.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Information regarding preferred language is indicated by the parent on page 2 of the Home Language Identification 
Survey (HLIS) in the areas of oral communication and written correspondence. This information is also listed on the 
students’ Blue Emergency Cards. This information is then entered into ATS by our Pupil Accounting Secretary. In 
addition, a multilingual Welcome Poster is posted by the primary entrance and language identification cards are 
available at the safety officer’s desk as well as the main office. Translated copies of Parents’ Bill of Rights and 
Responsibilities are prominently posted in the school’s main office and are easily accessible to all parents.

language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

At various school events, parents will be given the opportunity to weigh in on the services that are available to them. 
During parent workshops, parents will fill out a brief reflection sheet which will include an area for suggestions. Parent 
surveys will also be distributed during orientation sessions and Parent Teacher Conferences. Personnel will be 
available to provide assistance, as needed.
