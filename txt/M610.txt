Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The Young Women’s Leadership School was established to nurture the intellectual curiosity and creativity of young 
women and to address their developmental needs. We strive to support the 'whole girl' in order to maximize 
academic achievement, social emotional well-being, and post-secondary success. We cultivate dynamic, participatory 
learning, enabling students to experience great success at many levels, especially in the fields of math, science, and 
technology. Students are encouraged to achieve their personal best in and out of the classroom. TYWLS works with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

families to instill in students a sense of community, responsibility, and ethical principles of behavior – characteristics 
that will help them become leaders of their generation.  

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Young Women’s Leadership School of East Harlem (TYWLS) opened in 1996 as the first school in a national 
network of excellent all-girls college prep schools. Our school is guided by teachers and staff dedicated to creating a 
supportive and academically challenging environment, investing in each girl's potential to achieve high standards in 
every area including math, science, and technology. We have a very supportive school culture that includes daily 
advisory, focused on various topics that affect teenagers including building healthy relationships, conflict resolution, 
college awareness, social awareness, strong academic habits, and personal health, in addition to academic advising. 
Our advisors also lead our effort to be in regular contact with students’ families and involve them in the academic 
progress of their daughters. We offer a robust after-school academic tutoring program with tutoring in all major 
subjects. In the middle school, this tutoring is embedded in a broader after-school enrichment program run in 
partnership with Girls Inc. At TYWLS, our students have opportunities for challenging work both in the classroom and 
through partnerships with many outside organizations. For example, through a partnership with Columbia University 
and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, our high school students have the opportunity to do scientific fieldwork 
alongside professional researchers and grad students and participate in seminars taught by Columbia faculty. The 
Young Women’s Leadership Network supports TYWLS with a wide range of programs to help prepare our students for 
leadership in their communities, including a variety of mentor programs, an annual Career Day event, a summer 
enrichment program, and a variety of health and STEM related programs. TYWLS is also supported by the College 
Bound Initiative (CBI), which promotes college access and financial aid options for every student. We have a full-time 
CBI college counselor on staff who guides students and parents through the process of visiting and choosing colleges, 
applying to college, and applying for financial aid. Since its inception, TYWLS has been successful, with graduation and 
college acceptance rates between 95-100% each year. 

 

TYWLS is a Title I school, predominantly serving students from East Harlem and the Bronx. 72% of our students qualify 
for free lunch. The majority of our students enter the school with scores below proficiency on state assessments. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Over 20% of our students have IEPs. 4% of our students are English Language Learners, and many of our students are 
former English Language Learners.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Over the past year, our school has made progress in a number of the elements of the Framework for Great Schools.  

Within the element of Rigorous Instruction we met our goal of offering all of our 8th graders accelerated Algebra 
Instruction. We came extremely close to meeting our goals for these students on the Common Core Algebra Regents 
exam. 69% of our 8th grade passed the exam (our goal was 70%) and 48% passed with a college-ready score of above 
a 70 (our goal was 50%). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Within the element of Strong Family-Community ties, we improved our communication with parents through a more 
extensive use of translation and translation services. Parent e-mails were sent in Spanish and English, attendance 
information was communicated to parents in their home language via the Kinvo app, and we increased our use of the 
phone and in-person interpretation services to communicate via phone with parents who prefer a language other 
than English or Spanish. 

And within the element of Collaborative Teachers, our School-Wide Instructional Team continued to research, pilot, 
and disseminate teaching strategies for student engagement, including the development of an online resource. 

This year, a key area of focus will be to strengthen element 5B, Supportive Environment, with the launching of new 
inter-grade 'House' structure as part of our Advisory program, with the goals of increasing student imprint on the 
community, through student led initiatives in community service, health and wellness, school pride, and student 
voice. 

Additionally, as we continue to our mission to prepare our students for college coursework in STEM, we will be 
expanding our AP offerings to include AP Calculus and engage in a process to improve student achievement in 
rigorous STEM courses including Algebra II and Chemistry.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
One of the pillars of TYWLS, is to provide students with quality instruction in advanced math and science courses to 
prepare them for pursuing college and career paths in STEM. 80% of the graduating class of 2016-17 achieved the 
college ready benchmark in math, and 90% of the graduating class of 2017-18 did the same. In 2016-17, 33% of the 
graduating class had passed the Algebra II regents exam, and in 2017-18 43% of the graduating class passed the 
Algebra II regents exam. As our college ready rates in math and our Algebra II regents exam scores increase, we want 
to ensure that students have ample opportunity for advanced coursework in math beyond Algebra II. Currently we 
offer one AP math course, Statistics. In 2017-18, 27 students took the AP Stats class, with (scores haven't been 
released yet) achieving a 2 or greater and (scores haven't been released yet) achieving a 3 or greater on the AP 
Statistics exam. In 2018-19, our priority is to increase the number of students enrolled in AP Math classes and 
achieving scores of a 2 or greater, in part by offering AP Calculus in addition to AP Statistics. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, the number of students receiving a 2 or more on the AP College Board math exams will increase by 10% 
as measured by the 2018-2019 score reports.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
The advisory program is central to our school's mission and focus. Each student is connected with at least one adult 
who serves as a first point of contact for academic or personal issues. Teachers meet regularly in grade teams to 
discuss student progress, make referrals to the guidance counselor and reach out to parents. We have been rated well 
developed in the Principal Performance Review and our rating in Trust on the Student Survey is consistently over 4.  

 

In spring 2018, teachers proposed introducing a House system to increase student voice and ownership in the school 
community. They noted that in the Student Learning Survey, approximately 20% of students say that there is a not 
wide variety of programs to keep them interested in school." Teachers researched schools that use Houses to help 
students gain a sense of belonging. Jung Sook Lee wrote about this type of student engagement in the article The 
Relationship between Student Engagement and Academic Performance: Is It a Myth or Reality?. "Multilevel analysis 
showed that...emotional engagement (defined as sense of belonging) significantly predicted reading performance."  

 

Based on data from the supportive environment section of the Learning Environment Survey, over the last two years 
we have included more opportunities for HS students to mentor MS students. In spring 2018, teachers proposed that 
for school year 2018 - 2019 including a House system along with Advisory. Each student would be involved in a multi 
grade House group. The House program will embed this mentorship in the weekly House and committee meetings. 
Juniors and seniors will serve as house captains and lead committees in five core areas: TYWLS Pride, Sisterhood, 
Student Voice, Health/Wellness, and Community Service.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

By June 2019, we will promote and increase student voice as each House organizes a school wide initiative/project 
in one of five core areas (TYWLS Pride, Sisterhood, Student Voice, Health/Wellness, and Community Service) as 
measured by a 4% increase in the supportive environment section score of the NYC School Survey.

and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our teachers work hard to continuously improve their practice. Over the last two years, several teachers have 
participated in Laying the Foundation training that focuses on pre Advanced Placement skills. One member of our 
history department has worked with the city wide curriculum team on the upcoming shifts on the Global Regents 
exams. Teachers give mock Regents and utilize protocols to analyze results to make instructional decisions. In 2017-
2018, department teams used a fish-bone protocol to choose a yearlong focus on a problem of practice. Throughout 
the year teachers shared student work and lesson plans and implemented department wide strategies to ameliorate 
the issue.  

Based on feedback from Superintendent Conyers in the 2017-2-18 Quality Review Indicator 4.1 (Teacher Feedback) 
and 4.2 (Teacher Teams) we plan to focus on increased capacity of these department teams. Each department team 
will chose from three categories for a year long project: lesson studies, or creation of vertical team alignment 
document of skills/activities,  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, ELA and Math teams will successfully co-create a vertical alignment document resulting in a 2% 
increase in the peer collaboration score on the NYC School Survey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Quality Review for Indicator 4.2 states requires that distributed leadership structures are in place so that teachers 
build leadership capacity and have a voice in key decisions that affect student learning across the school. In 2017-
2018, our goal was to include 80% of teachers in a leadership position as part of a grade, department, instruction or 
school culture teams. While we increased the number of teachers participating in these teams, the leadership of 
many of these teams remained with the administration. In 2018-19, we want to establish teachers as the leaders of 
each of our school teams, including setting agendas, facilitating meetings, overseeing initiatives, and communicating 
progress with the administration. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

By June 2019, in order to distribute and develop teacher leadership, 35% of teachers will hold a leadership position as 
the chair of a department, grade team, or other team, including the school wide instructional team, the House 
steering committee, or membership on the school leadership team.

In the 2017-18 school year, a number of events and initiatives increased parent engagement in the school. Breakfasts 
for parents of new students in September, two student showcases of student performances developed in their 
academic classes as well as after-school clubs, and scheduled days when parents were invited to observe their child's 
classes. However, during the 2017-18 school year attendance at most PTA meetings ranged from 5-15 parents. 
Parents have expressed interest in developing a more active and well attended PTA, in order to organize parent 
events and increase fund-raising efforts.

By June 2019, we will have supported the development of a larger and more independent PTA involving more parents 
in the support of school programs and parent engagement as measured by a 15% increase in attendance PTA 
meetings.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Recruitment: We work closely with a number of colleges and graduate schools that prepare teachers. This list includes 
colleges that partner with us for teacher observations and internships such as Columbia Teachers College, New York 
University, Smith College and Hunter College. With these partnerships, we are able to mentor, support and eventually 
choose from one or more of the interns or their classmates to fill positions in our school. We also look at the Open 
Market list through the DOE’s portal and interview from among the highly qualified teachers who post their resumes 
on the website. In addition we utilize the New Teacher Finder to screen candidates from the NYC Teaching Fellows 
program. 

Retention: Teachers are given the professional discretion to make decisions, under the supervision of the 
administration, concerning curriculum planning, lesson planning, the development of student programs, and the 
advisement of clubs. The administration is committed to a vision of collaborative leadership in which teachers have a 
voice in school-wide decision making and in which veteran teachers take on specific leadership roles. The work begun 
by the School Wide Initiative Team will be continued by the Curriculum Team. We have created a School Culture Team 
as well. Teachers are also supported with encouragement and funding to pursue creative projects and programs that 
will benefit our students. With this collegial and supportive environment, we are able to keep our retention rate very 
high with teachers typically only leaving due to major life changes (move, retirement, etc.) 

Assignments: Teachers are assigned based on the vacancy, their qualifications, and their interests. Teachers ultimately 
have the opportunity to request a placement for the successive year and as determined by contract will have their 
choice at least once every two years. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Providing professional development to our teachers regularly is a cornerstone of our success. Professional 
development is provided both during scheduled weekly sessions led by faculty members or the administration, in 
partnership with outside organizations, including New Visions and The Young Women’s Leadership Network, and in 
off-site workshops and conferences offered by a wide range of organizations including Urban Advantage, Math for 
America, The Gilder-Lehrman Institute, The National Council of Teachers of English, National Council of Teachers of 
Mathematics, National Council of Social Studies Teachers, and the National Coalition of Girls Schools. The

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teachers are empowered to make curricular decisions under the supervision of the administration. Included in this 
decision making is the choice and use of regular assessment to track student progress and improve instruction. 
Teachers are encouraged to design their own assessments as well as use options provided for them including 
EdPerformance, AP for All periodic assessments, QRI, and previous year’s Regents Exams and questions.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met.

2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Young Women’s Leadership School in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of theEvery Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. We communicate regularly with parents by email, autodial, Kinvolved texts and phone calls. 
We invite families to attend student showcases and parent breakfasts.  

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The Young Women’s Leadership School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent support based on the assessed needs l and will 
work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also 
maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before October 30th of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events and activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting morning breakfast meetings both to welcome new parents at the beginning of the school year 
and periodically during the year for parents who cannot attend night time events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written, verbal, and online progress reports to keep parents informed of their children’s progress;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
TYWLS utilizes a variety of tools, including teacher-created assessments in order to guide instructional planning for our ELLS. In 
accordance with the New York State Bilingual Common Core Initiative, instruction will be planned around proficiency in all-four 
modalities. ELLs will also be assessed throughout the year to monitor their progress.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Using the data collected through a variety of tools, including teacher-created assessments, content teachers work closely with 
the ENL teacher to better inform their instruction. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

 

The student’s most recent language-proficiency test (NYSITELL or NYSESLAT) serves as a baseline to inform initial instruction in 
all content areas. These results inform the student’s strongest modality and also informs of the area of need. Throughout the 
year, the ENL teacher assesses students in the four modalities to monitor progress and help determine the areas of need. 
Teacher-created assessments as well as outcome assessments also help inform progress and area of need. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered, teachers make changes inside the classroom. Changes vary from seats/grouping 
to different scaffolds that will help each individual child succeed.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We do not use RTI. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
In order to evaluate and inform our ELL programs, TYWLS uses data pulled from the NYSESLAT, ELA state scores, and Ed 
Performance. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ENL teacher meets with content-teachers during grade-team meetings or department meetings in order to disseminate 
the findings pulled from the outcome assessments for each of the ELL students. In doing so, the ENL teacher can work with the 
teachers to make adjustments to their programs.  The ENL teacher also makes adjustment to instruction for the ENL students. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

With our Freestanding ENL program, ELLs receive services in their content classes with the help of the ENL teacher. 
Both the content teacher and ENL teacher work together to better support each of the students in the class. ELLs are 
blocked in order to allow for co-taught classes although they might be paired or grouped differently within the class. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

We do not have this program. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

We do not have this program. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

As per CR part 154, each student receives the mandated amount of time with the ENL teacher as dictated by their NYSESLAT 
score. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In our Freestanding ENL program, the content area teachers work closely with the ENL teacher to make content accessible for 
ELL students, using scaffolded note taking strategies, frontloading vocabulary and concepts, pre-reading of texts, rewording of 
questions, leveled texts, and sometimes modified assignments and assessments. ELLs also receive small group instruction 
when needed, which could include read aloud, guided questions, small group discussion. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

In order to ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year, ELLs are encouraged to 
use translanguaging in the classroom. ELLs are able to take standardized tests in their home languages, while also being 
provided with the English-language version of the test. They can also use home language glossaries on content area 
assessments. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

We do not have this subgroup at the moment. 
In order to best accommodate Newcomer ELLs , and in addition to the mandated instruction time with ENL teacher, we offer 
small-group (1-1 up to 3-1) tutoring after school with ENL teacher. Instruction is also differentiated by proficiency level and 
grade standards in the four modalities as instructed by the New York State Bilingual Common Core Initiative. 
In order to best accommodate Developing ELLs, and in addition to the mandated instruction time with ENL teacher, instruction 
is also differentiated by proficiency level and grade standards in the four modalities as instructed by the New York State 
Bilingual Common Core Initiative. 
In order to best accommodate Long-Term ELLs, and in addition to the mandated instruction time with ENL teacher, instruction 
is also differentiated by proficiency level and grade standards in the four modalities as instructed by the New York State 
Bilingual Common Core Initiative.   
In order to best accommodate Former ELLs, and in addition to the mandated instruction time with ENL teacher, instruction is 
also differentiated by proficiency level and grade standards in the four modalities as instructed by the New York State Bilingual 
Common Core Initiative.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
All school services correspond to the age and grade levels of the students. The ENL teacher works collaboratively with all grade 
teams in the content areas. Resources, strategies and materials are shared during grade and department meetings. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In order to enable ELL-SWD to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency, ELL-SWD will be appropriately placed into 
ICT and SETSS program classes as per their IEP recommendations, as well as be programmed into the appropriate ENL class. 
ATS reports showing students eligible for ENL services and proficiency levels, as well as ATS report indicating SWD and the 
individual student's IEP will be used to ensure that the student is programmed to receive all services of which they are entitled. 
The ENL teacher collaborates with the Special Education teachers on best instructional practices to reinforce students 
understanding of content area material while also reinforces English language development. SWDs that are ELLs are in 
mainstream classes with non ELL and non SWD students. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The targeted intervention programs for ELLs in 
ELA: Content teachers work closely with the ENL teacher to make content accessible for ELL students, using scaffolding, note 
taking strategies, frontloading of vocabulary and concepts, pre-reading of texts, rewording of questions, leveled texts, 
glossaries, modified assessments and assignments. 
In the case that ELLs get ENL services during ELA class: ELLs are grouped together during instructional time. In doing so, it 
enables the ENL teacher better access to all ELL students in a classroom. ELLs and other students are grouped heterogeneously 
for most other purposes. 
  
Math: Content teachers work closely with the ENL teacher to make content accessible for ELL students, using scaffolding, note 
taking strategies, frontloading of vocabulary and concepts, use of glossaries, pre-reading of texts, rewording of questions, 
leveled texts, modified assessments and assignments. 
  
Social Studies: Content teachers work closely with the ENL teacher to make content accessible for ELL students, using 
scaffolding, note taking strategies, frontloading of vocabulary and concepts,use of glossaries,pre-reading of texts, rewording of 
questions, leveled texts, modified assessments and assignments. 
In the case that ELLs get ENL services during Social Studies class: ELLs are grouped together during instructional time. In doing 
so, it enables the ENL teacher better access to all ELL students in a classroom. ELLs and other students are grouped 
heterogeneously for most other purposes. 
  
Science: Content teachers work closely with the ENL teacher to make content accessible for ELL students, using scaffolding, 
note taking strategies, frontloading of vocabulary and concepts, pre-reading of texts, rewording of questions, leveled texts, 
modified assessments and assignments. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on NYSESLAT scores, formal and summative assessments, a Language Mechanics class, whole-class groupings, more 
collaborative planning opportunities, more ELL-specific PDs for content teachers and more informal assessments throughout 
the year are improvements that will be considered for the upcoming school year. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

This is not applicable to our school. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs, including clubs, tutoring, and mentoring opportunities.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our Newcomers ELLs, Developing ELLs, Long-Term ELLs and ELLs with disabilities all have access to a read aloud program 
(Learning Ally) where they can find all books and manuals used in the different classrooms. Students also have access to 
Grammarly, on-demand translation applications (via Chrome Extensions), in-class Chromebooks, Bilingual dictionaries and 
glossaries.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In our Freestanding ENL program, home language support is assessed and delivered foremost through translanguaging. 
Spanish-speaking ELLs are also assessed in their home language grades 8-11 in Spanish class. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All school services correspond to the age and grade levels of the students. The ENL teacher works collaboratively with all grade 
teams in the content areas. Resources, strategies and materials are shared during grade and department meetings.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We do not share a building with any other school. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 
Incoming 6th graders who are ELLs are invited to an orientation program during the summer. ELLs and their parents are invited 
to Curriculum Night in order to meet teachers and discuss the year ahead. We also offer parent and student orientations in 
May/June as well as in August/September.  As many of the parents of ENL students speak Spanish, we also have our parent 
coordinator present to translate.  When necessary, the counselor and parent coordinator work together with DoE translation 
for any additional outreach.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish is offered as an elective to ELLs. 
For those who speak Spanish at home, we have a native Spanish class that moves much more quickly.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

This is not applicable to our school. 
 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The ENL teacher is encouraged to attend professional development opportunities in order to support ELLs as they engage in 
the Common Core Learning Standard. 50% of the ENL teacher’s professional development must be ELL-specific. 
 
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
As per CR Part 154, all teachers meet the requirements of professional development geared towards ELLs. Records of these are 
kept with the help of agendas and attendance sheets.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
With the assistance of the Parent Coordinator, the ENL teacher meets with parents and when necessary uses the DOE 
translation services to communicate fully with the parents. Teachers also have access to Kinvolved, which translates 
communications via text message in the parents’ prefered language. The ENL teacher also schedules meetings with the parents 
during Parent-Teacher conferences to go over language development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and 
language development needs in all content areas. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

All parents are welcome at school, especially at the monthly PTA meetings and quarterly parent conferences.  We also host 
informal sessions about timely topics.  We use school messenger, email and back packed letters.  When we are targeting a 
particular audience, the parent coordinator and other office staff make phone calls.    
 

 

 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Andrew Higginbotham, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The Parent Coordinator runs RHLA, RBIR, RADP, RAPL, and RADR to determine parents’ home language, students' 
language proficiency, and other biographical information. Our school community requires that all parents 
complete a blue emergency contact card within the first two weeks of school. This information is the reviewed by 
the Language Access Coordinator to determine the languages spoken by parents. All information is reviewed with 
parents when they visit the school and entered into Kinvolved so parents receive text message reminders of 
upcoming events and meetings in their home language.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

As part of our September Professional Development workshops, we discuss ways in which the school and teachers can 
access translation and interpretation services. All teachers have an access to Kinvolved which allows teachers to send 
short text messages that are automatically translated into the parent's language. We encourage the use of Google 
Translate for emails and have several staff members who will interpret for phone conversations.

services.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

 

Our school sends the Language Identification Survey to parents that comes along with a a welcome package students 
receive in September. 

We will utilize the Kinvolved texting application to solicit feedback from parents.
