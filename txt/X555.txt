Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mount Eden Children’s Academy’s mission is to develop students with creative and critical minds, a lifelong love of 
learning, and compassion and courage in order to become successful members of a global society. Students will 
engage in rigorous hands on learning, meaningful enrichment activities, and social emotional learning to support their 
development. We believe that parents, guardians, families, and the community are crucial partners in the success of 
this mission. Students, staff, families and the community will work together to ensure that all students reach their 
fullest potential. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

MECA is truly a community and family school. Students are welcomed by name as they walk into the building daily 
and are seen and supported by multiple staff members each day. Individualized small group instruction occurs 
throughout the day across subjects to ensure that all students are challenged and supported effectively. Students 
engage in hands on, project based activities to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills. We work closely 
with families and the community to provide a holistic approach to student development. This includes close 
partnerships with New Settlement Community Center, Montefiore and Asphalt Green. New Settlement provides 
afterschool programming for students in grades 1-5. They are also our close partner in our health and wellness 
campaign and other school initiatives. Montefiore runs a full clinic on campus. This includes a doctor, nurse, mental 
health, and dental services for the students. Asphalt Green provides swim classes and recess activities for our 
students in support of our health and wellness campaign. We also work closely with MLD Associates and Generation 
Ready to support teacher development and students academics specifically in STEAM, ENL and ELA. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Specific student needs vary from students requiring support services including speech, OT, PT, and counseling, 
students requiring small group academic supports and SETSS, and students who require smaller classroom settings. 
We also are a barrier free school and have students that require health and mobility assistance in the form of 
paraprofessionals and nurse/doctor services delivered on site. Additionally, MECA's population of ELLs is generally 
around 25% each year. Our ELLs range in ability from entering/emerging through expanding/commanding. Many of 
our former ELL students also benefit from continued support services as they transition out of ENL programming.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our key area of focus this year is in the area of rigorous instruction. Our goals are to deepen student engagement in 
critical thinking and problem solving and to incorporate more opportunities for meaningful hands on learning. We 
saw growth last year in student led discussion and reciprocal teaching with a focus on allowing students to further the 
discussion by asking questions to each other, clarifying information, and leading the discussion amongst themselves. 
We would like to continue to build on this while expanding student engagement in ambitious intellectual activities 
that are customized to student needs and abilities.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
We must ensure that our students are engaged in rigorous and meaningful lessons and activities. Additionally, we 
want to provide the students with the time and materials necessary to engage in learning that is designed to promote 
deeper critical thinking and problem solving skills. Based on assessments and data, including state testing data, local 
MOSL scores, classroom data, and TC Running Record data, we have identified the need to target more advanced 
comprehension strategies through more intensive intervention with a focus on ELA and vocabulary development.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, at least 70% of all students will read on or above grade level based on the TCWRP Assessment Kit.

They will meet once a week for common 
planning to review standards, develop rubrics, 
and create goals for their students aligned to the 
CCLS, and modify instruction based on their 
students’ needs as indicated by performance 
data. We have identified the need to target more 
advanced comprehension strategies through 
more intensive intervention with a focus on ELA 
and vocabulary development. 
Scheduling will allow for students to engage in 
reading workshop and guided reading at 
different periods. This will allow teachers to 
focus on grade specific skills and strategies with 
their students and also provide time for students 
to be seen in small groups for support based on 
their individualized reading levels.  

 

  All grades will use vocabulary development 

lessons to strengthen student vocabulary 
throughout the year.  

  Grades K-2 will implement the Fundations 

Phonics program to help strengthen student 
phonemic awareness. Teachers will be trained 
and supported throughout the year in this 
program.  

  All classroom teachers will meet weekly by grade 

for 45 minutes. The planning will be supported 
by our instructional coaches, reading specialist, 
ENL coordinator and administration.  

  Teachers and reading specialists will use focused 
whole group lessons, small group guided reading 
and individual reading conferences to help 
support student growth in comprehension. 
Individualized coaching cycles will be 
implemented for teachers based on their specific 
needs. Coaching cycles will be led by in-house 
instructional coaches and DOE provided literacy 
coach. 

 

Based on 
reading 
assessments, 
all students 
will be 
grouped by 
instructional 
level with no 
more than six 
students per 
group. The 
lowest 1/3 of 
students will 
be seen daily 
by the 
reading 
specialists. 
Other 
students will 
be seen no 
less than four 
times a week 
by classroom 
and/or 
reading 
support 
teachers. 
ELLs will be 
given 
additional 
language and 
literacy 
supports in 
focused ENL 
groupings at 
a minimum 
of 180 or 360 

This goal will be 
implemented on 
September 5 th, 
2018. It is expected 
this goal will be met 
by June 2019.

Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
In order to maintain a safe and supportive environment, it is important to establish and maintain a strong 
collaborative culture that is inviting and safe for all students, staff, and families. As new students and staff come on 
board, it is necessary to ensure clear lines of communication, time for collaboration, and professional development to 
align goals and teaching. Additionally, students need to feel that they are cared for and connected to multiple 
teachers and staff in the building, not just their classroom teacher. As referenced in the School Quality Guide, our goal 
is to continue to improve school culture and increase positivity and collaboration amongst parents, teachers, and 
students.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

Twice weekly, teachers and support staff will meet for common planning, facilitated by coaches, administration and 
consultants, to norm practices, discuss student work, plan lessons, and discuss important noticings. The work in these 
meetings will be further supported by eight targeted Monday professional development sessions based on the data 
that is collected in these meetings. The implementation of this goal will be measured in weekly sign-in sheets, data 
and materials from targeted PD sessions and effective practices in 4e: Growing and Developing Professionally on the 
Danielson rubric. By June 2019, all teachers will participate in three goal setting/revision meetings with 
administration.

nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As a school continues to grow and change it is important to establish clear communication towards common goals in 
order to ensure alignment. Professional development must be aligned to the stated target areas of increased student 
engagement in critical thinking and problem solving and hand on learning activities, specifically in the areas of STEAM, 
ENL and ELA. In addition to clear communication, there also must be opportunity for teachers and staff to provide 
feedback and take ownership of the goals and development that is being done. This will be accomplished through 
formal feedback sessions twice a year and informal sessions as needed. Additionally, teachers and staff will meet with 
administration three times a year to set and monitor individual goals to help them continue to grow as educators.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will meet with the administration at least three times to discuss student data and 
professional goals based on Danielson’s Framework for teaching with a particular focus on engaging students in learning 
and will meet with administration at least twice for formal feedback sessions related to the work and PD surrounding 
MECA's targeted goals. Evidence of success will be measured through goal setting reflections, meeting sign in sheets, 
and an increase in teacher effectiveness as measured on Danielson's Framework.

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
We are committed to finding high quality teachers whose values are aligned with our school mission, vision, values 
and instructional goals. We are also committed to developing new teachers to become highly qualified teachers and 
creating a clear and concrete path for their growth. We have identified high quality teachers through careful 
recruitment strategies through the use of Job Fairs, leads from other professionals, and a rigorous interview process. 
Our strategies for retention include collaboration and opportunities for all staff members to take on leadership roles. 
Additionally, targeted professional development is provided through individualized coaching cycles, professional 
literature clubs and actionable feedback.

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
We are deliberate in how we support our teachers so that they continue to be HQT. They will participate in in-house 
professional development, led by administration, coaches, model teachers, and FSC/District support personnel, as 
well as attend professional development hosted by the Department of Education in specific areas relevant to their 
teaching practice, such as gaining a deeper understanding how to align instruction to CCLS, creating CCLS-based 
assessments, and using student data to differentiate instruction for English Language Learners and students with 
disabilities. We will encourage our staff to attend workshops that will benefit them and in turn improve the academic 
performance of our students. We will ensure that our high quality teachers remain in our school by creating a 
professional learning environment that is safe, respectful and challenging; and by creating a school culture that values 
collaboration and learning, offers relevant professional development opportunities for professional growth, and 
multiple opportunities for staff to contribute to our school development. Specific and individualized coaching cycles 
will be used to provide targeted and differentiated professional development for staff.

Teachers work together with administration, instructional coaches and the data specialist to select and implement 
appropriate multiple assessment measures. Teachers participate on MOSL committee, consultation committee, 
professional development committee, data inquiry teams and assessment selection and revision during common 
planning meetings. Professional development is provided by administration, coaches and the Department of 
Education Early Childhood Offices. Additionally, data inquiry based on students assessments is done in common 
planning during each unit and school wide after benchmark assessments in September, January and June. These 
inquiry sessions are facilitated by administration and the data specialist and afford teachers the opportunity to 
analyze assessment results, identify strengths and identify areas of need with next steps for further planning. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. [School name], in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Every Student Succeeds Act 09X555, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Mount Eden Children's Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:   This program will be an afterschool program for ESL students in all 
grades. It will be an opportunity for students to practice language and literacy skills in English in 
smaller groups with an ESL certified teacher. Students will be grouped by grade level. The five 
teachers leading the program are TESOL certified. The program will begin in January and run 
two days a week afterschool for 1 hour through May for approximately 37 sessions. The 
afterschool program will be taught in English. Teachers will be provided with workbooks, 
reading materials, and listening materials as well as with literacy center materials to use during 
this program. Students will be engaged in guided reading and writing, conversational and 
academic speaking and vocabulary and listening activities including recorded and within the 
group. These activities and materials will be used to supplement the ESL lessons provided 
throughout the school day and to give students a chance to practice listening, speaking, reading 
and writing skills in small groups. Data used to inform flexible grouping includes NYSESLAT 
scores, teacher data and school assessments. The program is intended to support the ongoing 
ENL program ongoing during the school day and to supplement the students in grades 1 through 
5 in language acquisition skills. The materials needed for this program have been previously 
purchased.

  Professional development for Title III teachers will be conducted in house through planning 
meetings, workshops, and coaching cycles provided by our literacy coach and the ESL 
coordinator. Meetings and workshops will be held during the professional development periods 
designated by the DOE on Monday and Tuesday afternoons. Additionally, individualized 
coaching cycles for ESL will be provided on an as needed basis for Title III program teachers by 
the ESL Coordinator. Coaching cycles will last for 6 weeks at a time and the focus, goals, and 
meeting times will be decided by observations, data, and discussions with the 
teacher. Professional development is at no cost to Title III.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Mount Eden Children’s Academy uses preemergent checklists, which assess concepts of print, letter/sound recognition and 
basic sight words. Once students show mastery of these preemergent concepts, they are assessed using TC Running Records. 
The preemergent checklists allow teachers to track development and individualize instruction to the needs of the student. The 
TC Running Records allow us to track growth and progress. They also allow for teachers to assess if a child’s needs fall into 
decoding, retelling, and/or comprehension. Additionally, the use of NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data allows for planning for 
specific ELL needs.       
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

Reading specialists, instructional coaches and testing coordinator oversee the reading testing to ensure that standardized 
administration is clear across classes and grades. Teachers are trained in how to administer these assessments before giving 
them. Teachers do not assess their own students in order to correct for any potential biases.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
ESL teachers meet regularly with the ESL coordinator and administration to discuss the performance of the students. 
Additionally, ELL assessment data is analyzed to track growth and achievement of individual students, groups, and the ESL 
program as a whole. Goals are set for teachers and students and their progress is tracked throughout the year. The main 
assessment used to evaluate the summative success of the ESL program is the NYSESLAT administered annually. Formatively, 
we use in house assessments to track student growth.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Instructional coaches and ENL coordinator oversee individualized coaching cycles for teachers to support their instruction of 
ELLs. Additionally, professional development is provided throughout the year for both ENL and general education teachers to 
ensure that appropriate data inquiry is being done to drive instruction. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
All data is used to assess the growth, understanding, and development of each student. Teachers use the data to track trends 
grade wide, class wide, and for individual students. This information helps ESL teachers to focus in on what strategies can be 
used whole class, in small groups, and 1 on 1. Additionally, this information allows teachers and administration to track the 
success of programs in place. Some assessments that we use are TCWRP running records, writing benchmark tasks, math 
benchmarks and formative testing such as math tests/quizzes, writing conferences, and guided reading groups and 
conferences.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Based on the latest NYSESLAT grades, a majority of our ELL students are Expanding. This is true across all grade levels. 
Additionally, our students score well in listening and speaking across the school. This data indicates that our focus should be 
on reading and writing on a more in depth level, including academic language and vocabulary development, to help our 
expanding students reach Commanding levels in the next year.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Instructional coaches and ENL coordinator oversee individualized coaching cycles for teachers to support their instruction 
of ELLs. Additionally, professional development is provided throughout the year for both ENL and general education teachers 
to ensure that appropriate data inquiry is being done to drive instruction. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

ENL is administered in an integrated setting. One class on each grade level is an inclusive ESL class with about 40% 
ELLs and 60% native English speakers. At least one teacher on each grade level is certified in both TESOL and another 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

applicable certification. ELLs are placed with a classroom teacher who is also TESOL certified. Working closely with the 
ESL Coordinator, these teachers integrate ENL objectives, strategies, and supports throughout the day in ELA and 
Math. Additionally, they are seen in intensive focused groups that are structured to support and meet their specific 
language acquisition needs. This ensures that students get the most from their ENL program. Additionally, they are 
able to receive supports and scaffolding in all academic subjects to help further their language acquisition.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Since ELLs are with a TESOL certified teacher the entire day, all students, Emerging through Expanding are given at least 
180-360 minutes a week. This is to ensure that all students are being supported and given focused language instruction to 
ensure not only command of the English language, but continued success in academia moving forward.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Content areas are delivered in workshop model. Within this model, ESL instruction is delivered only in English with support in 
the native language. All students are instructed in all modalities in order to move them from the beginning level to the 
intermediate, from intermediate to advanced, and from advanced to proficient. All instruction is standards based and ESL 
methodologies and strategies such as scaffolding, TPR, CALLA, moderated speech and inflection, manipulatives, word wall, 
visuals, and graphic organizers are implemented in all lessons. Implementing such practices allows for the development of 
both basic and inter-personal communication skills (BICS) and cognitive academic language proficiency (CALP).      
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Many staff members are bilingual and have the ability to assess in both English and Spanish. Also, the school has a number of 
books on various levels that are Spanish. All students were given an informal evaluation in their native language prior to 
assessment whenever possible.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

b. Newcomer ENL instruction is focused on basic interpersonal communication skills (BICS) as well as listening and speaking 
strategies. Once a mastery of these skills is achieved, the focus is shifted to reading and writing to support the development of 
these skills and academic language.  
c. For developing ELLs, instructional goals are individualized based on student need. Overall, the trend is more towards a focus 
on reading and writing as many of these students have begun to master listening and speaking skills.  
d. Long Term ELLs are almost all on an expanding level. For these students, attention to in depth reading and writing skills are 
the main focus of instruction.  
e. Former ELLs continue to be placed with a certified TESOL teacher for two years after exiting ELL status to ensure that 
supports can be in place for students who need additional scaffolding.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

When working with ELL-SWDs, content is presented in multiple ways to ensure that students have different avenues to achieve 
success. This includes visual representation through pictures and text as well as tactile representation through manipulatives 
and other hands on activities. Instruction is focused on immersion in both the content in the language to aid in development of 
both.       
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Teachers on each grade level meet twice a week for common planning. Within this common planning time, the ESL teacher 
and administration are available to plan with teachers to ensure that the diverse needs of our student population are being 
met. Additionally, curriculum is aligned to the Common Core and is  differentiated in the planning process to meet the needs 
of accelerated and struggling students.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
In ELA, at risk students are pulled daily by the reading specialist for guided instruction. Additionally, students participate in a 
target phonics program for intensive phonics instruction daily through second grade. Students in second grade and up 
participate in Literature class three times a week to help develop critical reading and writing skills in the context on novels. 
During writing, the ESL teacher works with ELLs in guided groups and through conferencing to reinforce the language 
component of the writing mini lesson. For math, teachers include models within their mini lessons that involve manipulatives 
and hands on concrete learning. Additionally, daily assessment of the objective allows teachers to pull focused small groups to 
reinforce the skills and academic language and provide intervention. In science and social studies, students are given hands on 
experiences with concrete models to help understanding. Additionally, pictures and models are used for further engagement 
and small groups are pulled for intervention. Data from formative and summative assessments are used throughout the year 
to identify additional interventions needed. Native language support is given to students where available and appropriate.       
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are considering an afterschool program for language development for students to provide additional focused instruction in 
a targeted area of need based on student assessment. Additionally, we are implementing a vocabulary program to help 
students widen both their academic and daily vocabulary skills.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We currently have no programs or services for ELLs that are being discontinued.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are given all of the same information and opportunities within the school as any other student. Our afterschool program is 
run by New Settlement Community Center on a first come, first serve basis. Saturday Academy for Math and English are 
offered to all struggling students identified by weekly assessments. Additionally, we are looking into an afterschool ENL 
tutoring program as well.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All students have access to technology in the classroom through the use of desktop computers and smartboard activities. All 
teachers and content areas use technology as an engaging and hands on tool to assist in teaching class lessons as well as ENL 
language based lessons. All classes visit the computer lab weekly for at least one period with a technology teacher. Also, 
guided reading and speech services can be supplemented in Spanish for native Spanish speakers.       
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

All information delivered to parents of the ENL program is translated to English and Spanish. Students in the ENL program are 
taught in English but supported in Spanish when needed where possible.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Currently we have ELLs in Kindergarten through 5 th   grade. Support and resources are aligned to the developmental and 
academic needs of these age groups including age appropriate books, manipulatives, and academic and social language.       
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
All students have access to technology in the classroom through the use of desktop computers and smartboard activities. All 
teachers and content areas use technology as an engaging and hands on tool to assist in teaching class lessons as well as ENL 
language based lessons. All classes visit the computer lab weekly for at least one period with a technology teacher. Also, 
guided reading and speech services can be supplemented in Spanish for native Spanish speakers.       
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
During registration, when students are identified as ELLs or eligible for NYSITELL testing, parents are invited to speak with 
administration to discuss options and plans for their child before the school year begins. There is also an open house and a 
student orientation offered for new incoming students. Then, once students are given the NYSITELL, parents are followed up 
with for the Parent Orientation and Parent Survey.      
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Currently there are no language electives offered to ELLs.       
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
TESOL certified teachers are supported in multiple ways. Each week, they meet with the Math instructional coach and Literacy 
Instructional coach for a period each for common planning with their grade. Additionally, ELL teachers meet periodically with 
the ESL Coordinator to ensure rigorous instruction and discuss any questions. Focused PD for ESL teachers will be given during 
Monday afterschool PD periods throughout the year. Also, workshops for all staff members regarding ELLs will be given during 
Monday afterschool PD across content areas. Teachers who need additional supports are also given individualized coaching 
cycles with the ESL Coordinator to focus on specific goals. Additionally, teachers often attend district professional development 
through the DOE.  
All PD mentioned above is focused on achieving mastery of Common Core Learning Standards as well as supporting the 
language acquisition of the ELLs.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
MECA uses the Professional Development time on Mondays as well as Common Planning and meetings with the ESL 
Coordinator to ensure the development of all teachers including both ENL and non-ENL. This year, we will also be 
incorporating a professional book club which will deal with pertinent needs for our school including meeting the needs of 
ELLs.      
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parent meetings are held twice a year for ENL parents to discuss their child, progress, and the program as a whole. This is in 
addition to the parent orientation meeting held at the beginning of the school year and the four DOE scheduled parent-
teacher conferences. These meetings are focused on the needs of our ELLs and allows time for parents to discuss the individual 
needs of their child as well. Translation services are available where needed by multiple bilingual staff in the school building.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents are encouraged to participate in school often. We invite all parents into the building on a daily basis and ask for 
volunteers for many school activities. Specifically for ELL parents, we offer a Saturday ENL class for the parents of our ELLs. This 
was met with a hugely positive response last year and we are expecting to expand it this year to accommodate more parents. 
Additionally, the Parent Coordinator and the Community Coordinator hold workshops throughout the year for parents offered 
in English and Spanish. Translation services are available where needed by multiple bilingual staff in the school building.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jacqueline Radoslovich, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities 
are adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

All parents who are nonEnglish speakers are Spanish speakers. MECA employs multiple teachers and support staff 
who are fluent in Spanish. Many staff members, including the parent coordinator, can read and write fluently in 
Spanish as well. This ensures that all parents who communicate with the school can be responded to in their 
native language. Also, all correspondence that leaves the building is given out in both English and Spanish. ATS 
reports of parent preferred languages, blue card data, teacher surveys and parent surveys are used to keep an 
updated record of parent's preferred home language.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

your school 

Face to face interactions with parents occur at formal times 
throughout the year (including the four parent/teacher nights and 
school activities such as the spring show) and informally on a daily 
basis. Informally, in addition to the parent engagement that occurs 
during workshops, meetings, and via teacher meetings, emails and 
phone calls, our parents come to the classroom each afternoon to 
pick up their child which allows for a brief face to face interaction 
with their child's teacher on a daily basis.

All parents who are nonEnglish speakers are Spanish speakers. MECA employs multiple teachers and support staff 
who are fluent in Spanish. Many staff members, including the parent coordinator and community assistant, can read 
and write fluently in Spanish as well. This ensures that all parents who communicate with the school can be 
responded to in their native language. Also, all correspondence that leaves the building is given out in both English 
and Spanish. Written translation services will be provided in house by the secretary, parent coordinator and 
community assistant. All materials to be sent home to parents will be handed in in English to the office for translation. 
This ensures that all material will be translated quickly and efficiently. Oral translation services will be provided in 
house by school staff. Teachers, administration, and support staff that speak Spanish will be on hand at all times for

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

In addition to the parent survey, there is a suggestion box in the office that parents can give feedback either signed or 
anonymously. The administration are outside in the mornings speaking informally with parents and answering 
questions. Additionally in the afternoon, parents see their child's teacher daily during pick up.
