Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

K.A.P.P.A Vision – K.A.P.P.A scholars will be tomorrow’s leaders and problem solvers. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

K.A.P.P.A Mission – The K.A.P.P.A. mission is to provide our scholars with the academic, career, intrapersonal and 
interpersonal skills necessary for success in high school, college and the competitive world. 

K.A.P.P.A Motto – The K.A.P.P.A motto is "Education is our Passport to the Future..." 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Knowledge Power and Preparatory Academy (x215) K.A.P.P.A is a grade 6 – 8 middle school housed at the Dr. 
Charles R. Drew Educational Complex in the Morrisania section of the Bronx. The facility is shared with the New 
Venture STEAM Academy (x219): and Frederick Douglass Academy III (x517). K.A.P.P.A was established as a program 
in September, 2000 and was the first replicated school in Community School District #9. It was replicated after KIPP 
Charter School in partnership with Replications, Inc which was founded by John Elwell. There are currently four 
KAPPAs that have been replicated after our school. KAPPA is unique in that our scholars hail from communities 
located in Community Districts 9 and 10. Our scholars apply to KAPPA via the Middle School Choice Program. As a 
result, the student population is economically and ethnically diverse. Students and their families hail from Central 
America, South America, Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. Even though approximately 15% of our students are 
identified as English Language Learners, the vast majority of our students actually speak a second language at home. 
This adds to the uniqueness of our school. What these diverse students have in common is that they value education. 
This is a direct result of strong parental support at home. 

 

K.A.P.P.A is currently in its eighteenth year as an educational institution and thirteenth year as an autonomous school 
recognized by the New York State Education Department. As per the New York State Education Department, 
K.A.P.P.A. has been in good academic standing since its establishment as an autonomous school.  

 

 

Strategic Collaborations/Partnerships 

KAPPA has developed strategic collaborations/partnerships with institutions and agencies that promote literacy, 
nurture youth leadership, help students become college and career ready and facilitate professional collaborations 
among staff. 

School’s Out NYC (S.O.N.Y.C) – KAPPA, in partnership with the Xposure offers a 5 day – 3 hour after school program 
that provides homework help, animation, dance, scriptwriting and video production. Students also participate in 
recreational, athletic, and educational trips. 

Algebra for All - Select teachers and an Assistant Principal participate in this initiative which makes Algebra education 
accessible to all students in middle school.  

Urban Advantage - Select teachers and an Assistant Principal participate in this initiative which promotes inquiry -
based learning, STEM education and text to world connections in Science. 

STEM A+ labs - A $200,000 grant was received from Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz, Jr. and Councilwoman 
Vanessa Gibson in order to improve, increase, and integrate technology in Science. Each Science teacher is 
incorporating the use of digital Science labs into their Science curriculum. Students also learning Robotics, 
programming Nanobots, and use digital software to create three-dimensional objects via the use of a 3D printer. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Every Science teacher, the Physical Education teacher, and an Assistant Principal has/will receive professional 
development in the successful utilization of the A+ STEM labs.  

The Girl Scouts of Greater New York - KAPPA, in partnership with the Girl Scouts of America, hosted six-week coding 
program for girls. We anticipate establishing a Girl Scout Troup or the 2018-2019 school year. 

 

Special Initiatives

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The English Language Learner population has improved their scores on the NYSESLAT. However, KAPPA has had 
difficulty retaining certified ENL teacher. The current ENL teacher has returned to the school due to excessing rights.  

The current Math teacher for the sixth grade Self-Contained class and SETSS provider has been on a Restoration of 
Health leave of absence since November 7th, 2017. As a result, students will be receiving instruction from a long term 
Substitute until the Special Education teacher returns. 

The Students in Temporary Housing (STH) have extreme financial difficulties. These students have been given 
uniforms and school supplies in order to help them thrive in the school. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which KAPPA made the most progress over the past year was 
Strengthening Family-Community Ties and Trust. In the element of Strengthening Family-Community Ties there was a 
0.2% increase. In the area of Trust, there was a 0.48% increase.  

The key areas of focus for the 2018-2019 school year are Rigorous Instruction and Collaborative Teaching. There was 
0.23% decrease in the rating for Rigorous Instruction. In Mathematics, we have planned for each Math class to begin 
with 30 minutes of engagement in the 5 Practices for Orchestrating Mathematical Discussions. Also, in Mathematics, 
students will receive remediation using Ready workbooks that are one grade below their actual grade-level. In the 
area of Collaborative Teaching, all teachers have daily common planning time with teachers who teach the same 
grade and subject. In Mathematics, grade 6 and 8 teachers have an opportunity to plan both vertically and 
horizontally on a daily basis.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Rigorous Instruction (KAPPA strengths)- 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey 

ELA - There was a 7% increase in the number of students performing at a proficient level on the New York State exam. 
In 2017, 32% of the students were proficient and in 2018, 39% of the students were proficient.  

Math - There was a 3% increase in the number of students performing at a proficient level on the New York State 
exam. In 2017, 18% of the students were proficient and in 2018, 21% of the students were proficient. 

Rigorous Instruction (KAPPA priority needs)- 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey 

ELA - Even though the overall level of proficiency is above 40% (New York State ELA exam 2018) for students in grades 
6 and 8, the level of proficiency for last year's grade 7 students was 29.2%. When this cohort is compared to itself, 
they had an 8% increase as they matriculated from grade 6 to grade 7. The priority is for 40% of this cohort (current 
8th grade students) to perform at performance level 3 or higher. 

Math - The overall level of proficiency is 21% (New York State Mathematics exam 2018). The priority is to increase the 
proficiency level to 30% based on the New York State Mathematics exam 2019.  

Math - Even though 96% of the students that took the Common Core Algebra Regents passed the exam, the priority is 
to increase the number of students scoring 85% or better by 5%.  

Living Environment - Based on the 2018 Living Environment Regents exam, 50% of the students passed. We would like 
to increase the percentage of students passing by 10%.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 09X215, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

 

Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all parents/guardians, 
including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our school community will 
conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy with Title I parents 
to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation through school surveys and feedback 
forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I 
program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

 
 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

The Direct Instructional Supplement program is designed to move long term ELLs, along the 
continuum in the area of Literacy instruction so that they can ultimately transition out of needing 
ELL services.  In order to meet the AMAO targets and the Common Core Learning Standards 
(CCLS) the program will focus on academic language reading and writing skills.  The program 
will use a variety of tailored materials that are genre specific and differentiated to enable ELLs to 
meet the AMAO targets and rigors of the CCLS.  Students will receive daily instruction that 
focuses on the English language. Instruction will include explicit teaching of elements of English 
(e.g., vocabulary, syntax, and conventions), conversational conventions (e.g., taking turns and 
signaling disagreement), and strategies for how to learn the language (e.g., taking notes, paying 
selective attention, and summarizing). 
According to the 2016 NYSESLAT data based on 51  ELLs: 6% of the ELLs scored at the 
Entering on the NYSESLAT. 12% scored at the Emerging level and 27% scored at the 
Transitioning level.  55% scored at the Expanding level. 8 students tested at the Commanding 
level on the 2016 NYSESLAT. 
The Direct Instructional Supplement program will serve ELLs in grades 6 through 8.  Thirty 
three percent (17) of the students being served also have IEPs (Based on 2016-2017 data).   
The Direct Instructional Supplement Program will occur after school.  All students will  be able 
to attend an after-school program that will be scheduled on Wednesdays and  Thursdays for 2 
hours each (2:15 pm - 4:15 pm).  Grade 6 students will be able to attend the after school program 
on Wednesdays.  Grade 7 and 8 students will attend the after school program on Thursdays.  The 
after school program will begin in mid January, 2017 and conclude at the end of May, 
2017. There will be approximately 18 sessions for each grade.     
The language of instruction for the program will be English. 
In order to provide the students with home language support, students will be able to access the 
online program Achieve 3000 to complete remedial, extension, and stretch activities.in their 
home language, if preferred and available. 
Attendance in the after school program will be taken daily and maintained in an after school 
attendance folder by the teacher.  Copies of all correspondence, sent home will also be 
maintained by the instructor in a folder.  
Grade students will be grouped as one instructional group and the students in grades 7 and 8 will 
be grouped in another instructional group.  There will be approximately 25 students in each 
group.  The student to adult ratio will be approximately 1:25.. One classroom will be used for 
each session. 
Professional Development has been/ will be provided by Achieve 3000 - September 2016, 
January 2017.  The name of the consultant is Nando Prudhomme.  Professional development will 
also be provided by Attanasio & Associates for the "Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT," 
curriculum.  The name and credentials of the consultant and dates of the professional 
development are to be determined. 
A certified ESL teacher will facilitate the extended day program 
The types of materials to be used will be as follows:

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
  
  
Professional Development, for English Language Learners, is needed for all teachers at 
K.A.P.P.A. Since students are grouped heterogeneously throughout all grades, it is imperative 
that all teachers learn pedagogical strategies designed to improve the Literacy of all ELLs.  Even 
though there are 52 identified ELLs at K.A.P.P.A, there are many who are unidentified because 
the vast majority of students speak a language other than English at home. 
Professional Development will occur during the Chancellor's Conference Days and during team 
planning sessions. It will  also be provided by external consultants, such as BFSC personnel.  It 
is anticipated that the professional development will be at no cost to the school. 
Recommended topics to be covered: 
Vocabulary Development 
Common Core Learning Standards and ELLs 
Differentiation 
Scaffolding Language and Learning 
From Speaking to Writing in the Content Classroom 
Reading and Writing in a Second Language 
 
Identifying appropriate resources 
It is our hope that the teachers will,be able to incorporate the skills/strategies learned, at 
professional development workshops, into their daily instructional practices.   Consequently, this 
should improve students' performance on New York State assessments as well as the 
NYSESLAT. 
 
Records of professional development that is provided on site will be maintained at the 
school.  Copies of all agendas, sign-in sheets, and supporting documents will be maintained in 
the main office.

Begin description here:            
  
A wide variety of parent engagement activities are targeted toward parents of ELLs. These 
activities are designed to help parents become acclimated to the school and provide them with 
support as their children matriculate, while at KAPPA 
Meetings are held 1-2 times a month and last for at least 2 hours. 
Parents are notified of these activities via the monthly calendar, fliers, and announcements via 
the school messenger service.  Written correspondence will be translated into languages that can 
be translated.  Translation, in Spanish, will be provided at each event by various staff.  French, 
will be provided by staff on an as needed basis.  
Copies of all attendance sheets, agendas, fliers, and supporting documents are maintained in a 
folder in the main office.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
In order to guide instructional planning for ELLS, a wide variety of data are used.  
 
NYSESLAT data are examined.  The data revealed that 51% of the ELLS are performing at the Expanding level.  It also showed 
that the students are mostly deficient in the writing and reading comprehension sections of the NYSESLAT.  Approximately 
78% of the ELLs received a writing score of 6 or less.  It also showed that 53% of the students received a score 14 or less on the 
reading comprehension section of the NYSESLAT. 
 
All students are administered an ELA diagnostic in late September. This data informs all teachers what specific skills students

struggle to master. Based on the data, classroom teachers classroom teachers revise unit/lesson plans to differentiate and 
scaffold instruction.   
 
The insights that this data provides is that the majority of ELL students encounter difficulty writing.  specifically, students have 
challenges with paragraph organization, clarity, sentene structure and usage. 
 
ELLs will also take an IReady assessment in November, the dta from this assessment will be used to further revise unit and 
lesson plans. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Students will complete beginning of year, mid year and end of year assessments in writing.  Students will have their writing 
instruction scaffolded with the use of writing prompts, graphic organizers, etc.  The NTC analysis guide will be used to analyze 
assessment data and make revisions to instruction 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The summative assessments that will be used are the following: 
 
New York City Performance Tasks 
English Language Learner Baseline Assessment 
I-READy beginning of year and mid year assessments 
 
Based on current data, identified areas of need are: 
 
organization of writing 
sentence structure 
identifying claims 
citing relevant evidence to support claims 
all aspects of reading comprehensions 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered, the ESL teacher, ELA teachers and members of the LAP Team analyze the dat 
using the NTC- Analyzing Student Work Protocol.  An area of focus is identified based on a common skill that the vast majority 
of students are experiencing challenges with.  Students receive instruction that is differentiated and/or scaffolded in order to 
provide them with academic supports.  After a 6 to 8 week cycle, stuents are given another assessment and the data are 
analyzed to see if there was progress in the area of need.  If there is significant progress, another area of focus is identified.  If 
there is little to no progress, that skill is maintained as an area of focus and additional revisions are made. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We currently do not have any k - 5 classes at our school. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Outcome assessments that are used to evaluate and inform our ELL programs are:  Living Environment Regents, Common Core 
Algebra Regents New York State ELA and Math exams, New York City Performance Tasks, and I-Ready. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ELL Data Analysis will be used to disaggregate data  to make revisions to instruction.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The stand-alone ENL class is facilitated in 90 minute blocks.  The 90 minute lesson consist of the following 
components: reading comprehension, vocabulary development, grammar/ language arts and independent reading.  In 
this class, students who have scored at the entering/emerging levels are placed into un-graded groups.  The remaining 
students who need instruction in 90 minute blocks are placed in the un-graded heterogeneous groups 
The Integrated ENL (push-in) program is based on the idea that pulling students out of their classrooms can prevent 
students from fully integrating into the classroom and that students will miss class work while they are 
gone.  Integrated ENL (push in) means that the ENL teacher comes into the classroom to service students for the 
mandated time as per CR Part 154.  It is extremely important for the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher work 
closely together to meet the academic needs of ELL students.  The ENL teacher and the classroom teacher collaborate 
on the unit of study to determine the various ways the ENL teacher will work in the classroom.  One way is for the ENL 
teacher to team-teach with the subject teacher.  The ENL teacher and the English Language Arts teacher (ELA) take 
turns delivering lessons, with the ENL teacher focusing on providing scaffolding and addressing more basic skills.  The 
ENL teacher also provides ideas and materials for differentiating and scaffolding instruction for the general education 
teacher.  A second option is for the ENL teacher to pull a small group of ELLs during independent work time to 
reinforce or re-teach a skill.  This can also be a time to teach more basic language skills or grammar points.  A third 
way for the ENL teacher to service the students is to sit with the students one on one to assess reading and writing 
skills during independent reading and writing work time. The skills addressed during the one-on-one sessions are 
aligned to the ELA teacher’s unit of study. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not Applicable 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Not Applicable 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           According to their grade and proficiency levels, ELL students receive a mandated (CR PART 154) number of units of study 
(a unit is 180 minutes per week).   Entering/Emerging and Transitioning level students will receive 360 minutes of ESL 
instruction.   Expanding ELL students will receive 180 minutes of ESL instruction. The ESL teacher pushes in to work with every 
ESL student four days a week, for a 45-minute period for the Commanding students.  Entering/Emerging students are seen five 
days a week for two 45 minute periods a day.  ELL students also receive targeted ELA/ESL instruction during the extended day 
program. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Differentiated instruction is delivered in all content areas subjects including ESL.  Webb’s Depth of Knowledge questions are 
used on a daily basis during instruction.  Students are placed in various groupings that that include small group, individual, 
partner and whole group instruction.  Students are encouraged to identify individual and group learning goals. 
Accomplishments are readily supported through verbal and written feedback.. KAPPA has heterogeneously grouped classes in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

grades 6 - 8. ESL groups are arranged by grade level.  The students' proficiency levels are based on the LAB-R, NYSESLAT and 
informal assessment results. The ESL teacher pushes into each ELA class for a 45 -minute period during either the reader or 
writer’s workshop.   The ESL teacher will work with ELLs to introduce academic vocabulary, build prior knowledge and develop 
fluency and comprehension in academic English reading and writing in order to meet the needs of the Common Core.   
  
     Students who are pulled out receive 90 minute lessons using the Achieve 3000 curriculum.  This curriculum provides 
ongoing assessments and focuses on reading comprehension, vocabulary development and writing. 
 
 
 
    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   A full bilingual program requiring native language instruction is not offered in this school. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

At the beginning of the academic year all classroom teachers receive a list of ELL students in their class along with their English 
proficiency levels. 
 
The instructional plan for SIFE students is to provide them with multiple access points to the curriculum.  One third af all 
classroom libraries are leveled.  SIFE students are encouraged to select books based on their lexile levels.  In addition to 
leveled libraries, each classroom has an ENL Center that contains resources such as:  multiple copies of a 
dictionary//thesaurus, sentence starters, and other reading and writing materials.  SIFE students have open access to these 
resources to support them in completing reading and writing activities.  SIFE students are also strongly encouraged to attend 
any after-school or Saturday School programs offered throughout the school year.  
 
Newcomers will receive one–on-one instruction with the ESL teacher while being immersed in English in their classrooms. 
Several methodologies will be incorporated, such as visual aids, total physical response and use of their native language in 
instruction as allowable. Once students are required to take the New York State ELA examination, newcomer ELLs are required 
to attend ELA/ESL after school programs.  Newcomers also receive pull-out instruction using the Waterford or Smartstart 
reading program. 
For long-term ELL students, the targeted intervention is focused on improving and supporting academic writing skills.   These 
skills can include: 
"- Writing Strategies, which involves teaching students strategies for planning, revising, and editing their compositions 
- Summarization, which involves explicitly and systematically teaching students how to summarize text 
 Collaborative Writing, which uses instructional arrangements in which adolescents work together to plan, draft, revise, and 
edit their compositions 
-. Specific Product Goals, which assigns students specific, reachable goals for the writing they are to complete 
- Word Processing, which uses computers and word processors as instructional supports for writing assignments 
- Sentence combining, this involves teaching students to construct more complex, sophisticated sentences 
- Pre-writing, which engages students in activities designed to help them generate or organize ideas for their composition 
- Inquiry Activities, which engages students in analyzing immediate, concrete data to help them develop ideas and content for 
a particular writing task 
-Process Writing Approach, which interweaves a number of writing instructional activities in a workshop environment that 
stresses extended writing opportunities, writing for authentic audiences, personalized instruction, and cycles of writing  
- Study of Models, which provides students with opportunities to read, analyze, and emulate models of good writing 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

- Writing for Content Learning, which uses writing as a tool for learning content material "(Graham, S., & Perin, D. (2007). 
Writing next: Effective strategies to improve writing of adolescents in middle and high schools – A report to Carnegie 
Corporation of New York. Washington, DC:Alliance for Excellent Education. We also pay special attention to the needs of those 
students who pass the NYSESLAT.  Differentiated instruction is provided according to age and grade level for the two year 
extension. 
 
Developing ELLs receive instruction that is differentiated and they also receive scaffolds to provide them with support during 
the lessons.  Writing and reading tasks are differentiated for them.  For example in writing, they may receive modified writing 
assignments,  sentence starters, writing prompts, graphic organizers and outlines.  In reading, they may read 
abridged  versions of texts, graphic novels in lieu of full novels, and they may listen to audios of texts while they read the 
actual text. 
 
Former   ELLs receive scaffolded and differentiated instruction on an as need basis.` 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
In order to reach all learners, all teachers use a variety of strategies to provide access to academic content areas and to 
accelerate English language developments. These strategies include: Universal Design for Learning, multiple entry points, and 
small group instruction. 
 
Modified /abridged versions of grade level texts, graphic novels. and audio books are used to provide access to grade-level 
academic content. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In order to achieve ELL-SWDs IEP goals and attain English proficiency in the least restrictive environment the school uses 
curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility by providing push in ELL services and push in SETSS. Also, these students are 
given opportunities to attend academic after-school programs 4 times a week instead of twice a week (general education) In 
addition, the teachers of these students have  common planning periods that allow for the examination of student work and 
differentiated lesson planning.  Paste response to question here:    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
This academic year ELA/Social Studies and Science curriculum has targeted interventions such as; using vocabulary as a 
curriculum anchor: using visual to reinforce concepts and vocabulary; implementing cooperative learning; using visuals to 
reinforce concepts and vocabulary; and modeling cognitive and academic language demands.  Vocabulary development is 
integrated with all aspects of the ELA instructional program.  During the Math Skills period, the teacher will provide additional 
support for ELL students who have difficulty keeping up with day to day expectations.  This period is also designed to detect 
and provide ongoing support to students before they fall behind. Selection of instructional materials and activities is intended 
to support student learning during class time. In all classes special settings and supplemental instruction are provided by the 
classroom teacher. ELL students are required to attend an after school program in ELA and math taught by an ESL teacher and 
a math teacher who incorporates ESL methodologies in his/her targeted instructional program.  ESL classes are taught in 
English. The after school program is designed to assist with transitional ELLs attaining commanding level on the NYSESLAT.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

  Kappa is thinking of adding a Saturday program.   We would like to utilize listening centers to help students improve their 
performance on the NYSESLAT 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs will be discontinued.    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All students have equal access to all school programs. ELL students are offered the opportunity to participate in all regular 
school, after school learning programs. ELLs are encouraged to participate in activities such as; Student Government, Yearbook 
Club and Math Club.   
 
During the 2017-2018 school year, ELLS will have the opportunity to participate in an after-school program that focuses on 
reading comprehension and writing.  They will also have the opportunity to participate in a Saturday Academy that focuses on 
NYSESLAT test preparation. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Expeditionary Learning, Eureka Math, and Achieve 3000 are instructional materials used to support ELLs.   Students engage 
with their peers in academic conversation and can study models of the four modalities of English acquisition.  Technologies 
used to support ELLs are smart boards, document cameras, laptops and listening centers. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

All students are taught in English in the ESL program.  ELL students have access to bilingual student materials such as, 
dictionaries and content thesaurus, if needed.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Teachers use the Universal Design Learning instructional strategies to design, develop and deliver instruction that effectively 
meet the ages and grade levels of the ELL.  Children’s cultural background and prior knowledge are often used to develop 
effective programs to meet the ELLs' specific learning needs. All required services support, and resources correspond to ELLs 
ages and grades.  In ELA, we use the Expeditionary Learning curriculum which is also the New York State EngageNY 
curriculum.  In Social Studies, we use the Passport curriculum which is also the New York State EngageNY curriculum.  In 
Mathematics, we use Eureka Math which is also the New York State EngageNY curriculum. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The building is a co-located building however, we do not share resources as it relates to the ELLs. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
All staff members know that entering a new school can be overwhelming, especially if the newcomer doesn’t speak English. To 
make the experience as welcoming as possible for new students, pedagogues are notified to initiate testing and determine if 
the students is eligible for ELL services.  All efforts are made to get the newcomer to meet other students who speak their 
language.  A helpful tool is to introduce a newcomer to a native peer, so that he or she can begin immediately to hear and 
repeat the sounds of the new language.  All classroom teachers are encouraged to pay special attention to the newcomers to 
help them make a successful transition.   The new student may have questions that are still unanswered a special meeting is 
held.  Newly enrolled students and their parents and guardians are offered a full day orientation, a week long orientation for 
5th graders and a celebratory barbeque prior to the beginning of the school years.  All subjects and clubs are offered to ELL 
students      
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

No language electives are currently offered to students.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
As per the professional development calendar, professional development for ELLs will be provided during the month of 
January.  The focus of these sessions will be: differentiation for ELLs, scaffolding instruction for ELLS, vocabulary development 
for ELLS, improving reading comprehension for ELLs and  improving writing for ELLS. 
 
 
The ESL teacher will attend a minimum of 4 professional development sessions offered by the BFSC.  Some of the the 
professional development topics will be self-selected by the ESL teacher based on her individual pedagogical needs and others 
will be recommended based on the individual and collective needs of the students. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
K.A.P.P.A will meet the professional requirements as per CR Part 154.2 in several ways.  
 
During the month of January, four - five hours of professional development will be offered  to all teachers during Professional 
Development Mondays.  Topics will Include differentiation, providing scaffolds, improving reading comprehension and writing 
of ELLs.  Professional Development will be provided by members of the Borough field Office as well as the ESL teacher. 
 
During the Chancellor's Conference Day in November, 2 - 3 hours of Professional Development will be provided for ESL 
instruction.  The focus will be ESL strategies in content area subjects. 
 
Throughout the course of the year, teachers will be given opportunities to attend professional development off-site.  This 
professional development may be provided by the Borough Field Office, New York City Department of Education or other 
agencies/organizations recognized by the New York City Department of Education or the New York State Education 
Department 
 
This professional development is required for all pedagogues, administrators and paraprofessionals. Educational articles and 
books which focus on ELL instruction will be read throughout the year. There are no occupational therapists/ physical 
therapists currently working at K.A..P.P.A.   
 
All agendas, attendance forms, fliers, certificates of completion, etc. will be maintained in a folder in the main office

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Annual Individual Meetings, with parents of ELLs, will be facilitated during the months of January and February.  Fliers, 
announcing the meetings, will be distributed to all ELLs and the Parent Coordinator and ESL teacher will call each individual 
family to invite them to the event. 
 
At these meetings, results from beginning of the year and mid-year assessments will be distributed and explained to 
parents.  Exemplars of student work and portfolios will be shared with parents.  Parent handbooks that focus on test taking 
tips, homework support, bullying etc. will be made available in multiple languages.  In addition, parents/guardians will receive 
individual work packets that the students can work on while at home. 
 
Spanish interpretation will be provided by Mrs. Arias the school counselor.  Interpretation in other languages  will be provided 
using the New York City Department of Translation and Interpretation Unit. 
 
Attendance sheets, parent-contact logs, fliers advertising the event and copies of all resources shared will be maintained by

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Sheri Warren, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
