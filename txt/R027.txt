Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission of Anning S. Prall Intermediate School 27 is to provide a nurturing environment in a small school setting 
to enable all students to perform successfully in school and prepare them for College and Career Readiness. We 
engage students to develop an appreciation for human experience and encourage them to think independently and 
analytically while strengthening their skill of self-expression through an academically rigorous education. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

All academies will have a diverse musical encore program including band, chorus, drama, musical theatre as well as 
technology, virtual enterprise, journalism, visual arts, current events, and Lego Robotics. Each academy will have 
special programs to promote academic performance for special needs students. Also, our Saturday Academy is geared 
to support ENL, Students with Disabilities and At Risk students in English Language Arts and Math. Each academy will 
have academic enrichment programs including, but not limited to, Integrated Algebra and Science Regents Classes 
and the Scholars Program. All students will have access to Extended Day and Saturday Academy including Sports and 
Arts in Schools Foundation, as well as, academic intervention services in ELA, Math and Science. Students are 
encouraged to conduct community service throughout their years at IS 27 and so we work in conjunction with the 
Salvation Army Food and Clothing Collection, Notre Dame Bread of Life, Breast Cancer Walk, Jump Rope for Heart, 
March of Dimes Walk and a variety of neighborhood clean-up programs [snow shoveling, leaf removal, etc.]. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our special student populations includes Integrated Co-teaching classes, 12:1, 12:1:1, Scholars, Honors. All students 
need an array of instructional challenges and modifications based on their needs. The needs of the students may 
include behavioral, social emotional, intellectual, physical and hearing and language impaired. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Based on the data from the 2016-2017 Quality Review Report, we had areas of celebration specifically in school 
culture: Maintaining a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the academic and personal growth 
of students and adults. In The Framework from Great School Report, we had areas of celebration specifically in the 
area of quality professional development. We also saw growth in effective school leadership in the area of program 
coherence and instructional leadership. This year we are going to focus on curriculum that is engaging, rigorous, and 
coherent in all subjects. All curriculum will be accessible for a variety of learners and aligned CCLS and/or content 
standards to ensure equity and excellence for all learners. The school will also focus on improving Math scores for all 
students. Math teachers will receive ongoing Professional Learning, as well as, individual coaching through Algebra 
For All & NTN. 

The School Instructional Focus is: If we plan for coherent, engaging and differentiated instruction, thus ensuring

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

The school’s strength and area of celebration on the Quality Review Report 2016-2017 is maintaining a school culture of 
mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the academic and personal growth of students and adults. This year we 
continue to divide the school up into three vertical academies. This allows teachers to look at student work in 
interdisciplinary teams as well as investigate the trends across grade levels. By utilizing the School Performance 
Dashboard and the item analysis of the ELA and Math State test scores from 2018 we are going to identify Common 
Core standard focus strands and utilize this information to reinforce those strands on a daily basis. The school needs to 
increase the academic level of performance for all students with a special emphasis for ENL students and special needs 
students, by utilizing Advance to increase student engagement and deepen student understanding by using assessment 
in instruction and continue to use questioning and discussion techniques. These techniques foster student to student 
questioning and discussion, student engagement, as well as student and teacher assessment in learning as evidenced by 
teacher to student and student to student interactions. Activities are aligned with instructional outcomes designed to 
challenge student thinking resulting in most students actively participating in every observed lesson.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

1. IS 27 professional learning community meetings provide 
teachers with the opportunity to collaborate each Monday. This 
collaboration addresses the instructional expectations included in 
Advance, through Advance component study. It also organizes 
teachers into impact teams based on the areas that they have 
identified in their own professional goals that were established in 
September 2018. These Impact Teams meet weekly on Monday 
and/or Tuesdays and focus on our students with disabilities, 
English language learners and our economically disadvantaged 
students. Teachers will discuss scaffolds and resources to support 
these students to meet the Common Core Learning Standards and 
ensure that there is equity and excellence for all learners. The 
focus of this work will involve Tenets 3, 4, and 5. 

2. Teacher Leads attend professional learning as part of the 
Dissemination Grant monthly. Core teachers will serve as Advance 
coaches and perform coaching observations in the building each 
month. Teachers will focus on planning and preparation and 
include differentiation for our lower, middle and higher 
performing students throughout their lessons. This work will focus 
on Tenets 4 and 5.

Part 5 – Progress Monitoring  

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By October 31, 2018 teachers will complete a short term analysis on their growth based on their data from the 
Advance System. From this data analysis, teachers will select best practices workshops on Election Day and 
Chancellor's Conference Day to enhance their teaching practice to Effective and Highly Effective in Component 1a: 
Knowledge of Content Pedagogy and 1e: Designing Coherent Instruction. By our Midyear Assessment in February 
2019 teachers will analyze the midyear data from the Advance system. Administration will use that data to script 
specific professional development based on teacher and student needs. 

 

By the end of February 2019, School leaders will analyze the data based on components 1a: Knowledge of Content 
Pedagogy and 1e: Designing Coherent Instruction for each teacher on the Advance System to measure their impact

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

After review of Advance components 2B and 2D, we have found that most teachers effectively create an environment of 
respect and rapport, and manage their classrooms with regard to behavior while, taking into account the needs of each 
student and respect their students’ dignity. After reviewing the K-8 Quality Snapshot, it has been determined that 65% 
of students feel safe in the hallways, bathrooms, locker rooms and cafeteria and 80% of students say that teachers treat 
them with respect. Additionally, 92% of our parents feel that the principal works to create a sense of community in the 
school. To further build upon an environment that is supportive to all learners, school leaders and teachers will work 
collaboratively to create rigorous lessons designed to enhance instruction and ensure that all students are being 
presented with rigorous and challenging instruction to move them to the next level. Progress will be reflected on our 
environment surveys as well as advance teacher data. Also, the data from the Quality Review Report 2016-2017 
indicated a rating of well-developed in a Positive Learning Environment for School Culture which was our area of 
celebration. We will continue with the program, Safe Public Spaces which promotes positive school culture, strategies 
for de-escalation, restorative practices and social and emotional learning for all students.

impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-need 
student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE, 
STH). 

1. Principal and Assistant Principals will set up and follow a schedule 
for teacher observations and feedback as it relates to this research 
based rubric quarterly. Formal observation questioning techniques 
based on Depth of Knowledge, and Bloom’s Taxonomy will be 
utilized to provide feedback to teachers. Assistant Principals will also 
review classroom physical space for environment conducive to 
active student engagement. 

2. Administrators will provide feedback to teachers quarterly 
identifying rigor in the classroom, and how to improve upon 
differentiating instruction for our students with disabilities, English 
language learners, and our economically disadvantaged. All students 
will be presented with rigorous activities aligned to the Common 
Core Learning Standards to ensure equity and excellence for all 
students. 

3. Families and school staff will engage in regular, two-way, 
meaningful communication about their children's learning weekly. 
This will be done primarily through the use of Pupil Path, as well as 
during Parent Engagement Tuesdays. 

 

4. We have also adopted the program, Safe Public Spaces, which 
aims to establish a safe and supportive school environment by 
training all members of our school’s staff to promote positive 
student behaviors and interactions, and prevent, understand, and 
respond to disciplinary infractions. Data analysis and findings occur 
quarterly and individual professional learning will be given based on 
the needs of teachers and students.

Part 5 – Progress Monitoring  

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
A Mid-year Review of Advance components will be conducted by December 21, 2018 to measure progress of 
components 2B (Creating an Environment of Respect and Rapport) and 2D (Managing Student Behavior) designed to 
both support and challenge students. Approximately 50% of all observations for the 2018-2019 School year will be 
scheduled and conducted by December 21, 2018. Administrators will analyze the data by whole school based on 
components 2B and 2D during a Mid-year Assessment to understand possible root causes and barriers to achieving 
our annual goal. Professional learning will be conducted to meet the needs of individual teachers and students. 

Teachers will self-assess their growth in components 2b and 2d after each observation conducted, and select 
Professional Learning to enhance their training. We have also adopted the program, Safe Public Spaces, which aims to 
establish a safe and supportive school environment by training all members of our school’s staff to promote positive 
student behaviors and interactions, and prevent, understand, and respond to disciplinary infractions. A Safe Public 
Spaces School trainer will come in monthly to collect data and run professional development for our staff on Positive 
School Culture based on her findings.

Tenet 6 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
6.2  The school leader ensures that regular communication with students and families fosters their 

high expectations for student academic achievement.  

6.3  The school engages in effective planning and reciprocal communication with family and 
community stakeholders so that student strength and needs are identified and used to 
augment learning. 

6.4  The school community partners with families and community agencies to promote and provide 
training across all areas (academic and social and emotional developmental health) to support 
student success. 

6.5  The school shares data in a way that promotes dialogue among parents, students, and school

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

After careful review of our attendance (92%) and student achievement (49% of students met state standards in ELA and 
39% for Math), a focus is needed on moving students to the next level. To achieve this goal, a greater emphasis on 
parent involvement and facilitated conversations across content area teachers on specific student progress and 
academic and personal behaviors is warranted. The school will target long term ENL's and SWD's and economically 
disadvantaged with a lens on improving student progress in ELA and Math as well as providing behavioral support to 
students throughout the school day.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program.

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. I.S. 27, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

I.S. 27 will support parents and families of Title I students by:

2. 
3. 
4. 
High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 
the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  
1. 

Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 
workshops and conferences.  

Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 
community needs.

The goal of the Title III direct instruction supplemental program will be to provide students from 
the subgroups with opportunities to grow academically, particularly with respect to English 
Language acquisition in all four modalities: speaking, listening, reading, and writing.  In 
particular, this program will help the ELL subgroups to move up at least one proficiency level or 
score commanding on the Spring 2019 NYSESLAT as well as one level on NYS ELA exam. 
The supplemental program will target students that have scored Transitioning, Expanding and 
first year Commanding on the Spring 2018 NYSESLAT exam. 95% of the students that are 
targeted performed lower on the reading(multiple choice section) and writing section of the 
NYSESLAT.  The direct instruction of this program will target reading comprehension skills and 
and content area writing skills. Both Cohorts will focus on the following reading comprehension 
skills: monitoring comprehension, meta-cognition, answering/asking questions, recognizing text 
structure, identifying content vocabulary, and summarizing.  The program will focus on teaching 
the following writing skills: incorporating content vocabulary, reviewing writing for errors, and 
students being able to assess their own work.  Teachers will model skills, provide students with 
guided practice and opportunities to apply strategies and skills. 
Before school and Saturday program will be offered to our ELL population on Tuesdays and 
Wednesdays from 6:30am till 7:30am and Saturdays from 8:00am-11:00am in order to provide 
our students with multiple opportunities to receive additional services thereby furthering their 
success.  There will be two cohorts of ELLs from grades 6th - 8th participating in the Before 
School Program and Saturday Academy.   
The first cohort will focus on 7th and 8th grade Long-Term ELLs and first year Commanding 
ELLs that scored level ones or twos on the 2018 NYS ELA exam. Students will utilize the C.S.I. 
Literacy program designed to strengthen their reading comprehension skills across the content 
areas, while incorporating writing skills. Students will also read articles practicing their close 
reading of non-fiction texts and focus on strategies to answer multiple choice questions. The 
program will also have students complete a narrative, argumentative and informative writing 
piece implementing the writing strategies that were acquired during the program. The 
culminating event for the program will invite students' parents in for students to share their 
writing pieces and explain how they assessed their selves. 
This program will help ensure that our ELLS will perform better on the NYS ELA, NYS Math 
and Science exams.  Students will be provided with bilingual science glossaries and bilingual 
dictionaries in their native languages.  
The second cohort will be a supplemental Saturday Academy, which will run for 3 hours every 
Saturday morning from December 2017 through April 2018.   This program will run for 
approximately 16 weeks.  The direct instruction of this program will focus on providing students 
with strategies such as: close reading strategies, monitoring comprehension, answering/asking

question, recognizing text structure and breaking down the question to help support students 
while answering multiple choice questions. Teachers will model strategies, provided guided 
practice and students the opportunity to apply their skills. 
There will be three one-hour blocks for each subject (ESL.ELA, and Math).  Sixth graders will 
begin with an ESL/ELA block, and then move to Math.  The seventh grade schedule will be 
Math, then ESL/ELA. The eighth grade schedule will follow ESL/ELA then Math.  There will be 
three content certified teachers including an ELA and Math licensed teacher and a certified ESL 
teacher.  The main focus of the Saturday Academy will be to further develop academic reading 
comprehension and applying strategies to answer multiple choice questions in the ESL/ELA 
portion. The math portion will focus on mathematical concepts and the students' understanding 
of them and computation skills, while focusing on strategies to answer multiple choice 
questions.  Teachers will be using a combination of content area articles from websites such as 
NewsELA, and Readworks, published materials aligned with the Common Core Learning 
Standards and  Attanasio & Associated NYSESLAT test preparation books. 
During the ESL/ELA portion students will be provided grade leveled content area articles with 
their paired multiple choice questions and  New York State exam samples with their paired 
multiple choice questions to apply their strategies. In the math portion students will be provided 
with word problems and New York State exam samples. Students will assess their performance 
on the multiple choice question and identify the strategies they used. Students will maintain a 
portfolio of their questions. At the culmination of the program students will review their 
portfolio, assess their overall performance and identify which strategies that they applied helped 
them to be more successful. 
There will also be a program available for Newcomer ELLs. The program will invite the 
Newcomer ELLs and their parents to come in on Saturday to welcome and help transition them 
into their school community. Parents and Students will be using  social studies based readers 
theatre program that helps students and parents build language while learning about American 
History. This program will help support students with their reading comprehension skills to be 
successful in all content area classes while  supporting parents to understand the tasks that their 
children will be asked to complete in their classes. At the culmination of this program teacher 
will provide parents and students with a completion certificate and celebration. 
Bilingual glossaries, dictionaries, i-pads will be utilized to help students in their native 
languages in Title III classes.    
Invitations and permission slips will be translated into parents preferred languages.  Students 
attendance will be maintained by teachers instructing the program. Mr. Barone will keep all 
attendance on file and enter into an excel spreadsheet.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
1.  The formative assessments that are being used to guide instructional planning for the ELLs are: Degree of Reading Power 
Exams- are given periodically throughout the school year to assess students reading levels providing teachers of ELLs with 
quantitative data such as the students' current reading level and the gains that they make.Fountas and Pinnell Running 
Records- currently being piloted in the 6th and 7th grade, assessments are given after the DRP to provide teachers with fiction 
and non-fiction reading levels for students to use during independent reading in the class. The Fountas and Pinnell Running 
Records provide the teachers of ELLs qualitative data on the skills that students have mastered and also standards and skills

that students need to continue to work on.System 44 Phonics Intervention- web based program provides periodic assessments 
to determine interventions necessary, used primarily by Entering, Emerging and Transitioning ELLs. System 44 provides 
teachers of ELLs quantitative data on the amount of phonemic sounds the students have mastered and the sounds that the 
students still need to acquire.School wide practice of teacher/student questions: “Where am I going?”, "Where am I now?” 
and “How can I close the gap?”- Questions are posted in all classrooms.My Perspectives Curriculum embedded assessments- 
web based formative assessment that provides staff with specific skills that students will need to be successful on the ELA 
exams and will have acquired in the units of instruction. These assessments provide teacher of  ELLs with quantitative data 
such as the ELA skills and standards that the students have mastered for heir grade level and skills that the students will need 
more work in.Teacher created formative assessments such as graphic organizers, exit slips, and observations, etc these 
assessments usually provided teachers qualitative data based on their lessons of the day. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2. .The structures that are in place to support the effort of the following programs are:Degree of Reading Power Exams (DRP)- 
are given in the beginning, middle, and end of the year, and are taken by students in their ELA class, given by their ELA 
teachers. ELA and ENL meet collaboratively to analyze the data. The data is then disseminate  during the cross curricular 
content meeting. Teachers then reflect o the data and work collaboratively to develop strategies to implement across the 
content areas to ensure all students' growth. All teachers meet monthly to discuss students progress, best practices and 
further strategies.Fountas and Pinnell Running Records- currently being piloted in the 6th and 7th grade, assessments are 
given after the DRP to provide teachers with fiction and non-fiction reading levels for students to use during independent 
reading in the class. A select number of 6th and 7th grade teachers are trained to give running records. After the students 
receive their score on the DRP, then the trained teachers pull them while they are in ELA to complete the running record 
assessments. ELA and ENL assess students reading levels. Fountanas and Pinnell Running Records also assesses students' 
reading level, comprehension, fluency and syntax recognition. ELA and ENL teachers meet weekly to use the qualitative and 
quantitative data to implement within their lesson planning, instructional strategies, and reading strategies taught to the 
students.System 44 Phonics Intervention- web based program provides periodic assessments to determine interventions 
necessary, students would complete in ENL classes. System 44 provides the ENL teacher with quantitave data about how many 
phonemic sounds the individual students have mastered. The program is used with ELL students that have scored Entering, 
Emerging and Transitional proficiency level on the current NYSESLAT. ENL teachers diseminate data to ELA teachers during 
collaborative meetings.My Perspectives Curriculum embedded assessments- A web based formative assessment that provides 
staff with specific skills that students will need to be successful on the ELA exams and will have acquired in the units of 
instruction, given after the completion of current unit, given by ELA and ENL teachers. Data from these assessments are also 
disseminated during the cross curricular content meetings. Teacher reflect on data to work collaboratively to develop 
strategies to implement across the content areas. During monthly meeting content teachers meet to discuss the success of 
strategies and best practices and continue to modify strategies based on students needs. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
3.  
3.  The summative assessments that are being used to identify baseline, progress and area of need are:MOSL exams- these will 
be given in the other content area classes to demonstrate students’ strengths and allow content teachers to target their 
instruction.ELL Periodic Assessments-taken in the beginning, middle and end of the year providing teachers more information 
about what students have learned and target their instruction to score commanding on the NYSESLAT.My Perspectives 
Baseline/Benchmark Exams- curriculum based summative assessments that provides staff with specific skills that students will 
need to be successful on the ELA exams and will have acquired in the units of instruction, given after the completion of current 
unit, given by ELA teachers.GO Math Baseline/Benchmark Exams- curriculum based summative assessments that provides staff 
with specific skills that students will need to be successful  on the NYS math exam and will have acquired in the units of 
instruction, given after the completion of current unit, given by Math teachers.Common Core Aligned Writing Tasks- At the 
end of units ELA, Science and Social Studies have students complete common core aligned writing tasks such as argumentative 
writing, narrative writing, and explanatory writing.Teacher Created Common Core Aligned Performance Tasks- Periodically

students are given math performance tasks. 
 
All content area teachers by grade meet the first Tuesday of the month to diseeminate the data from both the formative and 
sumamtive assessments data and discuss best practices and develop strategies for instruction.  ENL teachers meet with the 
ELA teachers during the content meetings. 
Cross curricular content meetings are by grade held on the third Tuesday of the month  to diseminate formative and 
summative assessments data in the different content areas. Best practices and instructional strategies are also developed to 
implement uniformly across the content areas. 
This year based on the assessment data students have made growth in the area of writing across the content areas, teachers 
will continue to utilize the "RACE" response strategy. However, students have demonstrated weaknesses in multiple choice 
questions, identifying the main idea in multiple choice questions and point of view. Teachers will work across the content 
areas by grade to develop effective learning strategies to help students in these areas across the content areas. Teachers will 
meet by content and grade to discuss the effectiveness and best practices of their strategies. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

4.  
Once summative data has been gathered the structures in place to address interventions are the following:During common 
planning time teachers analyze data and use the information to target their instruction and develop intervention strategies to 
address needs of students.Student may be enrolled in the System 44: Phonics Intervention- web based program provides 
periodic assessments to determine interventions necessary, used primarily by Entering, Emerging and Transitioning ELLs.  The 
web-based program provides students with intensive intervention to help students master the foundational reading and 
phonemic skills to decode words, addressing readers from BR-199 Lexile level.Students may be enrolled in the Read 180: 
Reading Intervention- web based comprehensive system of curriculum and instruction, addressing readers from 200L-1300L 
Lexile level.ELA Classes may incorporate-Strategic Adolescent Reading Intervention- literature-focused, Tier II intervention for 
students in grades 6-9 who are reading 2-4 years below grade level, currently being piloted in the 6th grade. The program is 
designed to enhance students' comprehension of the text and fluency skills.Students may be programmed for additional 
Mathematics and/or ELA enrichment periods. 
 
All content area teachers by grade meet the first Tuesday of the month to diseeminate the data from both the formative and 
sumamtive assessments data and discuss best practices and develop strategies for instruction.  ENL teachers meet with the 
ELA teachers during the content meetings. 
Cross curricular content meetings are by grade held on the thirs Tuesday of the month  to diseminate formative and 
summative assessments data in the different content areas. Best practices and instructional strategies are also developed to 
implement uniformly across the content areas. 
This year based on the assessment data students have made growth in the area of writing across the content areas, teachers 
will continue to utilize the "RACE" response strategy. However, students have demonstrated weaknesses in multiple choice 
questions, identifying the main idea in multiple choice questions and point of view. Teachers will work across the content 
areas by grade to develop effective learning strategies to help students in these areas across the content areas. Teachers will 
meet by content and grade to discuss the effectiveness and best practices of their strategies. 
 
School leadership ensures that the new implementations are being supported and implemented by all content and ENL 
teachers by maintaining attendance sheets and minutes of the collaborative meetings. School leadership also ensures that the 
new implementations are in place during their evaluations. 
. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Although Anning S. Prall does not serve students in grades K-5, our philosophy is heavily data-driven and we are ready for RtI 
initiatives if they were to advance into secondary education. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62 

 

We implement classes for smaller populations of ELLs with IEPs in an effort to give them a "double dose" of instruction in a 
smaller, more intimate setting. We are also working toward even more intimate settings for the minority of students who 
need Tier 3 assistance with their English acquisition.    
ELL designated classes are programmed for periods of reading enrichment and Math AIS because most of our ELLs made 
growth on both the ELA and Math State exams they still demonstrated an area of weakness in answering multiple choice 
questions. 
SETTS teachers push into content area as well as provide pull out services.  ELLs are also invited to attend small group AIS 
classes provided during Saturday Academy and Early Morning Programs. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
   
6.  
  Anning S. Prall uses the data from the following outcome assessments to evaluate our ELLs success and inform and develop 
new ELL programs:NYS ELA Exam- data is used to target instruction and instructional strategies.  Data is also used to develop 
programs for interventions.  Data is also analyzed for strands that were successful to continue strategies and areas that need 
to be developed to implement new strategies.NYS Math Exam- data is used to target instruction and instructional strategies. 
Data is also used to develop programs for interventions. Data is also analyzed for strands that were successful to continue 
strategies and areas that need to be developed to implement new strategies.NYSESLAT Exam:  data is used to identify ELL 
students’ needs and periods of ENL services they need to be programmed for.  Data is analyzed for students’ strengths and 
weaknesses in the four modalities.  They are Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking.NYS Science Performance and Written 
Exam- data is used to target instruction and instructional strategies. Data is also used to develop programs for interventions. 
Data is also analyzed for strands that were successful to continue strategies and areas that need to be developed to 
implement new strategies. 
 
All data is analyzed and disseminated during content grade meeings and during cross curriculur content meetings. ENL 
teachers and content are teachers work closely during these meetings to analyze how the ELLs in their individual classes 
performed on the state exams and how the ELLs performed schoolwide. 
 
Teachers will work collaboratively to develop uniform strategies to implement across the curricular content areas to provide 
students with a uniform strategies to utilize in the different content areas. Teachers  continiue to meet monthly to analyze the 
effectiveness of the strategies, discuss best practices and continue to make adjustments based on the learning and 
instructional gaps based on the all state exams inluding the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL,  formative and summative assessments 
data. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

7.  
The structures in place to disseminate the finding from the outcome assessments to make adjustments to the program are the 
following: 
The data specialist provides data from the NYS Math, NYS ELA, and NYS Science exam to the math coach and content area 
grade leaders.  During the grade content meetings and cross curricular meetings the data analysis is discussed. Teams develop 
intructional strategies to implement to address learning and instuctional gaps. Teams meet monthly in both grade content and 
cross curricular content meetings to collaborative review instructional strategies based on formative and summative 
assesments. Adjustments are made as necessary to the instructional strategies based on the progress or lack of progress 
demontrated on the formative and summative assessments. 
 
During these meeting the data from the NYSESLAT is disseminated in the by the ENL teachers, ENL teachers discuss individual 
students proficiency levels, strengths and weaknesess in each modality. This data is also considered when teachers are 
developing insructional strategies. The NYSESLAT data is also used to design Saturday Academy and Morning Programs. The 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63 

 

 

NYSITELL data is considered for the newcoming students as they enter. 
 
School leadership ensures that all teachers, content and ENL teachers are implementing changes based on the data  on all local 
and state tests during their teacher evaluations. During evaluations school leadership is looking to see a uniformy of strategies 
in the content area and also across the curricular content areas. School leadership also maintains attendance sheets and 
minutes of meetings to ensure teachers are frequently diseminating the analysis of state and current assessments data and 
strategies are being adjusted as necessary. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction is delivered for ELL in the following programs as per CR Part 154.2:Freestanding ENL program: On each 
grade there are designated ELL general education classes, ELL ICT- where the SWD are ELLs,  ELL 12:1, and ELL 12-1-1 
where most or all of the students are ELLs.  In all ELL designated classes students are grouped heterogeneously by 
their proficiency levels. 
To ensure that the ELLs are provided with their integrated minutes as per the CR Part 154.2, ENL teachers push into 
these classes ELA periods four period a week. 
To ensure that all students are provided with their standalone minutes, students that have scored Entering and 
Emerging are programmed for four periods a week with the ENL teacher in their room. ENL students are programmed 
by individual grades to receive their stand-alone minutes. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

  
TBE program- At this time we do not have a TBE program as per our parent choice. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

DL program- At this time we do not have a Dual Language program as per our parent choice. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

       
2. 
      2. To ensure that the students are provided the mandated minutes of instructional time according to proficiency in each 
program model, students are programmed as follows:A. Freestanding ENL program: On each grade there are designated ELL 
general education classes, ELL ICT- where the SWD are ELLs, and ELL 12:1- where most or all of the students are ELLs.  All ELL 
designated students are grouped heterogeneously by their proficiency levels from Entering to Second Year Commanding.  ENL 
teachers integrate into four periods of ELA. To ensure that students receive their standalone ENL minute, 6th graders are 
programmed into the 6th Grade ENL standalone periods, and, the 7th Grade standalone minutes and 8th graders are 
programmed into the 8th grade standalone minutes.  ENL standalone minutes are provided during students encores to ensure 
they are not missing content area instruction.

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  
3. 
Anning S Prall only has a freestanding ENL program. Content area classes are instructed in English only using ESL 
methodologies while teaching their common core aligned curriculum. Content area teachers are trained in ESL methodology 
strategies and are supported by ENL certified teachers. Instruction of ELLs in the content area classes will be aided by the 
presence of an ENL teacher, who will be "pushing in" to further, scaffold and support instruction of ELLs in the content areas. 
Instruction is also aided with strategies like a “buddy system”, where students with higher English proficiency levels are paired 
with students of lower proficiency levels to aid them with their learning. There is also native language support, such as 
textbooks in their native language (if available), bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, and bilingual libraries and reference 
books, to support ELL students. Much is done to pair students of similar native languages together, but when this is not 
possible, students are encouraged to stay after classes and attend tutoring.        All content area classes, like the English 
classes, are conducted strictly in English. Aids like Smart boards, IPads, and reference tables, etc., are also delivered in English. 
Students are encouraged to seek native language help and teachers are provided with websites and other translation services 
to assist students who do not have native language “buddies” or who are in danger of falling behind. Some of the curriculum 
utilized has translated versions such as My Perspectives and Go Math which have a Spanish component. New strategies have 
also been put into place by the ENL teachers. These include, but are not limited to, incorporating content area material into 
ESL instruction and using content areas to facilitate the learning of English. The ENL teachers use grade-level material and 
scaffold it with content area material for additional support. This allows the students to be exposed to content area material in 
more than one class, with more than one teacher. The exposure and delivery of this material in different contexts is 
considered vital for content acquisition, and Anning S. Prall will be looking at student performance closely to determine the 
success of these strategies.    
      ELLs will meet the demands of the NYS Learning Standards because ENL and content area teacher will utilize and scaffold 
they CCLS NYS Standard aligned contents curriculum as necessary for their students. Additional materials maybe utilized to

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

4. To ensure that students are evaluated in their home language throughout the year:Content Classroom Assessments- if the 
assessment is available in the students home language then they are provided with it. If it is not available then the students 
are provided the assessment in English and encouraged to use bilingual dictionaries and glossaries.State Exams- if the exam is 
available in their home language then it is ordered for the student, they are also provided with bilingual glossaries when taking 
the exam.Evaluations for PPT/Special Education- we have a bilingual psychologist who conducts the evaluation if the student’s 
native language is Spanish. If the student’s home language is not Spanish then a translator is brought in to complete the 
evaluation.

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

5. 
Anning S. Prall differentiates the instruction for the following subgroups:a.            SIFE:  SIFE students are identified beginning 
at the Home Language Survey when the parent indicates their maybe a gap in the students prior schooling. If the student may 
have an interupted education and scores Entering or EMerging on the NYSITELL the the ENL teacher will begin the SIFE 
Identification Process by administering the  NYSED Oral Interview Questionaire, the NYSED Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener 
and the Writing Screener. If the students is then identified as a SIFE student they are entered into the ats screen BNDC as a 
SIFE. 
 
ENL teachers differentiate for SIFE student by integrating into students' ELA content classes and provide students small group 
standalone, Pearson’s newcomer curriculum, and MY Perspective’s translated version of textbook when available. Go Math 
also has translated version available. Content area teachers are taught some of the following, but are not limited to, strategies 
such as incorporating visuals and providing sentence starters. SIFE students also use the phonemic developing program System 
44 during their ENL standalone periods, to help develop basic phonemic skills in English to help them decode words. 
SIFE Students are also programmed for ELA and Math enrichment classes. 
SIFE students are invited to attend “Breakfast for Beginners” which is a morning program that is for SIFE and New coming 
students.b.            Newcomers: students are provided language buddies as soon as they enter in our school, if possible. The are 
provided with bilingual glossaries, small group instruction, Pearson’s newcomer curriculum, and MY Perspective’s translated 
version of textbook when available. Go Math also has translated version available. Students receive integrated Content area 
ENL support along with standalone ENL classes where the ENL teachers continue to reinforce content area support. . Content 
area teachers are taught some of the following, but are not limited to, strategies such as incorporating visuals and providing 
sentence starters. Newcomers students also use the phonemic developing program System 44 during their ENL standalone 
periods, to help develop basic phonemic skills in English to help them decode words. Newcomers students are invited to 
attend “Breakfast for Beginners” which is a morning program that is for SIFE and New coming students.c.             Developing: 
Students are provided bilingual glossaries, translated text if necessary, Saturday and after school supplemental services. 
Developing students also utilize the reading comprehension Read 180 program if they are programmed for ENL standalone 
periods. Students are also invited to attend a morning program that targets Developing and Longterm ELLs that focuses on 
reading comprehension skills, essay writing, NYS test prep and NYSESLAT prep, content area class support. They are 
programmed for additional remedial periods of content area needs.d.            Long term ELLs: Students are provided with 
content area class support and Saturday and after school supplemental services. Long term ELLs students also utilize the 
reading comprehension Read 180 program if they are programmed for ENL standalone periods. Students are also invited to 
attend a morning program that targets developing and Long term ELLs that focuses on reading comprehension skills, essay 
writing, NYS test prep and NYSESLAT prep. They are programmed for additional remedial periods of content area needs.

Former ELLs also continue to receive differentiation of instruction for up to two years after Exiting the ELL status by being 
provided two periods of integrated ENL services. Former ELLs are still provided bilingual glossaries, native language texts and 
state exams as available and ELL testing accomadations as necessary. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 6.         
Teachers of ELL-SWDs use the same grade level content curriculum that they scaffold to their individual student’s needs. The 
My Perspectives ELA common core aligned curriculum has an ELL adapted workbook.  The teaching guide also provides 
teachers with suggestions on how to scaffold lessons for both ELLs and SWDs. They will also receive support from ENL teacher 
pushing into content area subjects for a minimum of 180 minutes to assist access to academic content and accelerate English 
language development. All instruction is conducted in English but ELL-SWDs are also provided with bilingual glossaries and 
translated versions when requested by individual student.   
The Go Math common core aligned curriculum textbook is availabe in Spanish. The teaching guide also provides teachers with 
suggestions on hoe to scaffold their lessons for both ELLS and SWDs. Math teachers receive support, best practices and 
strategies from the ENL teachers in the cross curicular content meetings held the third Monday of the month. All instruction is 
conducted in English but the ELL-SWDs are also provdide with bilingual glossaries.           
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
7. For all ELL-SWD students the IEP is reviewed at the beginning of the year to determine LAP for each child. ELL teachers are 
also attending IEP conferences for each ELL-SWD. ESL strategies are infused into content instruction using comprehensive 
strategies including directed reading-thinking approach (preview, predict, read, review, summarize); brainstorming, organizing, 
drafting, reviewing, getting feedback, revising, editing, proofreading, and publishing), teacher read-alouds, focused strategies 
including graphic organizers, think alouds, think-pair-share and modeling.  Language structures including mini lessons of 
grammar in connection with the content lesson, academic vocabulary including content-related vocabulary in each lesson, 
semantic webs, personal word banks and scaffolding on an ongoing basis. Instruction is differentiated, scaffolded for ELL 
subgroups using the following methods to help teachers support the learning of ELL students in the mathematics, social studies 
and science classes: usage of visuals and manipulates to illustrate and import ideas, usage of visual cueing, color coding and 
graphic organizers used as a way of focusing attention, sequencing steps, increasing ability to recall information, minimize the 
number of problems assigned and the amount of copying required, usage of tactile cues, capitalize on problems to promote 
understanding, sample problems and charts available, use of sequencing instruction in small steps with adequate provision for 
practice and review. Academic language development is planned in a variety of ways. The Common Core approach is employed 
in all language arts classes, as well as, other content area classes. Word work, which includes vocabulary, grammar, spelling, 
and usage is incorporated into double blocks to address the needs demonstrated by students through ongoing assessment of 
both oral and written work. The ELL teachers push into classes with ELL students, working with the general education teacher 
to address the particular needs of this population. They work with the target population to enhance their understanding of 
reading passages and to assist the development of written language conventions. Special attention is given to basic language 
skills for these students, such as phonemic awareness, conventions for word endings such as plurals, tenses and comparisons, 
idioms, sentence structure parts of speech and dictionary skills. Students are given time during the regular class block to work 
on supplementary materials that focus on these skills. Morning programs and Saturday academies are designed to provide 
support to all of our ELL students. Scheduling is based on flexible grouping, ensuring that our ELL-SWDs spend time with their 
non-disabled peers. We also have 3 ICT classes where ELL-SWDs are flexibly grouped with non-disabled peers during all subject 
area instruction. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered.

 Language structures including mini lessons of grammar in connection with the content lesson, academic vocabulary including 
content-related vocabulary in each lesson, semantic webs, personal word banks and scaffolding, are provided on an ongoing 
basis. 
 Instruction is differentiated for all of the ELL subgroups but especially the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding 
level students using the following methods to help teachers support the learning of ELL students in the mathematics, social 
studies and science classes: usage of visuals and manipulatives to illustrate and import ideas, usage of visual cueing, color 
coding and graphic organizers used as a way of focusing attention, sequencing steps, increasing ability to recall information, 
minimize the number of problems assigned and the amount of copying required, usage of tactile cues, capitalize on problems 
to promote understanding, sample problems and charts available, use of sequencing instruction in small steps with adequate

The Common Core model is employed in all language arts classes as well as other content area classes. Word work, which 
includes vocabulary, grammar, spelling, and usage, is incorporated into double blocks to address the needs demonstrated by 
students through ongoing assessment of both oral and written work. The ELL teachers push into classes with ELL students, 
working with the regular classroom teacher to address the particular needs of this population. 
Teachers collaborate during common planning during grade content and cross curicular meerings in order to address the 
increasing need for best ESL methodology and strategies to implements uniformly schoolwide based on the state, formative 
and summative assessments. They work with the target population to enhance their understanding of reading passages and to 
assist the development of written language conventions. 
 Special attention is given to basic language skills for these students the enterin, emerging, and transitioning level students, 
such as phonemic awareness, conventions for word endings such as plurals, tenses and comparisons, idioms, sentence 
structure parts of speech and dictionary skills. Students are given time during the regular class block to work on supplementary 
materials that focus on these skills. In addition, all beginner and lower intermediate students are given dictionaries to work 
with at home as well as in school. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

9.  
Anning S. Prall is looking to expand supplemental services for Saturday classes that will focus on college and career readiness in 
line with the Common Core State Standards. 
  The program has also improved by adding another ENL teacher to support teachers in content areas. 
We will also be piloting  another reading comprehension program,CSI Literacy. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

10. Anning S Prall does not currently have a bilingual program as per our parent choice. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
11. 
Throughout the school year, ELL students are informed that they are open to participate in all school organizations offered at 
Anning S Prall. 
Letters of invitation are provided to ELLs in classrooms to be backpacked home or mailed. 
ELL Students will have more opportunities to enroll in supplemental services because it will be offered in the morning before 
school and on Saturdays.  ELL students will be provided more encore classes because of the push-in model. 
 ELL students will have more opportunities to participate in more art, Lego-robotics, journalism, foreign language, chorus, 
drama and band.Aside from supplemental services after school, ELLs are invited to participate in the Sports and Arts program 
available after school. Students are provided applications and instructed to return to their second period teachers.

School leadership ensures that ELLs ae particpating in the supplemental programs by inviting them and reviewing attendance 
lists. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
12.  
Content and ENL teachers use SMART boards consistently to aid with instruction. The SMART boards also allow for translations 
to occur due to internet access in the classroom which will be provided for all ELL subgroups.System 44 Phonics Intervention- 
web based program provides periodic assessments to determine interventions necessary, used primarily by Entering, Emerging 
and Transitioning ELLs.My Perspectives Curriculum embedded assessments- A web based formative assessment that provides 
staff with specific skills that students will need to be successful on the ELA exams and will have acquired in the units of 
instruction, given after the completion of current unit, given by ELA teachers provided for all ELL subgroups. 
CSI Literacy will be piloted this year in the standalone periods for Entering, Emerging, Transitioning and Exapnding 
ELLs. Content area teachers also use various website and videos such as, but are not limited to, NEWSELA, Brain-pop, Discovery 
Education, etc. to support their lessons and provide ELLs with visual support necessary to gain academic language. 
Most teachers of ELLs either have access to iPads or Laptops for students to utilize google translate for all ELL subgroups. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

13.  Anning S. Prall only has a Freestanding ENL program so all instruction is conducted in English.  Home language is supported 
by providing translated versions of textbooks, bilingual glossaries and picture dictionaries. The ENL classrooms have books 
available in student’s native languages. The school library has a section of native language books of the current best sellers 
that students have access to visit during their lunch periods. Students also have access to computers that they can utilize to 
translate documents as they want. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

14. All required services, support, and resources correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels. Guidance is provided by 
counselors. All libraries are leveled to students' age, grade, interest, reading levels.  The ELA My Persepctives Curriculum and 
the Math Curriculum Go Math are Common Core aligned with standards and are age and grade appropriate. The teacher 
manuals for these curricula provide teacher with suggestions to scaffold for ELLs.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
15. At this time Anning S. Prall is not sharing our building. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
16. Anning S Prall welcomes all newly enrolled ELL students at the beginning of the school year or during the school year.  ENL 
teachers greet the students in the main office and students are provided with a language buddy. The ENL teachers will provide 
them with a tour of the school and introduces a language buddy from their designated homeroom who will assist them.  ENL 
teacher introduces them to Administrators, content classroom teachers, as well as, fellow classmates. 
Anning S. Prall holds its Student Assemblies to help familiarize students will rules and procedures that the language buddy will 
translate to the new student. There are two open houses that are provided for ELLs. Students are invited to attend “Breakfast 
for Beginners” which is a morning program that is for SIFE and New coming students introducing students to school routines, 
curriculum and assessments. 
One evening Anning S. Prall has high school night, where 7-8th grade ELLs and their parents are provided with information 
about high schools they may want to apply to.  Incoming 6th grade ELLs can attend our middle school tour, where their parent 
and student can tour Anning S. Prall. They are provided with information about the different programs available and get to 
meet their ESL teachers.

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

18. At this current time Anning S. Prall does not have a dual language program, as per our parent choices. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
           
 Professional Development and Support for School Staff1.  Every Monday during the time allotted by the NYCDOE our entire 
staff will be taking part in professional learning sessions. The weekly meetings include Grade Content Impact Team and 
Danielson Lesson Planning Study.  At the end of the study groups the team will compile a collection of ENL and SWD strategies 
that can be used in content area classes by monolingual teachers in order to scaffold instruction for ELL students within their 
classes. In addition, our two ESL certified teachers will be solicited to provide staff development to ELL teachers or to 
mainstream teachers with ELLs.  In addition, teachers are allotted time on Mondays to collaborate as a department (by grade), 
using Google Drive to share power point presentations and lesson plans. This is where the ELA teachers are given time to 
collaboratively plan with their ENL teachers. It gives teachers of each department time to discuss their plans and make sure 
they are all on the same page, and are covering the same curriculum topics. 
Also, every Tuesday afternoon, after parent engagement, there is either a Collaborative Teacher Team  meeting, grade 
meeting or department/inquiry meeting for all teachers. This gives all content area teachers and teams time to collaborate on 
the Instructional Focus for the marking period. This time also gives the ENL teachers time to get feedback and give support to 
those teachers of ELLs that do not normally plan with the ENL teachers and do not get 
their push in services. 
 
       
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
2..Anning S. Prall will meet the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2 during our Monday learning 
sessions. 15% of the learning sessions that will be addressed to the entire staff will receive ELL-specific professional 
development. ENL teachers will receive 50% of their training in ELL-specific professional development from Borough Field 
Network Supports and Department of ELL's.   Attendance of these learning sessions will be recorded by sign in sheet and 
maintained. An up to date matrix of scheduled professional learning sessions will be maintained by administration.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parental Involvement1. Anning S Prall will provide annual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, 
language development progress, language proficiency assessment results, language development needs in all content areas in 
the parent preferred language through staff translation or the unit of Translation and Interpretation during the allotted parent 
contact time on Tuesdays and other meetings alotted for parent contact.    
 We involve parents in the Literacy (and ENL pull-out) curriculum by sending home bilingual letters to parents of ELLs informing 
them of the content and theme of a new unit the class is currently working on, as well as suggestions on how they can help 
their child in the areas of reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Parents are also given their child’s ENL progress report, 
which was specifically created to address all four language modalities. This is a great time to discuss their child’s progress and 
address any concerns. These progress reports will go out 4 times a year (with report cards) and discussed at all Parent-teacher 
conferences. Parents are notified that they can arrange a meeting with the ENL teacher at any time to discuss the progress 
report if it is not completely understood. These progress reports are in the process of getting translated. Any goals that 
students create in ENL class must be signed by the parent. In addition to notices, the ENL teachers use the Translation and 
Interpretation Unit phone line, provided by the NYCDOE, to contact the parents of their ELL students to hold phone 
meetings/conferences as well if the parents work schedule is not accommodating. Phone calls are made to notify parents of 
their child's progress as well as any other concerns. Teachers are allotted time on Tuesday afternoons to contact (via phone, e-
mail, or PupilPath) or meet with parents. 
During our welcoming curriculum night parents are given their Pupil Path information and are encouraged to use it daily and as 
a preferred method of contact with teachers. It is also a great way for parents to be an active participant in their child’s 
education, especially since HW assignments for many classes are posted on Pupil Path and their attendance and grades can be 
monitored daily, so parents do not have to wait until parent teacher conferences to find out how their child is doing. Pupil Path 
is able to be accessed in multiple languages. Bilingual paraprofessionals are in attendance for the PTCs to assist in translating. 
Letters are sent home (in parent’s preferred language) so they can pick from an option of dates and times (on Tuesday 
afternoons) to meet with the ENL teachers to discuss their child’s progress and any concerns the teacher or parent may have. If 
a parent does not return the form, then the ENL teachers will reach out to the parent via phone and pupil path to set up a time 
for the annual meeting to take place. During these meetings parents are given their child’s NYSESLAT scores, as well as their 
lexile scores so they can help their children pick out appropriate books and be aware of where there child is currently at, and 
what can be done at home to help them progress. Cathy Mayo, our Parent Coordinator is available to help our parents, 
especially those of ELLs with any questions pertaining to the health requirements needed to attend any New York City public 
school. She helps to distribute information with regard to health 2015-16 SCEP-FL 88 insurance, as well as the availability of 
preventative health clinics in our area. Our Parent Coordinator can also help parents if translation services are needed such as 
for parent conferences or IEP meetings. This can be done through three way phone calls with a member of the translation unit, 
or by arranging for a translation unit member to visit the school.  
Another activity to increase parental involvement is "Family Fun Night" which is extended to our ELLs and SWD population. 
Family Fun Night gives the staff an opportunity to meet with parents in an informal setting. This also gives the parents an 
opportunity to meet with teachers and participate in actiivities and socialize with one another. Family Fun Night occurs four 
times throughout the year, depending on funding., this incorporates a different theme for each event including food, crafts, 
sports activities and videos. Teachers and parents can communicate. 
       

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

2. . The school has an active PTA organization which reaches out to all parents including the parents of the ELLs. Parents are 
encouraged to attend PTA meetings, become involved in all school activities, and be involved in the education of their children. 
Teachers are in constant contact with parents, with or without translation, to make sure parents are aware of the issues facing 
their children and to assist them if their children are having any problems of any kind. Parents come to school regularly, 
including open school conference time, to meet with the teacher in person to discuss their child's education. Parent Teacher 
Conferences are held four times per year and parents are strongly encouraged to attend as this is when they can receive their 
child's report card. All activities are sent out in Spanish (and other languages, as necessary) and translators are available. 
Parents are asked to complete a survey to indicate areas of need. The Parent Survey is reviewed by the leadership and inquiry 
teams to determine areas of need that can be addressed by changes in the CEP or by scheduling workshops. The Parent

Coordinator does outreach to parents who have students in need of SES services. Assistance is given to complete these 
applications.Our population consists of students representing cultural and language diversity including our top language 
groups (Spanish, Arabic, and Urdu). It is recognized that within and among these language groups there are cultural 
differences, which will be reflected in the school environment. Parents are aware of the school's high expectations about non-
discrimination against any culture or any religion. In consideration for student success, it is important that a school and home 
relationship be heightened. Parents must be made aware of the importance of explicit socialization of students to the cultural 
expectations of the classroom, for example, interaction with other students, classroom behaviors, group work, whole class 
discussions; et cetera. It is in this regard that we continuously strengthen our parent edification through various workshops 
using the native language through in-house consultants. In addition, conversations and communication about student 
performance will be ongoing throughout the school year. In doing so, we increase the parents’ understanding of academic 
standards, assessments and tests. Also, translation services are utilized as a means of communicating information about the 
school’s various academic programs and students’ participation to ELL parents. These activities are in part but are not 
restricted to the use of in-person interpretation and for translation of appropriate school documents not available from the 
central board.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Matthew Barone, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

1.  The data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both 

written and oral communication are Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey, the home 
language ATS report (RAPL and RCPL) and student emergency cards. Parents’ requests are also noted and 
updated when necessary. The Language Access Coordinator will maintain a report listing the languages 
that parents speak by class and grade that can be updated accordingly.
