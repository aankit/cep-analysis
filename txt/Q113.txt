Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The 113 community is committed to developing independent life-long leaders. Our students will become goal-
oriented innovators who will inspire a positive change in the world. 

PS/IS 113 will unlock student potential by engaging students in both independent and collaborative problem-solving 
activities, challenging students to become critical thinkers and providing students with leadership opportunities that 
build character and foster growth. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Our instructional focus is to increase academic rigor and raise the level of student autonomy and accountability 
through teacher collaboration and development to further enhance and align academics and instruction. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Located in Glendale, a predominantly residential section of Queens, NY, PS/IS 113 has a student population of 888 
(5% Asian, 1% Black, 42% Hispanic, 51% White, 1% other). 6% of our students are ELLs and 15% have an IEP. Above 
average student attendance and teacher attendance help create a stable environment for education. A high level of 
parent involvement results in a strong collaborative partnership between home and school creating an enhanced 
educational culture. We have partnered with community based organizations (Greater Ridgewood Youth Council, 
Kiwanis) and developed programs to increase student engagement while decreasing student disciplinary infractions 
(CHAMPS, SONYC, CASA, Beautiful Me, Student Council). Our school population (staff, students, families) participates 
in many endeavors to strengthen and develop community ties, such as food drives, collecting for UNICEF, Toys for 
Tots, Crayola Marker Recycling Drive, Career Day and , Ronald McDonald Can Tab Drive, and Stop & Shop Reward 

Our academic achievement is an important part of our mission. We are meeting our targets and have exceeded the 
state, city and district averages for NYS state tests in ELA and Math for 2018. According to the most recent survey, 
there is a high level of satisfaction from parents, teachers and students with our school culture, instructional core and 
systems for improvement. 

While we are very proud of our school, we do recognize that there is always a need for growth and improvement. A 
key area of focus for us this year is student performance in Math. While we are meeting targets, Math proficiency is 
slightly above 59%. One of our goals is to increase student performance levels in problem solving which will impact 
overall math proficiency. Another area of focus will be increasing and strengthening parent involvement in the school. 
We have a high level of parent involvement in many areas and a strong home school partnership, but data indicates 
we need to involve more parents in participating in more school activities. We need to focus on increased parent 
volunteerism. 

We will work towards increasing the collaboration between home, school and community. Our teachers will continue 
to develop relationships to increase our shared understanding of highly effective instructional practices. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

One of our special student populations is our emotionally distressed students who exhibit self harming behaviors. To 
address these concerns, our plans have been to focus on the targeted and universal populations. To address the 
targeted population, our School Counselor has implemented ‘at-risk’ counseling in school as well as providing the 
family and student with listings of local outside counseling agencies and Department of Education resources. To 
address the universal population, our Mental Health counselor provided by Thrive NYC, has conducted several 
classroom lessons and parent workshops related to this topic.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The element of Trust was an area of significant improvement with a score of 4.58. This year we will look to make gains 
in the area of collaborative teachers, where the current score is 3.93.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
A review of data (NYS exam) indicates that we are meeting our targets and our level of growth is well above NYC and 
NYS results. However, close to 40% of our students are still not reaching proficiency. After a review of our June 2018 
Instructional Reports and 2018 Item Skills Analysis, teacher teams determined problem solving was a critical area for 
growth in mathematics. This area of focus will also continue to foster student growth in ELA. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019 all students, including ELLs and SWDs, will improve proficiency in math by 5% as measured by I-ready in 
grades 3-8 and performance task results in K-2.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
According to our Learning Environment Survey, students feel both safe and academically challenged. Our overall 
Supportive Environment Framework score was 4.16. However, a review of our attendance indicates that there is a 
decrease in student motivation once they enter middle school. The number of students with 90+% attendance 
decreased 2% to 88%. By implementing The Leader in Me program, students will be immersed in the 7 habits. The 
teachings of this program will foster a sense of pride, leadership, responsibility and empathy within all students, 
which will transfer over into seeing an overall decrease in latenesses, absences, and OORS incidents. Additionally, 
students will have an integral voice in the way their classrooms and the school are run, leading to a greater sense of 
ownership and therefore, students will have a greater intrinsic motivation to excel.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of all pedagogical staff and students will have participated in Phase 3 of the Leader in Me 
program. The effectiveness of this program will be evidenced by an increase in the core passing rate to 96.7 % and a 
1% increase in the number of students with 90+% attendance.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our Learning Environment Survey demonstrated 97% positive responses to questions focused on teacher 
collaboration. However, our Framework Score for Collaborative Teachers is weighed down to 3.93 due to a proficient 
rating in Quality Review indicator 4.2. 67% of our teachers were rated HE, allowing for reduced observations and 
requiring intervisitations as part of professional practice. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 85% of teachers will participate in at least 4 rounds of collaborative intervisitations to share best 
practices, communicate actionable feedback and develop collegial relationships among pedagogues, resulting in a 0.10 
overall rating increase for teachers rated in Advance.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our Framework Score for Effective School Leadership exceeded our target with a 4.29 rating. However, a review of 
our Advance component rating averages indicates that component 3d was our lowest rated component (3.17).  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, teachers will achieve an average increase of 0.10 in Danielson's FFT component 3d as measured by final 
ratings in Advance.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our Framework Score for Strong Family and Community Ties exceed the target with a score of 4.23. Our Learning 
Environment Survey results indicated a 94% positive response rate for questions related to this element. However, 
question 4a on parent volunteerism only had a 71% positive response rate. 

A review of data (NYS ELA and Math exams, School Quality Review) indicates that we are meeting our targets and our 
level of growth exceeds the results for NYC and NYS. However, close to 50% of students are not reaching proficiency. 
To improve student progress, we need to create a strong home to school connection. A strengthening of school, home 
and community ties can result in improving student academic progress. We have a strong parent-school partnership 
and we will continue to provide opportunities for parent volunteerism to encourage more parents to participate in 
school programs and activities. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, there will be a 10% increase in the number of parent/guardians that have participated and volunteered at 
school events as measured by parent surveys.

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S./I.S. 113Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS/IS 113Q will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
The goal of our Title III program is to provide supplemental academic support for our English 
Language Learners in 1-8th grade based on the 2018 NYSESLAT and 2018 ELA and Math state 
exam. This program will be conducted with a Saturday Academy (with one ENL teacher) for 
Grades 7-8 ELLs and an After school program(with three ENL teachers) for grades 1-2 and 3-
5 for ELLs. These groups were chosen based on the number of ELLs and entering/emerging 
ELLs in each grade as well as looking at ELA and Math assessments to see which ELLs will 
benefit from supplementary language support. All four language modalities of the NYSESLAT 
scores are analyzed and guides the instruction. Classes will be taught in English with bilingual 
resources available and will be scaffolded for entering, emerging, transitioning and expanding 
levels for both programs. Due to the small population of ELLs at PS/IS 113  and the range of 
grade levels/language proficiencies, the ENL teachers in both programs will use multiple entry 
points scaffolds to meet the needs of all students in the program. The After School program will 
begin in September 2018 and go through Spring 2019. The Saturday Academy will begin in the 
winter and coincide with another Saturday Academy running at the same times and dates. The 
Saturday academy will have an average of 15 students and the after school program will have an 
average of 20 students. The Saturday academy will focus on academic language and fluency, as 
well as ELA and math skills through guided reading, sentence structure and language scaffolds 
through ELA/Math content areas taught by a certified ENL teacher. In the after school program 
we will focus on ELA and content area skills. Both classes will be instructed by  dually certified 
ENL/common branch teachers. All subject areas will be taught with close reading instruction and 
guided reading in all content areas. The Saturday academy will take place on 6 Saturdays 
throughout the school year from 9am-12pm. The after school program will take place on 
Thursdays after school from 2:20pm-3:50pm. Instructional materials will be purchased to 
support social studies and science in content areas. Some vendors we are using are: Scholastic 
informational texts, Lexia Language learning computer program, Benchmark Education 
Explorers text sets to provide access to while developing literacy and language, Attanasio & 
Associates Language proficiency tool kits, Leveled Non-Fiction Libraries that promote literacy 
in entering and emerging ELLs.  Some materials and strategies that will be used are teacher 
made lessons using interactive read-alouds, Thinking Maps, Guided Reading, sentence 
Deconstruction/Reconstruction and word play keeping in mind BICS and CALP. Teachers will 
also facilitate students' acquisition of English by immersing them in interactive and "Juicy word" 
Read Alouds for vocabulary work and higher order thinking. Teachers will incorporate high 
order thinking with response to literature activities aligned to grade standards, and by engaging 
in needs-based interactive SmartBoard/Promethean Board lessons and games to enhance their 
knowledge and facility with English vocabulary and grammar. Lexia Core 5 and Lexia Strategies 
will be provided to ELL students as a supplemental reading and grammar program to 
allow students to be challenged at their individual reading level and to assess their progress. This 
will be monitored by the ENL teacher throughout the school year. All materials purchased for the 
Title III programs will only be used as supplemental materials, not during the mandated school 
day. Home language support will be provided through the use of technology and bilingual 
texts/glossaries/dictionaries. Students of the same home language will be encouraged to work

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
with each other using both English and their home language. All parents will be notified of the 
available supplementary programs, as well as parent engagement activities through letters sent 
home in both English and the home language using bilingual staff members support as well as 
the Translation and Interpretation unit and Language Line for any phone calls or further 
communication when needed. The Title III Saturday Academy and After School program will 
reach the diverse spectrum of English languages in our school community and will provide 
"above and beyond" scaffolding for ELL students and Former ELL students to improve their 
overall achievement.

Begin description here:            
The teachers working in the After School and Saturday program, as well as the ENL mandated 
provider for grades k-8 and classroom teachers who work with ELLs will meet for Professional 
Development sessions organized by the ELL coordinator Tara Weiss, on Wednesdays from 2:21-
3:21pm (5 months for 1 hour). Teachers will be paid per session for their hour long sessions. 
Topics for professional development will include aligning lessons to the grade level learning 
standards, implementation of best practices using ELL strategies, resources and techniques, 
analyzing various assessments and interpretation of data (including most recent NYSESLAT, 
ELA and Math results) to drive instruction. This will provide an opportunity for collaboration 
between the ENL teachers and classroom teachers in order to better serve our ELLs with 
appropriate scaffolds and resources to achieve success in all academic areas. These PD sessions 
will be run by the ENL teachers and ELL Coordinator, Tara Weiss, who will present current 
topics from research based articles and turn keying information from out of the 
building professional development series such as Academic Research Rounds and the ELL 
Liaison meetings . Teachers will also attend appropriate Professional Development workshops 
and meetings held by NYC DOE Department of English Language Learners and Student Support 
and Queens North Borough Field Support Center. Agendas and sign-in sheet will be provided 
and kept in the ENL classroom for reference as needed. The rationale for our ongoing Title III 
Professional Development is to provide teachers with the tools and time to collaborate in order to 
meet the needs of ELLs and provide them with opportunities to progress in their academic 
English language learning.  

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Begin description here:            
We will conduct 2 workshops (fall and spring) open to all ELL parents and families throughout 
the year for parents from 2:30pm-3:30pm. These workshops will be in addition to the mandated 
annual parent meetings as per CR-Part 154, Parent/Teacher conferences and all other Parent 
Engagement sessions on Tuesdays. Workshops will be conducted by 2 ENL teachers with 
bilingual support staff (Polish, Spanish, Arabic) and we will utilize the language line 
and translation services as needed for any translations needed. A survey will be sent home for 
parents to indicate which topics would be most useful and engaging to them as well as dates of 
availability. In order to notify parents of these activities, bilingual letters will be distributed (in 
the home languages needed). Agendas and sign-in sheets will be provided in order to keep track 
of which families attended the workshops. Each hour long workshop will focus on a different 
theme connected to building the bridge between home and school and provide parents with home 
activities for families to engage in to support their child's learning. Topics will range from how 
to support students at home and tools to motivate language learning and development at home in 
both English and the families home language. Due to the diverse linguistic background of the 
ELL families at 113, we will continue to provide Rosetta stone online accounts for the parents to 
install on their home computers in order for them to work with their child at home and increase 
their own English language learning. Students are invited to join their parents as these are tools 
for the entire family. Parents will fill out a feedback form at the sessions to say if the sessions 
met their needs and what else could be helpful at future sessions. The ENL teachers will track the 
usage of the program online and reach out to the families to survey how the program was useful 
and helpful as well as track the use of the program online. At 113 we respect and honor the home 
language of our families and want to provide them support that is meaningful and useful.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
1. Our school uses Ready Gen,  on-demand writing, Fountas and Pinnell, the NYC Performance Task Assessments (MOSL) and I-
Ready to assess the literacy skills of our ELLs.  ENL teachers use an ENL Monitoring tool and rubric to assess the areas of need 
and progress of all ELL students in the four language modalities (speaking, listening, reading and writing)The results tell us that 
children who have early English Language experience are more likely to do well on these assessments and therefore need 
authentic experiences in the English language. This information provided by the data helps teachers plan effective lessons with 
multiple entry points. Those students who need more support in English language learning are targeted for support with 
language scaffolds and home language support in order for them to have success in all content areas. The classroom teachers 
and the ENL teachers  conference during preparation periods to discuss student data and collaborate to provide appropriate 
lessons with scaffolds that enrich authentic experiences in the English language for all ELL students. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2. The ENL teachers and classroom teachers work together to monitor the ELL students progress throughout the school year. 
The ENL teachers and classroom teachers analyze formative assessments throughout the school year during common-prep 
time and during the professional work time on Tuesdays from 3:00pm-3:35pm. All ELL students are exposed to authentic 
experiences in the English language through the use of teacher made lessons, assessments, on-demand writing 
tasks, Fountas and Pinnell, i-Ready assessments and Ready Gen lessons and assessments that align to the Common Core 
Standards and formative assessments. The collaboration of teachers provides the support ELL students need in order to 
receive appropriate and enriching experiences in all content areas. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
3. The ENL teachers use an ENL Monitoring tool and rubric to assess the areas of need and progress of all ELL students in the 
four language modalities (speaking, listening, reading and writing) as well as the NYC Performance Task Assessments (MOSL) 
and on-demand writing. The ENL teacher and classroom teachers work together to analyze student progress while identifying 
the areas of need throughout the year during common prep time. ELL student data shows us that support in sentence fluency 
is an area of need. The ELL teacher and classroom teachers collaborate to provide scaffolds and access to grade appropriate 
lessons to support ELL students. Parents continue to request the ENL classes for their children. ELLs are receiving the help they 
need to be successful as indicated by the progress on assessment data in all subject areas and progress on the NYSESLAT. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

4. The ENL teachers and classroom teachers work together to monitor the ELL students progress throughout the school year. 
The ENL teachers and classroom teachers analyze summative assessments throughout the school year during common-prep 
time and during the professional work time on Tuesdays from 3:00pm-3:35pm. The structures in place to address the 
interventions needed based on the data are implemented by the ENL teachers and classroom teachers collaboration planning 
language scaffolds and supports such as sentence de/reconstruction and vocabulary enrichment. All ELL students are exposed 
to authentic experiences in the English language through the use of teacher made lessons and Ready Gen lessons that align to 
the Common Core Standards and the summative assessments. These assessment guide our student groupings and lesson 
planning to meet the needs of the students. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
5.  The school uses data from on-demand writing,  the NYC Performance Task Assessments (MOSL), Fountas and Pinell, 
Iready, the state ELA and Math exams to guide instruction for ELLs with in the RTI framework. Teachers analyze trends in the 
students data over time as well as in their student work. ELL students who need to receive RTI services receive skill-based tier 
2 and 3 instruction. This requires collaboration between the ENL teacher, classroom teacher, and RTI instruction, who meet 
during common prep time or during professional work time on Tuesdays from 3:00pm-3:35pm. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
6.  Newcomer English Language Learners usually score at the Entering Level of the NYSITELL. For Kindergarten and Grade 1, the 
reading and writing sections of the NYSESLAT are challenging.The listening and speaking sections are difficult for students of all 
grade levels at the Entering and Emerging English proficiency levels. For Grades 2 and up the reading and writing have always 
been more difficult for children to pass at the Transitioning and Expanding English proficiency levels. ELLs of all levels struggle 
on the state ELA and Math exam due to the rigorous reading and writing content. Data shows us that our ELL students must 
acquire a broad range of vocabulary, fluency and sentence structure building in order to succeed in both expressive and 
receptive language assessments. This data guides our instruction of ELLs with the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher.ENL 
teachers and classroom teachers analyze data about their ELL students and plan instruction to meet the areas of need of their 
linguistically diverse students.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

7. Data drives our instruction and programming. Students are grouped according to their grade level (2 consecutive grade 
levels) and English language proficiency levels. The ENL teachers work together with the classroom teachers in order to 
provide support for ELLs in the appropriate programming. The ENL teachers and classroom teachers collaborate during prep 
periods on on Tuesdays from 3:00pm-3:35pm. Each modality is addressed through authentic content and scaffolds are 
provided in the areas of need based on the data. For example, students who struggle with sentence fluency are introduced to 
sentence de/reconstruction. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

1.  At PS/IS 113Q our small population of ELL students is represented in almost every grade and by several different 
home languages. A Freestanding ENL program serves our students’ needs. The ENL teacher and the classroom teacher 
work closely to plan curriculum alignment to ensure that all instruction meets the literacy and content area needs of 
our ELL students. Our Freestanding ENL program includes students of two consecutive grade bands receiving 
Integrated and Stand-Alone ENL instructed by a certified ENL teacher who has a common branch license as well. ELL's 
are grouped heterogeneously (All proficiency levels) due to the small number of ELLs per consecutive grade band. All 
ELL students receive 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA and Entering and Emerging ELL students receive another 180 
minutes of Stand-Alone ENL. Former ELLs receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA. Our 2nd  and 4th grade ELLs 
receive 180 minutes of Integrated and 180 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL from certified ENL teachers  who are also their 
classroom teachers.

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 2. The ENL teacher is also a certified common branch teacher and provides 180 Intergrated ENL/ELA instruction to Entering, 
Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding  ELLs. Former ELLs receive 90 minutes of Intergrated ENL/ELA instruction. Entering and 
Emerging ELLs receive another 180 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL from the certified ENL teacher. Our 2nd 4th  grade ELLs have 
dual certified ENL classroom teachers. The Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding 2nd  and 4th  grade ELLs receive 
180 minutes of Intergrated ENL/ELA embedded into their classes ELA time. Entering and Emerging 2nd and 4th  grade students 
receive another 180 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL from their ENL certified classroom teachers. 2 nd and 4th grade  Former ELLs 
receive 90 minutes of Intergrated ENL/ELA from the certified ENL classroom teachers as well. All teachers in the ENL program 
provide ELL students of all proficiency levels opportunities to engage in higher order thinking and exposure to engaging texts 
and resources. The ENL program provides students with multiple entry points to content area instruction through the use of 
language scaffolds, home language support and enriches materials and resources.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core

 3. The ENL teacher plans her lessons in the different content areas using English as the medium of instruction. Our students go 
through a rigorous Common Core based curriculum. Instruction includes read aloud, partner reading, individualized reading, 
guided reading, interactive reading, accountable talk, collaborative learning, as well as modeling which allows the students to 
develop basic interpersonal communication skills and cognitive academic language proficiency. The ENL teacher utilizes a 
variety of instructional materials including communication skills and cognitive academic language proficiency. The ENL teacher 
utilizes a variety of Common Core based instructional materials including Code X, Ready Gen, Go Math, manipulative for math 
and science, computers technology, leveled library books and Common Core non-fiction texts. Classroom teachers 
differentiate instruction for ELL students. Peer instruction and cooperative learning with other students helps facilitate English 
acquisition. Some content area materials are available in our languages. When available ELL students are provided with 
translated versions of current curriculum materials in order to ease the acquisition to English (e.g. science curriculum materials 
are available in Spanish and provided to students when appropriate). The ENL teacher works closely with classroom teachers 
to integrate content area work in ELA with ENL instruction to make it more comprehensible using language scaffolds such as 
vocabulary word choice packets, visual literacy scaffolds and sentence de/reconstruction. ELLs are given enriching materials, 
engaging texts and resources to acquire English through the content areas. All teachers are encouraged to use home language 
materials when available. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

 4.   Spanish speaking students who failed the NYSITELL are tested with the Spanish LAB to deteremine their language 
dominance. Children who speak other languages bring their knowledge and skills from prior learnings to their ENL classes. 
Ideas, skills and knowledge are used for evaluation purposes. Home language serves as support for the child in the ENL class. 
The teacher can involve a new student in class activities by allowing him to respond through drawing, reading, retelling in the 
home language. All teachers utilize techonology, such as Ipads, to translate vocabulary words and content for newcomers 
students. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

5.  A. P.S./I.S. currently does not have any SIFE students.B. ELLs in the US less than three years are targeted for 
Fundations lessons, Iready lessons, Lexia by Rosetta Stone lessons, visual literacy lesson, vocabulary scaffolds, sentence 
structure tools  and targeted lessons during Stand-Alone ENL. C. For ELLs receiving service 4-6 years, classroom teachers and 
ENL teachers target lessons, skills and strategies to help students prepare for state exams and meet the common core 
standards in ELA. In addition, the ENL teacher provides additional language skills practice to foster fluency and comfort in the 
English Language. Scaffolding for ELL students includes vocabulary, sentence and paragraph writing tools and scaffolds, 
reading complex engaging texts, classroom discussions, listening activities and visual literacy lessons. ELLs students are 
provided multiple entry points in to the content areas.D. The ENL teacher and classroom teachers identify the special needs of 
these students and provides multiple entry points to lessons through the use of scaffolds and strategies. This guides the 
success and raises the achievement level of these students.E. Former ELLs are given all testing accommodations and receive 90 
minustes of Intergrated ENL/ELA from the ENL teacher in order to meet common care standards and prepare for state exams. 
Former ELLs are provided with appropriate and engaging scaffolds for grade appropriate content area instruction. These 
students are challenged and engaged in language strategies and activities.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Our education materials correspond to our ELL students’ ages and grade levels. Teachers use common planning to discuss 
content area texts which include common core non-fiction books. ENL and special education classroom teachers discuss skill 
strategies and best practices for all students including ELLs and SWDs. Some examples would be utilizing small group 
instruction, one-on-one instruction, and peer group work to enable ELL-SWDs to receive content area instruction that best 
meets their needs. ELL-SWDs are included in mini lessons to model the skill to demonstrate understanding. Teachers

students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The ENL teacher works with the Pupil accounting secretary when parents register their students. The ENL teacher 
conducts an interview with both the student and parent before the HLIS form is filled out. If the parent is unable 
to communicate in English the ENL teacher calls the Translation and Interpretation Unit. All parent information is 
filled out in the preferred language and any questions are answered using the Translation and Interpretation Unit 
phone number if needed. Teachers and staff also look at ATS Report of Preferred Languages, Blue Card data, 
Parent Surveys, and Teacher Surveys. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

The ENL teachers and Parent Coordinator meet with teachers and all staff members to share information about 
translation and interpretation rights and resources available. At PS/IS 113 we use the Translation and Interpretation 
Unit and the Language Line if we do not have a staff member who can translate the parents preferred language. This 
information is shared with all staff members.

  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

At PS/IS 113 we have visible translated signage and brochures in the main office, parent coordinators office and 
security desk that provide parents the opportunities to indicate they have the right ot receive information in their 
preferred language. We also translate flyers and letters shared with all parents in preferred languages. We use the 
Translation and Interpretation Unit and Language Line if we do not have a staff member who can translate the 
documents needed or translate orally.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

At PS/IS 113 we use the Translation and Interpretation Unit if we do not have a staff member who can translate the 
documents needed or translate orally. All ELL parent letters and surveys are sent home in the preferred language of 
the parent. All staff members communicate with parents and implement translation and interpretations the preferred 
for future communication. The ENL teachers and Parent Coordinator also meeting with staff members to translation 
resources and materials as needed.
