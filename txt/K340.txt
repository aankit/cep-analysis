Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

 

Mission  

As a school community, we are committed to the development of the whole child: intellectually and academically, 
personally and socially, physically and emotionally. We believe that all students can achieve their full potential with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

the support of the school and their parents. In working collaboratively, we can ensure that value is added to all 
students so that they achieve at high levels and develop as individuals. 

Vision  

We see our school as a place where all members of our school community are lifelong learners. Collaboratively, we 
will support each other needs, celebrate our cultural diversity, and create an atmosphere that is safe and conducive 
to learning. We will be flexible, responsible, accountable, and adaptable to change. The members of our community 
will have respect for themselves and others. We will work with different constituents to create a learning 
environment where there is effective teaching and learning to improve achievement for all students.  
 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
North Star Academy is a small community middle school (grades 6 – 8) with 207 scholars from 6 through grade 8. The 
school population comprise of 73.43% Black, 19.81% Hispanic, 2.9% American Indian or Alaskan Native, 1.45% White, 
0.97% Multi-Racial, and 0.48% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander scholars. Males account for 57% of scholars 
enrolled and females account for 43%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2017-2018 was 93.1% 

The development of literacy skills in our scholars are embedded across content areas to ensure that scholars are 
prepared to meet the demands of the common core standards. Across the content areas, scholars engaged in reading 
and writing tasks that require thinking critically, to state claims and defend them with text based evidence, exposed 
to complex texts, and engage in discussions with their peers to explore concepts. In addition to developing scholars' 
academic ability we are also committed to empowering more resilient and engaged scholars who can positively 
contribute the the community.  

As a school community, we work collaboratively to create a safe learning environment that is welcoming and 
respectful of all members. Our advisory program is delivered to all students and addresses topics that will help 
students develop positive habits, healthy relationships, prepare for high school and beyond, and explore issues that 
impact our society. Trained pedagogues utilize Restorative Practices, a framework for building community and for 
responding to challenging behavior through authentic dialogue. 

North Star Academy partners with the Urban Advantage program, a collaboration between DOE schools and major 
science institutions throughout the city (American Museum of Natural History, NY Hall of Science, Botanical Garden, 
Bronx Zoo, Staten Island Zoo). Through this partnerships, teachers are able to engage in professional development at 
these institutions which allow them to utilize the various institutions as a way to connect classroom learning to real 
world examples. 

In addition, our partnership with University Settlement allows us the opportunity to host a comprehensive extend 
learning program. Program offerings include the areas of athletics, performing arts, visual arts, academic support and 
enrichment, technology and STEM education. Our extensive after school program provide scholars with opportunities 
to experience rich extracurricular activities. 

We are staffed with administrators, support staff, and dedicated teachers who are committed to the quality 
education of our scholars. All teachers are certified in their areas of expertise and work diligently to ensure that each 
scholar in the classroom is learning. They maintain regular contact with the home to keep families informed of how 
their children are progressing, and make themselves available during weekly parent engagement sessions for parent 
conferences. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

We welcome parent participation and active involvement in the daily activities. We have various means for which 
parents can become involved via the Parent Teacher Association, School Leadership Team, and Parent Volunteerism, 
and other parent committees.  

Students attending North Star Academy have an opportunity to participate in the following enrichment activities:  

● Elective Courses  

● Student Government  

● Yearbook Club  

● Girls Empowerment Movement (GEM) Program  

● CHAMPS Fitness and Sports Programs: Flag Football, Flag Rugby, Boys Basketball  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The student body includes 2.9% English Language Learners. We currently have three ICT classes (one on each grade) 
and one Self-contained 6-8 Bridge Class. The total number of students with Individualized Education Plans (IEP) is 45, 
which represents 21.74% of student population. Of the students with IEPs: 

  11.11% receive Related Services only 
  31.11% receive partial Special Education classroom services 
  31.11% receive mostly Special Education classroom services 
  11.11% receive Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) classes  
  15.56% received Self-Contained services 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Progress  

According to the results of the 2017 New York State Common Core English Language Arts and Math Assessments, 
33.5% of the students achieved proficiency levels 3 and 4 (1% increase) and 21% of the students achieved proficiency 
levels 3 and 4 (3.6% increase), respectively.  

While we demonstrated an increase in both ELA and Math, we are not where we would like to be. Therefore it was 
concluded that the instructional focus for this academic school year would be developing authentic tasks and looking 
closely at data to drive our instructional decisions. Hence, our instructional focus is:  

All students will graduate from MS 340 with a clear vision about their college and career readiness goals as they 
work toward planning a future as a productive adult. Instruction is designed to meet students’ individual 
instructional needs. All students will be exposed to a wide range and volume of reading and writing strategies 
which will help students strengthen their level of critical thinking to help them analyze the world they live in, their 
role, as well as how they handle struggle productively. MS 340 will create a tri-fold partnership in which we provide 
opportunities for families to understand literacy success, how their children are progressing, which will result in 
skills and strategies to best support their children. 

 

For the 2018-2019 academic year, we have two key areas of focus: Supportive Environment and Collaborative 
Teachers. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

We are putting various systems into place that will support scholars social-emotional development. Some practices 
include but are not limited to the implementation of the STAR (Standing Together Around Respect) team, Beyond 
Differences initiative, Restorative Practices, and the PBIS Pay check Incentive Program. Theses initiatives will promote 
a positive school climate and school culture that will lead to student achievement.  

As for teacher teams, we are committed to developing effective team structures, such as uses protocols to help guide 
the group work and provide a consistent framework, utilizing meeting norms that are agreed upon and clear, and 
meeting agendas that are relative, purposeful, and understood. The work of our teacher teams will focus on looking 
at student work, data analysis, and lesson planning as a means to improve instructional and professional practice.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. North Star Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

North Star Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

  Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math and use of technology. 

  Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children. 
Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress. 

  Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments. 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand. 

  Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community.  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

  Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 

Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact. 

  Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills. 

  Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact. 
Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills. 

  Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office. 

  Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 

accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home.  

  Provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report. 

  Host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).  
Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions.  

 

  Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed.  
  Conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 

workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help. 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

  Holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference. 
  Hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school 

year. 

  Encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-

Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. 
Supporting or hosting Family Day events. 



children’s progress. 

  Developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about 

school activities and student progress. 

  Providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a 

format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.  

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

North Star Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards on assessments. 

 

Provide high-quality curriculum and instruction consistent with State Standards to enable participating children to

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school utilized 2 assessments to measure the early literacy skills of our ELLs: the DRP and Running Record. At the 
beginning of the school year, the ELL student was administered the DRP assessment, which provided the student's 
independent reading level and the instructional reading level according to Fountas and Pinnell. After the student was 
administered the DRP and it was determined that she tested at least 3 grades below reading level, she was administered a 
running recording at her independent reading level to determine if the reading deficiency was comprehension or phonetics. 
After administering the running record it was determined that she needs to work on reading comprehension, word study, and 
fluency. The results of these assessments provide data for the ENL: teacher to determine the priorities in her instructional 
practice, and how to effectively drive her instruction for optimal student achievement. Based on the assessment results 
the ENL instructor provides levels corresponding to the DRP levels. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

In order to meet the needs of our ESL student, we will hire a part-time ENL instructor for two days weekly who will work with 
ESL students as well as four former ELLs. The ENL instructor will work alongside the teachers to develop an instructional plan 
to increase English language proficiency for the one ELL student as well as to further enhance the English Language proficiency 
for the students identified as commanding according to the NYSESLAT. 
Teachers will work collaboratively to create a learning environment that orients them into the second language while 
maintaining pride in their own cultural and linguistic heritage. The English as a Second Language (ESL) program will provide 
comprehensive instruction as well as word study. It is the expectation that ESL program will provide opportunities for students 
to have access to quality education aligned to CCLS standards and the four language modalities: speaking, reading, writing, and 
listening. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of the entire program is measured by the NYSESLAT scores. NYSESLAT results along with DRP results, the ELL 
Periodic Assessments, state tests scores, and school assessments are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the ESL program. In 
the school year 2016-2017, all of our ESL students passed the NYSESLAT. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered, teachers will have detailed information about their students' strengths and 
challenges as it relates to the development of the English Language. This information will serve as a guide for planning 
differentiated instruction based on individual needs 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
According to the results of the NYSELAT, four students are commanding and require 90 minutes of ESL instruction and one 
student is transitioning and require 180 minutes of ESL instruction. The ELL Data Analysis Tool for our ESL student is showing 
progress in listening, as well as speaking, while reading and writing skills are a challenge. She will be assigned individualized 
work on her reading level and will be assessed for progress ongoing. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

These findings help make adjustments in planning ENL lessons, making more emphasis on language modalities according to to 
students' needs. 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

 

The mandated instructional minutes are met because the ENL instructor provides the five ELL students with push-
instruction two times weekly. The two students identified as commanding receive 90 minutes total per week. The 
student identified as transitioning receives 180 minutes per week. Students received ESL instruction in the content 
area class alongside the content area teacher and ENL instructor. Instruction is exclusively given in English and is 
differentiated based on ability and interests.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The mandated instructional minutes are met because the ENL instructor provides the five ELL students with push-instruction 
two times weekly. The two students identified as commanding receive 90 minutes total per week. The student identified as 
transitioning receives 180 minutes per week. Students received ESL instruction in the content area class alongside the content 
area teacher and ENL instructor. Instruction is exclusively given in English and is differentiated based on ability and interests. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In addition to the push-in program, ELL students receive instruction using the workshop model in all the major subjects. 
Students are given access to all programs, mandated services, and extra-curricular activities. The general education staff is 
given appropriate support and professional development to assist ELL students effectively. Data from the various assessments 
stated above are used to make informed decisions on language use for subject areas. All instruction is delivered in English 
through the use of ESL methodology. Teachers integrate modeling, bridging, and contextualization techniques to scaffold 
instruction for ELL students, utilizing reliable technology translators when necessary. Explicit vocabulary instruction supports 
language acquisition. Students who require home language scaffolds for the content area will be given translated work. 
Graphic organizers and visuals are used as a tool to develop students’ writing skills. During common prep time, the content 
area teacher and ENL instructor will meet to review students’ progress and plan instruction. Specifically, the ENL instructor will 
review lesson plans and unit plans regularly to ensure curriculum alignment. The administration provides for common planning 
sessions to ensure that: 
1) Teachers provide students with opportunities to be involved in purposeful conversations. 
2) All language modalities are incorporated into the lesson. 
3) There is an ongoing collaboration between content area teachers and the ENL teacher to create a learning community that 
is knowledgeable about the linguistic needs of ELL students. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

All students, regardless of proficiency level, are required to take the city-wide and state assessments. ELL students will be given 
copies of assessments in their home language translation when available. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

A) ELL students are given time and a half during assessments to ensure that they have the best opportunity possible. This will 
guide instruction and the delivery of Academic Intervention Services (AIS). We will provide small group instruction that focuses 
on language acquisition, word study, and vocabulary development to help students become beginning readers. They will

also use individualized computer programs to develop listening comprehension and basic reading skills. 
B)Newcomers, students with less than three years in the US, do not represent any students at MS 340. 
C) The students receiving ESL services from four to six years perform well in listening and speaking, while reading and writing 
represent a challenge. They are assigned individualized supplemental work so they can have additional at-home practice to 
accelerate their progress. Based on data from the NYSESLAT and comparison of previous year levels on this test, we focus on 
areas of weakness and service these students in our ESL program during the day in order to enhance language acquisition. To 
build their reading fluency, they read books on their independent reading level both in school and at home. To enhance their 
writing skills, the ENL instructor models the writing process and uses graphic organizers to assist students in sequencing as well 
as organizing their writing. 
D) Long Term ELLs, with more than five years of service, do not represent any students at MS 340. 
E) Since all students are expected to meet CCLS, our instructional program offers all students, including our special needs 
students, the opportunity to receive instruction in literacy and math weekly. During the day, students all grouped according to 
DRP levels and receive small group instruction in literacy based on their needs. During after-school, students have the 
opportunity to partake in activities such as NBA Math, MAD Science, Newspaper Club, and Specialized High School Prep. In 
math, students use manipulatives and graphic organizers to assist with differentiated instruction. In science and social studies, 
students use images and graphic organizers to illustrate concepts, as well as organize ideas. ELLs with special needs have 
guided instruction that match their IEPs goals that is planned by the General Education Teacher, Special Education Teacher, 
and ENL Instructor. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
To accelerate English language development we offer our ELLs students various resources, including materials such as 
classroom libraries, Study Sync, and Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT. 
Oral communication skills are developed through the use of Read-Alouds, Shared Reading experiences, and technology is used 
to enrich the curriculum across the content areas. Classroom teachers differentiate instruction to engage students in the 
writing process. All classroom are required to be print-rich in order for students to provide visual support for cognitive 
language acquisition. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our ELL-SWDs receive mandated services weekly. They are also mainstreamed in general education classes for Art, Music, and 
Physical Education. The literacy curriculum, Study Sync, includes instructional support for ELL and SWD. Teachers provide 
multiple entry points for students to access the curriculum in their content area. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Students in need of intervention services receive small group instruction in ELA and Math during the Strategic Reading periods 
weekly. Reading intervention services are given through researched-based intervention programs such as Wilson, STARI, and 
small group guided reading groups. Math intervention is done through small-group instruction based on the results of data 
such as classroom assessments, Periodic Assessments, and NYS CC Assessments. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

For the 2017-2018 school year, we hired a part-time ENL instructor to provide instruction for ELLs. Our ESL students benefit 
from getting additional instructional support. Our ENL teacher will also push-in to core content classrooms for her ELL students 
to ensure support of adequate differentiation and scaffolding. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All students are offered the opportunity to participate in extra-curricular activities. Students are heterogeneously grouped 
within each grade. Students are offered ESL content area instruction that is CCLS-aligned in ELA, Math, Science and Social 
Studies. Besides receiving the mandated ESL services, students receive 45-90 minutes of ELA instruction daily. In addition, our 
instructional program offers all students, including ELLs, grade and age appropriate day, after-school enrichment programs. 
Their program also includes electives such as art, technology, dance, sports, cooking, Newspaper club, and MAD Science club. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
To accelerate English language development we offer our ELLs students various resources, including materials such as 
classroom libraries, Study Sync, and Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT. 
 
Oral communication skills are developed through the use of Read-Alouds and Shared Reading experiences, and technology is 
used to enrich the curriculum across the content areas. Classroom teachers differentiate instruction to engage students in 
the writing process. All classroom are required to be print-rich in order for students to provide visual support for cognitive 
language acquisition. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

The ENL instructor collaborates with content area teachers to determine what support is needed in content areas. Native 
language support is frequently provided by our literacy teachers in the content area classroom. Content area teachers provide 
written instructions and guidelines in students' native language to foster comprehension, academic and language 
development. In addition, ELL students use bilingual dictionaries and glossaries and online translation resources as needed. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
To accelerate English language development we offer our ELLs students various resources, including materials such as 
classroom libraries, Study Sync, and Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We have developed a process for the staff to meet with the parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. In 
order to ensure this occurs, pedagogues have weekly meeting times available on Tuesdays during parent Engagement to meet 
with parents. In addition, student progress reports are sent home four times a year - October, December, February, and May. 
The ENL instructor communicates with parents on a needed basis. If translation serves are needed they are provided. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Tamara Johnson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
