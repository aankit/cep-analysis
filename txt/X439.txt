Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Teachers work hard to engage the students in interesting class discussions. We engage students academically and 
culturally via ongoing programs including: Community Service, Women of Strength, Men of Strength, JROTC, lunch 
and after-school tutoring, and Saturday enrichment and remediation programs. Additionally, all students are invited 
to meet with the principal for lunch, weekly, to address concerns and share ideas to improve our school. We foster a 
climate of success by tying rewards and privileges to scholastic achievement, attendance, behavior, and perseverance. 
Teachers, parents, and administrators monitor students’ progress via our online community, Skedula; and decisions 
are made in collaboration with individual students during numerous regularly-scheduled appointments with guidance 
counselors throughout the year. Students may take part in sports teams with other schools in the Theodore Roosevelt 
Educational Campus, which has two gyms, swimming pools, and a weight room. 

Our school fosters strategic partnerships with community based and professional organizations to enrich the 
educational experiences of both students and staff and supporting our ongoing cultural shift.

Bronx High School for Law and Community Service is a learning community comprised of 420 students, 50 staff 
members, and countless extended family members. Our student population’s ethnic origins are 60% Latino, 38% 
Black, and 1% Asian and African. 89% of our students qualify for free or reduced lunch, 23% of our students receive 
special education services, and 20% of our students are English language learners. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The majority of students at Bronx High School for Law and Community Service have an interest in law or law 
enforcement. Students may study the criminal justice system and volunteer in their community. The school offers 
classes in forensics, criminal justice, constitutional law, and law enforcement. There is also courtroom within the 
school to conduct mock trials. 17% of our students are ELL students and 27% of students are SWDs. Data shows that 
these special populations do not perform as highly on writing tasks on state exams as their general education peers.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
The school's strengths relative to rigorous instruction are preparing students for the next grade level and asking 
students to think critically. According to the NYC School Quality Guide, 87% of students say they are learning a lot in 
their classes at their school to prepare them for the next grade. Additionally, 75% of students say that their classes at 
their school make them think critically. (Q4g) 

 

The priority need that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element is regarding student 
discussion in the classroom. According to the 2018 Quality Review report, "Students across classrooms produce 
meaningful work products, though in some cases, there are missed opportunities for students to engage in student-
to-student discussions and deepen their learning." Additionally, 50% of students say they are challenged in their 
classes according to the NYC School Quality Guide.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 95% of classes will implement a minimum of two discussion protocols occurring at least once weekly 
resulting in a 10% increase in teachers being rated effective or highly effective in Danielson component 3B - Questioning 
and Discussion Techniques and a 5% increase in student responses to questions pertaining to rigorous instruction on the 
Learning Environment Survey.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
The US and NYS Department of Education defines a HQT as a teacher who is fully licensed and teaching in the license 
area. We recruit teachers for vacancies who are licensed in the vacancy area.  

 

The strategies and activities to ensure these HQT receive professional development include but are not limited to:  

 

 Allowing teachers to engage in instructional activities based on observed/stated student needs and interests. For 
example, when it is determined that a number of students require remediation in order to develop the skills and 
strategies necessary to meet with success on various state-mandated assessment teachers leverage their rapport with 
students to encourage them to attend study sessions or afterschool tutoring.  

 Teachers are welcome to present course ideas to the administration. As long as student interest exists, it 
contributes to the overall goals of the school and scheduling permits for it, these classes are developed. Currently this 
seen with the recent development of an astronomy class, a publishing course, a photography course, a Grade 9 study 
skills program and the Mock Trial/Moot Court teams.  

 The ongoing discussion and creation of Advanced Placement and other courses that appeal to students who have 
completed the state-mandated requirements for graduation but who continue to seek academic challenges and for 
teachers seeking to work with students who demand a cognitive challenge.  

 The development and implementation of a Summer Bridge Program wherein students are able to get of “taste” of 
the expectations that will be faced with before they officially start BLCS in September. This also allows the teachers to 
gain some insight into the abilities of incoming students and prepare well in advance to meet their needs.  

 Providing teachers with timely and relevant feedback in the form of emails and formal conferences pertaining to 
their classroom practices and procedures via frequent mini-observations and period-long formal observations  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 

 The development of teacher-led hiring committees to ensure that candidates are not only highly–qualified in their 
subject areas, but also share common beliefs about students and the learning process with those already working in 
the BLCS community.  

 Partnerships with organizations such as the Justice Resource Center to assist in the development of law-based 
elective courses, internships and work opportunities that serve as motivation for students who have primarily chosen 
to attend BLCS because of a desire to enter the field of law once they have completed their education.  

 The greater portion of funds are allocated to the support of teachers in their respective classrooms, specifically the 
purchase of curricular materials, technology and other supplies essential to the development of a positive learning 
environment.  

 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Scholarship Report Conferences are conducted with each teacher to assess challenges and to identify successful 
practices that could be expanded upon to assist all students with meeting success.  

 Consistent implementation of common planning time into each teacher’s program.  

 The possession of three assistant principals with various specialties that are available to teachers whenever the 
need arises.  

 Lead teachers are available to the assist the staff each day  

 Teachers participate in workshops with New Visions and work with their respective departments to develop 
necessary skills.  

 A mathematics and ELA teacher participate in professional development with CUNY to facilitate the development of 
a college-based curriculum aimed at preparing students that are not deemed “College Ready” according to Regents 
scores for the rigors of credit-bearing first year coursework.  

 Teachers in designated content areas wherein student proficiency levels are consistently rising will receive training 
from the College Board’s Advanced Placement Institutes to further to foster the development of courses and 
curriculum that engage students in rigorous college preparatory instruction and increase their performance on 
culminating exams.  

 The Danielson Framework and Advance will be used to inform teacher’s individual professional development needs 
in terms of pedagogical practices  

 Data derived from formative, summative and culminating assessments will be used to inform teacher’s professional 
development needs in terms of the development of curriculum and learning activities that best suit students’ 
demonstrated needs, strengths, deficiencies and the demands set forth by mandated assessments.

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
During the Bronx High School for Law and Community Service Collaborative Professional Planning and Preparation 
Conference during the week of September 5, 2016-September 9, 2016, teachers created all benchmark assessments 
for each course they teach for the school year. Additionally, the data harnessed from ongoing communication with 
teachers and the data provided in Skedula contributes to the assessment process. The data is then analyzed and 
students programs are adjusted according to their needs. During actual terms, students may be assigned to specific 
seminar classes or academic intervention programs that have been put in place. In January, when students are 
programmed for the second semester, the data is used to ensure that student programs reflect the identified needs. 
Teacher schedules have been coordinated to ensure that time is allocated for AIS services, student conferencing and 
the inclusion of intensive seminars in core content areas. Teachers are a part of a Professional Learning Community, 
during which they will design and implement new classroom assessments, including student self-assessments. The 
school-wide grading policy is 47.5% formative assessment, 47.5% summative assessment and 5% student self-
assessment.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Bronx High School for Law and Community Service, in compliance with the 
Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a 
parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the 
School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed 
members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Bronx High School for Law and Community Service will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand; 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community;  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  Title I Priority and Focus Schools and the parents of students served in the Title I program must jointly agree 
upon the use of these additional funds to support increased parent engagement/education to enable parents 
to effectively support their child’s learning. 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; 

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; 
conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
 The purpose of our Title III program is to support our ELLs academically.  Our NYSESLAT 
and Regents data indicates that the majority of our English Language Learner population is a 
long-term ELL.  Additionally, Regents and scholarship data indicates that ELL students are 
continuing to struggle in their content-area courses.  In order to address these concerns, students 
will be served by an after-school language acquisition instructional program.  The program will 
begin on September 24, 2018 and end on June 10, 2019.   All ELLs will participate in the after-
school program.  This includes newcomers and long-term ELLs at each level of English 
proficiency.  Former ELLs who are missing Regents exams or credits will also be invited to 
participate in the program.  This time will also be used to develop the literacy of our SIFE 
students.   Examples of topics covered during these instructional sessions include:  Essay 
Writing, Multiple Choice Strategies, Using Context Clues to Understand Unknown Words, 
Analyzing Primary Documents and Graphing.  The Writing Revolution will also drive language 
acquisition during these after school and Saturday sessions.  Tutoring materials are supplemental 
and distinct from those used for daily instruction.  In addition, students will receive native 
language support in each of the four content areas by our certified ENL instructor.  Students will 
be served Monday -Thursday from 3:00pm - 6:00pm.  The instructor is a certified ENL 
teacher.  Attendance will be taken by the certified ENL teacher and records kept by Ms. 
Almonte, pupil personnel secretary.  The language of instruction will be English, with native 
language support when available.  Additionally, a Saturday program will be offered for three 
hours each Saturday for the same purpose.  75 hours are allocated to our certified ENL instructor 
for the purpose of direct instruction either after school or on Saturday.  Parents of ELLs will be 
notified about these programs by letters home in the students’ native language, translated by our 
Parent Coordinator, or a translation service for low incidence languages.  Teacher per session 
rates @ $51.51 per hour for 35 hours is $1,802.85 going toward direct instruction of ELLs, 
which is 76% of the $2,366 allocated.

 In an effort to drive up Regents passing rates and meet our NYSESLAT AMAO, ESL teachers will use the 
Writing Revolution strategies to support and monitor writing development across the content-areas.  The 
Writing Revolution is a comprehensive writing program that teaches writing through content.   The 
professional development for the Writing Revolution program includes three full days of PD as well as direct 
teacher coaching through 4 on-site visits each year.  Fifteen teachers across all content areas will be trained 
over the course of the year.  The dates will be: Session I:  9/18, 10/26, and 11/6  and Session II:  9/25, 10/19, 
and 11/16.     
 All ENL professional development records will be maintained by the assistant principal to ensure all teachers 
are in compliance with 7.5 hours of training as per Jose P.    Agendas and attendance sheets will be kept on 
file with the payroll secretary, Fatimah Brito.    
 We communicate with teachers about all upcoming professional development opportunities.  Teachers are 
surveyed to determine on which topics they would like more training.  We communicate via email about all

higher on their social studies and ELA essays after a year of TWR.   
The goal of the Title III professional development is to support all teachers in their instruction of ELL 
students.  To this end, monies have been allotted for professional development sessions on The Writing 
Revolution.   
 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

Begin description here:            
  Parents/Guardians are entitled to regular conveyance of information pertaining to their child's 
progress and placement in the school.  The parents/guardians of these students will be informed 
in English and their native language regarding opportunities afforded to their children and the 
purpose of these opportunities via direct verbal communication and by letter written in English 
and the parent/guardian's native language prior to the commencement of the activity.  Our parent 
coordinator, three of our guidance counselors and our school secretary are all native Spanish 
speakers.  They translate necessary materials for our Spanish speaking parents.  Additionally, we 
use DOE translation for our low incident languages.  Additional communication will be made 
before the beginning of the second term to remind the parent/guardians of the program's 
continuance.  Furthermore, these parents/guardians will be provided access to the real-time 
progress of their children via the online grade book and progress report tool, Skedula.  This 
online program is the ENL teacher's primary form of communication with the parents/guardians 
of students in the program.  The communication will be enhanced with phone calls home as 
needed to address concerns or to apprise parents/guardians of students' progress or lack 
thereof.  Should the ENL teacher encounter a situation wherein she is presented with a language 
barrier, she will seek out translations services or a staff member who speaks a student's native 
language and is a licensed pedagogue.  The administration, a community assistant, a parent-
coordinator and a staff of four guidance counselors are available to address the needs, questions

and concerns of the students' and parents/guardians' native language.  Additionally, parent 
workshops regarding financial aid for college  will be conducted by a licensed ENL teacher 
during PTA meetings.  These will be offered at different times throughout the day in order to 
address parents' different schedules.  One session will be held 9:00 AM - 10:30 AM.  Workshops 
will be given by, Nelly Lopez, parent coordinator, Jessica Faugno, ENL teacher and Meredith 
Phelan, Assistant Principal.  Attendance records will be kept with agendas in the main office 
with Ms. Brito, secretary.  
 We will communicate with ELL and Title III parents about this meeting, and all meetings, by 
using the translated phone master telephone system.  Additionally, letters will go out in the 
parent's native language and information regarding the meetings will be emailed through Skedula 
to all students.  Students will also be sent home with a letter to give to their parents in the case 
that our other attempts at outreach are unsuccessful.   The rationale for these parent meetings, 
besides being in accordance with CR-Part 154 is to inform parents of their rights as parents of 
ELL students.   Additionally, it seeks to make parents of ELL students feel comfortable coming 
to school and interacting with their child's teachers and administrators.  It also affords them an 
opportunity to build a network of support with other parents of ELLs.  Our parent coordinator is 
paid $26.50 per hour to translate for parents at these meetings.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The assessment tool we use at Bronx High School for Law and Community Service to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs 
is Scholastic Phonics Inventory and Scholastic Reading Inventory. Students are first tested on the Scholastic Reading Inventory 
to determine their reading Lexile level. If a student tests below a third grade level, they are given the Scholastic Phonics 
Inventory to Page 44 determine whether or not the student is able to decode English words. In general data shows that 
students who test at the beginning level on the NYSESLAT cannot decode English words, as they have not mastered all 44 
sounds. Intermediate students are able to decode with ranging ability. Lexile scores show they read at anywhere from a first 
grade to eleventh grade reading level. This data informs our instructional decisions as the beginning ESL curriculum is centered 
on the 44 sounds of the English language and decoding skills. The ESL curriculum addresses reading comprehension deficits for 
students who are able to do decode.

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The assessment tool we use at Bronx High School for Law and Community Service to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs 
is Scholastic Phonics Inventory and Scholastic Reading Inventory. Students are first tested on the Scholastic Reading Inventory

on the 44 sounds of the English language and decoding skills. The ESL curriculum addresses reading comprehension deficits for 
students who are able to do decode.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We use data such as ELL graduation rate and AMAO progress indicators to measure the success of our programs for ELLs.  The 
NYSESLAT scores indicate students need additional suppor t in reading and writing English.  The success of each program is 
reviewed on an on-going basis and programs are continued or discontinued accordingly.      
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Assistant Principal Meredith Phelan is our data specialist and TESOL certified.  Several data points are regularly reviewed 
during various points throughout the year.  For example, summative Regents data is reviewed after each administration in 
January, June and August.  The ELL Regents data is brought by the data specialist to the weekly data dive for each cohort.  The 
principal, both assistant principals and guidance counselors are a part of each weekly data dive.  Based on the patterns we see, 
we make programmatic  decisions and design interventions for ELLs.  We use data such as ELL graduation rate and AMAO 
progress indicators to measure the success of our programs for ELLs.  The NYSESLAT scores indicate students need additional 
suppor t in reading and writing English.  The success of each program is reviewed on an on-going basis and programs are 
continued or discontinued accordingly.      
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Certain data patterns are revealed by the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT.  Across all performance levels and grades data reveals that 
the majority of students are commanding or expanding in listening and speaking, but transition, entering and emerging in 
reading and writing.  This data indicates that integrated and stand-alone ENL courses should emphasize literacy skills in the 
content-areas.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We have several structures in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to our programs.  Data is 
reviewed weekly in four different data dives, one per cohort.  The data specialist comes to the meeting ready with pertinent 
data based on the time of year.  Data includes NYSESLAT scores, scholarship data and Regents data.  Based on patterns, we 
discuss best course of action whether it be to continue an existing intervention or discontinue or add to programs for ELL 
students.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students are grouped in stand alone ENL by proficiency level.   Students in integrated ENL models are grouped by 
grade with heterogenous proficiency levels.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

        Only students who scored emerging and entering are placed in a free standing ENL class for 450 minutes each week.  They 
receive an additional 220 minutes through an integrated global history class.  Transitioning students receive 180 minutes of 
integrated ENL in a content-area and ELA course.  Expanding students receive 180 minutes each week of integrated ENL in a 
content-area or ELA course.  Students who are commanding or proficient receive 180 minutes each week of integrated ENL in 
a content-area or ELA course.     
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Content area instruction is delivered in English, but native language supports are an integral part of each content area class. 
Students use bilingual dictionaries and receive the mandated testing accommodations for ELL students. Teachers use a variety 
of audiovisual materials to promote student understanding. In order to foster language development that ensures our ELL 
students are ready to meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards, teachers explicitly teach Tier 2 vocabulary 
that students will see across all four major content areas. Teachers have received extensive training on the instruction of 
language through content. Additionally, stand alone ENL follows the Read 180 curriculum, which is content based and 
Common Core aligned, to provide them with extra support and preparedness for the CCLS. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Not only are students offered the opportunity to receive all assessments, except ELA, in their native language, but ENL 
students also take Native Language Arts. The HLA course allows us to track the development of students’ native language skills 
throughout the year. Content area teachers are required to provide all assessments in the students' native language to 
simulate real Regents testing conditions.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a.  All SIFE students are provided literacy instruction through their ENL class. Scholastic’s System 44 is a foundational reading 
and phonics intervention technology program designed for students who cannot decode sounds, which is the case for the 
majority of our SIFE students. Students learn to decode the 44 sounds of the English language through personalized learning 
through the computer program. Additionally, teachers providing services in core content areas receive resources and to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

further support the development and implementation of lessons to address the needs of SIFE students. 
b.   Students with less than three years in a US school (newcomers) are immediately accommodated through a “buddy system” 
wherein they are paired with a student who speaks the native language but has a stronger command of the English language 
and has been in the country longer. Through this buddy system, we hope to ease the culture shock and anxiety that comes 
with starting high school in a new country. Additionally, the System 44 and Read 180 program are designed to meet the 
language acquisition needs of newcomers as well as long term ELLs.   
c. and d.  We have increased the availability of services for developing students in an ENL program for 4-6 years and long term 
ELLsby providing an expanded tutoring program during the school day in the content areas and ESL. These students are closely 
monitored by the teaching staff and the guidance counselors for their attendance and their academic progress in respective 
subject areas. Strong emphasis has been placed on academic vocabulary development in the content area classroom and 
provided content area teachers with SIP training to ensure that students’ content knowledge is developed in conjunction with 
language development. Teachers are encouraged to engage students in activities that require frequent oral and written 
application of the English language in their respective content area classes. The goal for all 4-6 ELLs and long-term ELLs is to 
achieve proficiency by the end of the year.  
e.  Former ELL students receive all the testing modifications delineated in the New York State regulations for two years after 
being deemed proficient by the NYSESLAT or expanding of the NYSESLAT and earned a 65+ on their English Regents.   These 
accommodations include time extension on all exams, testing in a separate location, a third reading of the listening section on 
the ELA Regent exam, the provision of bilingual glossaries, the simultaneous use o English and Alternative Language Editions 
for all exams except ELA and LOTE, oral translations or lower-incident languages, the writing of responses in their native 
language. Teacher’s schedules have been designed to allow for collaboration between teachers, particularly between content 
area and the ESL teacher, to further enhance a teacher’s ability to assist transitional students. Teachers are made aware of 
transitional students in their classes. We do this by keeping a list of students readily available to all teachers. We get this list by 
running the RLAT in ATS for all students, not just entitled students. We then sort by students achieving proficiency within the 
last two years. We recognize the importance of this as some students will have achieved their passing score in middle school. 
Additionally, lunch time tutoring is offered to all students including transitional ELLs.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
SWD ELLs all receive instruction through Scholastic’s Read 180 or System 44 programs. Both programs are Common Core 
aligned and designed to help students master the reading skills defined by these standards. Read 180, for example, exposes 
students to a variety of genres in various content areas that become increasingly difficult as they progress. At the same time, it 
provides scaffolding support they need in order access these grade level texts. Read 180 and System 44 are both research 
based programs that have proven results with students with disabilities as well as English Language Learners. In order to 
further the academic and linguistic progress of ELL-SWD’s we have an IEP Coordinator who is a highly experience special 
education teacher. She is charged with ensuring that IEP’s are current and that students are appropriately placed, instructed, 
and accommodated during assessments. She engages in on-going communication with parents and all pedagogical staff 
members to ensure that needs are met. She is charged with collaborating weekly with the guidance counselors and 
programmer to ensure that student academic progress is monitored and that student programs comply with IEP mandates. 
She communicates regularly with related service providers to ensure that the social/behavioral needs o students are being 
appropriately addressed and that IEP goals are being met. The creation of this position and the on-going collaboration 
between aforementioned staff members allows for timely appraisal of student progress and/or modification of 
program/implementation of additional supports.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The school designs its program in order to allow all SWD students to be in the least restrictive environment. Because many of 
our ELL students are also classified SWD, we program so that core content classes do not conflict with the students’ ESL class. 
All ELL SWD students have full access to our ESL and Special Education services as well as our wide range of elective courses 
and after school programs. Teachers are assigned a common professional period for the sole purpose of engaging in inquiry 
and data analysis. During this time, teachers are expected to not only examine the data from their own courses, but to also 
engage in inquiry within their respective departments and grade levels. The goal of this work is to identify common issues and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

develop common strategies to align the work individual teachers are engaging in and to better support student needs in light 
of the mandates set forth by Regents exams and the rigors of the content areas. A large portion of our ELL-SWD’s have been 
placed in CTT or SETTS as per incoming Grade 8 IEP information, teacher recommendation and/or students’ demonstrated 
academic ability. Physical education and elective classes are open to all students regardless of placement.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our tutoring and scheduled intervention programs meet during period   Students who are specifically targeted to attend these 
scheduled intervention programs in ELA, math, Social studies and science are newcomers, long-term ELLs and SIFE students. 
These sessions take place during lunch (period 4), after-school and on Saturdays.  These subgroups typically need this 
additional support in order to acquire the Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) necessary to meet all graduation 
requirements and reach proficiency on the NYSESLAT. Teachers who have these designated times available are able to meet 
with students individually or in organized groups developed according to the needs of the students. Additionally, the ENL 
curriculum is content based and Common Core aligned, providing additional support for ELLs who struggle to gain CALP.  
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

One program we have evaluated and decided to implement is the System 44 and Read 180 program for entering and emerging 
ENL classes. Both are Common Core aligned and designed to meet the needs of struggling readers. Based on our 2013 
NYSESLAT data, our students have, by in large, attained proficiency in speaking and listening, but not reading and writing. 
Because of his data, our focus is now to push students’ growth in reading and writing. System 44 is used with our preliterate 
students to help them learn how to decode the 44 sounds of the English language. Once students are able to break the code, 
Read 180 works to improve their reading comprehension skills in the content areas.  
    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs or ELL services have been discontinued.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
BLCS has a rigorous content-based curriculum in which students are engaged in intermediate and advanced level classes in all 
subject areas. Students also have the opportunity to participate in several law-related electives. All students are given the 
opportunity to participate in tutoring and additional academic support classes, including coursework designed specifically to 
address preparation for Regents exams, during and after their regularly scheduled day. All students have the opportunity to 
participate in after school enrichment and recreational activities such as the Multicultural Club, a music program, flag football, 
basketball, mock trial and moot court. We view students’ participation in these activities as a means by which to further their 
personal interests, improve their attendance and engage in activities that require the use and application of language skills.  
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All ELL students receive services in the general education setting in heterogeneous classes. Classrooms are equipped with 
Promethean boards, LCD projectors and media carts. In order to enhance classroom content, programs such as Read 180 and 
System 44 are used in the ESL classroom. At BLCS we have found that a range of technology and a myriad of software allows 
for greater flexibility to address the individual needs of students, particularly our ELL population. The existence of one 
hetergenous ENL class, several intergrated classes, supplemental resources for ENL and content area teachers and a 
professional development library designed to meet the needs of our teaching staff further supports our ELL population.  
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

All home language supports are organized and developed by the ENL teachers and our learning support organization, New 
Visions. Teachers are offered multiple resources to supplement their instruction, which includes but is not limited to bilingual 
dictionaries, audio texts, video components to assist in the conveyance of concepts, dual language and modified texts.  A 
literacy coach has been hired and given a schedule that allows her to visit and support teachers of ELLs in content area 
classrooms. Additonally, both System 44 and Read 180 software has native language support built into the software. It can be 
turned on or off depending on student need.  
  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required services, supports and resources are aligned with student grade levels and ages. Pedagogical staff and 
administration work together to examine materials to ensure that the materials procured for use by ELLs is consistent with the 
level of rigor found in standard materials. The primary concern is for content to be accessible and presented in multiple 
modalities to address student learning styles and language strengths.  
  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
All ELL students receive services in the general education setting in heterogeneous classes. Classrooms are equipped with 
Promethean boards, LCD projectors and media carts. In order to enhance classroom content, programs such as Read 180 and 
System 44 are used in the ESL classroom. At BLCS we have found that a range of technology and a myriad of software allows 
for greater flexibility to address the individual needs of students, particularly our ELL population. The existence of one 
hetergenous ENL class, several intergrated classes, supplemental resources for ENL and content area teachers and a 
professional development library designed to meet the needs of our teaching staff further supports our ELL population.  
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We hold a series of Parent Orientations and case conference with students, both individually and as a group. Once a student 
is programmed, he or she quickly becomes acquainted with the school by receiving an introduction, a campus tour, and a 
meeting with his or her teachers. In the fall and the beginning of spring term, a session is devoted to developing students’ 
understanding of their programs and graduation requirements. Any student who enters during the time period between these 
sessions will receive this session individually. We have established a Summer Bridge Program that is open to all new incoming 
students. During the course of this program, students are scheduled to take an ELA and mathematics course to allow students 
to familiarize themselves with the 
expectations the high school classroom will put before them, to familiarize themselves with staff and their new environment 
and to allow teacher to gather data and a better understanding of strengths and weaknesses of incoming students, particularly 
SWD’s and ELL’s.  
  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

BLCS offers Spanish and Home Language Arts. ELL students are free to take part in any of the language electives offered.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All weekly professional development opportunities at Bronx High School for Law and Community Service require the 
participation and attendance of assistant principals, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, social workers, 
occupational/physical therapists, speech therapists, secretaries, and the parent coordinator. Professional development is 
provided by school staff and support organizations such as New Visions Each teacher has an individualized professional 
development plan based on initial observations using the new Danielson rating system. Based on individual teacher needs as 
well as school wide instructional needs, professional development sessions are differentiated.   Each Wednesday is a 
shortened day for students giving all staff the opportunity to meet for an hour of focused PD according to their 
PDP.   Additionally, the first week of school is dedicated to full-day professional development for staff.   
  
Our math and literacy coaches attend training in the Common Core Learning Standards once a month. Each month they 
come back and turn key what they have learned to the rest of the staff via small group departmental meetings and inquiry 
work. ENL teachers are included in the ELA and Math turnkey sessions, so that they are ready to support ELLs language 
acquisition in all content areas.  
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The first week of school is dedicated to full-day professional development for staff.  During that time, content- area teachers 
have time to co-plan with ENL teachers based on best practices shared by ENL teachers.  Additionally, department and grade 
teams meet weekly to co-plan with ENL teachers integrating best ENL practices into all lesson plans.   
  
The minimum requirements are met as described in question #1.  The assistant principal will keep track of these records.   
  
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Every September, ELL parents are invited to meet with the assistant principal, parent coordinator, ENL teacher and guidance 
counselor to review their language development progress, NYSESLAT results and content-area language development needs.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

All parents are encouraged to attend our monthly School Leadership Team and Parent Association meetings. We ensure that 
outreach for these meetings is done in the family’s native language. In order to increase attendance of ELL parents at school 
conferences, and other school events, we have increased the use of the school’s automated phone 
messaging service and one-on-one phone calls from our parent coordinator. Parent(s)/Guardians(s) of ELL’s are invited to our 
semi-annual (September and February) ELL Parent Meeting wherein parental roles and rights are discussed as well as the 
mandates set forth by the State of New York including ENL instruction, the NYSESLAT exam and the accommodations students 
are

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Michael Barakat, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Our school uses disaggregated data from ATS to monitor the ethnicity of our population. Data is also collected via 
the HLIS for new entrants to NYCDOE, or students returning to NYCDOE schools. Preferred language of 
communication We interview each family and their needs are determined. Many staff members are 
proficient/fluent in secondary and tertiary languages. Based upon interview conducted by the administration, 
guidance counselors, the community assistant, parent coordinator, and attendance teacher. Our findings indicate 
that there is a significant non-English speaking parent/guardian population many of whom are recent arrivals to 
the United States. Parent/guardian inclusionary events such as morning and evening Parent Association meetings 
and mlutlilingal parent- teacher conferences. Bilingual community assistant and parent coodinator. We use the 
ATS Report of Preferred Languages, data from the blue cards and parent surveys to assess the needs of our 
parents.

a school emergency.  
 

Oral interpretation services are used to meet the needs of our 186 parents who speak a language other than English 
at home. These services are provided by our administration, guidance counselors, community assistant, parent 
coordinator and attendance teacher. Staff members are ready to translate information and answer questions 
throughout the school day and at all school functions. Phone masters are programmed to send in parent's preferred 
language.

what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

The Translation and Interpretation Unit provides periodic training to parent coordinators on the language access 
requirements and on resources available to support these requirements. These trainings will be turn-keyed to staff 
members.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Our school is responsible for providing each parent whose primary language is a covered language and who require 
language assistance services with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities which includes their rights 
regarding translation and interpretation services. This copy will be provided at orientation, mailed home and 
distributed during parent/teacher conferences.  

Our school will also post a sign in each of the covered languages, or most prominent covered languages, indicating the 
availability of interpretation services.
