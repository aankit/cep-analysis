Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our school's Mission Statement is, as follows: The mission of P.S./M.S. 206 is to deliver quality instruction to all 
students. Staff, parents, and community will create an environment that maximizes the unique needs, interests, and 
abilities of each child. We will strive to enhance each child's physical, intellectual, emotional, and social growth. We 
envision our students becoming responsible thinkers and productive members of society. Together we strive to 
achieve success for all children.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Jose Celso Barbosa School is an elementary-middle school with 488 students from grade 3 through grade 8. The 
school population comprises 27% Black, 64% Hispanic, 5% White, and 2% Asian, and 2% other. The student body 
includes 14% English language learners and 39% special education students. Boys account for 56% of the students 
enrolled and girls account for 44%. The number of students eligible for free meals (HRA) is 365; the number eligible 
for free meal (no form) is 10; the number of students eligible for reduced price meal is 1; the number of students 
eligible for full price meal is 2; the number of students eligible for full price meal (missing form) is 0; the number 
eligible for full price meal (no form) is 103. 

ATS attendance data reflects an annual attendance average of 93.5% for 2017-2018. 

The 2017-2018 ATS report on Temporary Housing reflects: 22 students in shelters; 40 students doubled up; 5 students 
in other temporary living situation; and 3 students in permanent housing status. 

Our overall student population continues to increase, with students and families choosing to remain at our school as 
the children age into adolescence and select us as a desirable middle school option. Our middle school has added a 
grade each year since its inception; we are at full implementation (grades 3-8) and continue to grow, even increasing 
our incoming students. This continuing trend represents a strong indication that we must continue to nurture and 
promote our school as one that will be desirable for teenagers and their families and one that will be successful, as 
measured by our students’ perceptions and successes. 

P.S./M.S.206 will share the school’s complex with only one other school – the tandem early childhood school, P.S. 
112, having shared the building with two schools in the past. The children enter PS/MS 206 in the third grade and we 
now have a full middle school with 6 th, 7 th and 8 th grades. PS/MS 206 continues to reach out to involve parents 
and families to build and maintain strong school-family-community links through ongoing communication and 
meaningful, relevant activities, such as parent workshops to help parents navigate any and all resources for parents. 

Our school’s Leadership Team and Parent Teacher Association are fully operational and our Parent Coordinator works 
with families, as needed. We have dedicated financial and human resources to funding for SAVE room teacher and a 
dean to provide in-school guidance support for our students, our belief and commitment to social-emotional well-
being of our students, many of whom face daunting life challenges, is for us, the right thing to do to help our children. 
We also understand the need to prepare our students for college and career readiness and for their success in the 
21st century. Our Smart Boards in the classrooms are utilized not only to motivate students but provide access to 
current information that standard textbooks cannot possibly do. Smart Board professional training for teachers is 
provided for teachers so that they can continually increase their own capacity to use this technology in innovative and 
effective ways. P.S. 206 is committed to the effective development of well-rounded, competent, and secure children, 
whose social-emotional growth supports their academic achievement. 

We are very proud of the many partnerships and services they provide to help us support the whole child and address 
the complex and multi-faceted processes of raising physically, socially, emotionally, and academically successful 
children. The following are some of our highlighted programs: NEST Program, City Year, Wediko, Dancing in the 
Classrooms, Studio in a School, Salvation Army, NYU, Hunter College, Videoconferencing, Bronx Arts Ensemble, 
Teachers College. These established partnerships collaboratively support our school, students, families, and staff’s 
needs and we continue to engage our efforts to build new partnerships, while continuing the valuable ones already in 
place.

Our school’s accountability status continues to be designated as Good Standing, as determined by the New York State 
Department of Education under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESSA) Flexibility Waiver. 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We do not yet have the official statistics to document our current chronic absentee percentage for this year. Although 
our overall student attendance rate is approximately 94%, it is critical that we focus strategic attention to ensure that 
our students (and their families) who are identified as chronic absentees receive the appropriate supports and 
guidance to ensure that their attendance and punctuality rates improve dramatically. Many of our students and their 
families struggle with the myriad problems and challenges of poverty, poor health (physical, emotional, mental), and 
disenfranchisement. 

Other areas of need that relate to the students' chronic absences and challenges that they and their families face due 
to poverty, poor health, and sense of disenfranchisement are a focus for our school's continuing, collaborative efforts 
with community-based organizations that support our school guidance personnel in helping the students and their 
families secure appropriate services by navigating the system with them and following up on impact/outcomes and 
results. While we have experienced and talented guidance and support personnel, the large number of children and 
families who need support services will be best served by merging our own service with that of the outside agencies 
and organizations that work with us, in concert, for the shared goal.  

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide , in response to questions and prompts related to Collaborative 
Teachers, the school was rated 3.67, which was +0.19 higher than the district average and equal to the citywide 
average. Other significant information from this same data source reflects the following: 

"99% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that they are able to modify instructional activities and materials to meet 
the development needs and learning interests of their students." (Q2c) This response is 5 % higher than the district 
average and 4% higher than the city average. 

"95% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that they are able to design appropriate instruction that is matched to 
students' need (e.g., English language learners (ELL) proficiency and students with disabilities." 

"100% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that they are able to distinguish linguistic/cultural differences from 
learning disabilities," reflecting an increase from last year's responses of 91%. (Q2e) This response is 9 % higher than 
the district average and 8% higher than the city average.  

These responses are important since the special student populations require all staff members to continually upgrade 
their instructional practices to meet the diverse needs of the students.  

We currently have 58 English language learners and 40% students with disabilities. Of that 40%, 13% are students in 
the NEST program, as students on the Autism spectrum. We are organizing the school for 28 classes to meet the 
needs of our special education students. Three of those classes will be self-contained and all the others will be 
Integrated Co-Teaching classrooms.  

We are also organizing for 4 Dual Language NEST classes and 4 Dual Language ICT classes (one of each for each grade 
level (grades 3-6). 

Based on the NYSESLAT data (2017-2018), the following reflects the breakdown of our ELL students' language 
proficiency levels: Commanding-9; Expanding-36; Transitioning-9; Emerging-4; Entering-1 (total 58 ELLs). 

Given the teachers' Effective and Highly Effective Advance ratings from the Advance Dashboard, 2017-2018, in 
components 1e and 3c, it is expected that the appropriate supports, scaffolds, and extensions will be included in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

teachers' collaborative teacher team planning to continue to ensure that all students, including the special 
populations, will be tracked and monitored throughout the year on a frequent basis, to ensure that they are 
progressing towards meeting New York State proficiency levels in ELA, Math, and language, as applicable.  

Since some of our students face multiple challenges of learning disability, coupled with language challenges, it is very 
important that our teachers and staff become even more adept at recognizing linguistic challenges from learning 
disabilities. The professional development need for this aspect of instruction is important for us, as a school, as 54% of 
our total student population is presenting with learning challenges.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The element of the Framework for Great Schools in which our school made the most progress over the past year was 
that of Effective School Leadership. A review and analysis of teachers’ ratings for 2017-2018, through our Measures of 
Teacher Practice Data Tracker, reflects that the overwhelming majority of teachers are performing in the Effective 
range.  

Professional Development opportunities have been provided through a wide range of forums and related to diverse 
content. Teachers have provided input and voice into their own professional needs through recommendations to the 
school’s Staff Development Committee; Teacher Teams; teacher reflection forms and questionnaires; and through 
ongoing, informal professional conversations. 

The element of the Framework for Great Schools in which our school will focus for 2018-2019 will continue to be 
Rigorous Instruction. 

Considering the compelling research about the significance of effective higher order thinking questions and the value 
of discussion in the classroom, correlating to improved student outcomes, and in consideration of supervisory 
observations and teachers’ ratings this year, which highlighted teachers’ strengths and areas of need, it is determined 
that our school’s instructional focus for 2018-2019 will continue to be Questioning and Discussion Techniques 
(Danielson Framework for Teaching component 3b). We will also focus on Student Engagement (Danielson 
Framework for Teaching component 3c), to deepen and expand the teachers’ classroom practices, leading to 
improved student progress and performance. Based on feedback from Superintendent and Principal Leadership 
Facilitator, in the PPOs conducted during school year (2017-2018), we are adding an emphasis on Assessment and 
Feedback to Students (Danielson Framework for Teaching component 3d) to ensure that students receive clear and 
actionable feedback to continuously improve their work products.  

We will continue to provide extensive and differentiated professional development for teachers and 
paraprofessionals in these critical aspects of instruction and understand how continuing this work will strengthen 
pedagogical practices to yield improved student outcomes. We will continue to deepen our use of data, and 
specifically data pertaining to our ENL subgroup population, such as NYSESLAT, to plan for and implement appropriate 
and precise differentiated strategies, supports, scaffolds, and extensions for ELLs, in consideration of their language 
proficiency levels and language strand needs. 

While these instructional foci will figure prominently in our emphasis, we will use these components to serve as 
supports and scaffolding leading to robust and rigorous student writing, as evidence of the higher-order thinking and 
rich discussions. Our school-wide, Rigorous Instruction writing goal, within the Framework for Great Schools element 
of Rigorous Instruction, will be in alignment with District 4 Goals and Initiatives.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
According to the School Quality Guide (2017-2018), related to Rigorous Instruction, the Framework element score is 
3.22, reflecting a slight decrease from last year's score of 3.25. 

According to the School Quality Guide (2017-2018), related to Rigorous Instruction, the Survey element score is 2.38, 
reflecting a decrease from last year's score of 2.51. 

A review and analysis of NYSESLAT data (2017-2018), using the RLAT Report from ATS, reveals that 9 of our students 
tested out with Commanding scores. Based on the NYSESLAT data (2017-2018), the following reflects the breakdown 
of our ELL students' language proficiency levels: Commanding-9; Expanding-36; Transitioning-9; Emerging-4; Entering-
1 (total 58 ELLs). 

Using this data will drive our differentiated ENL instruction and our targets of measurement. The writing strand on the 
exam still remains the lowest score out of the four NYSESLAT language strands for all students. This result drives our 
clear and determined focus to highlight and emphasize improved student writing. In alignment with District 4's writing 
initiative this year, our school will prioritize the improvement of writing, as our rigorous instruction goal identifies. 

The priority need for this Capacity Framework Element is to provide consistent instruction, across the school, that is 
customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core; to ensure that high standards are established and 
maintained in every classroom; to ensure that all students are actively engaged in challenging intellectual activity and 
tasks to develop critical thinking habits and skills. 

The New York State spring 2018 ELA exam Met/Not Met results reflect the following percentages, compared to the 
spring 2017 ELA exam Met/Not Met results:

3-15 students; Level 4-2 students. 41% of the 8th graders are on Levels 3 and 4. 

The Superintendent’s recommendation from the March 21, 2018 PPO, evaluated QR Component 2.2 as Developing 
and cited as next steps, "Continue to build teachers' 'tool box' of assessment skills, analysis proficiencies, gathering 
strategies, and providing students with actionable feedback via professional learning opportunities, modeling, and 
coaching. Additionally, as the school leader continues to lead staff to enhance the alignment of the assessments to 
the curricula and instruction, provide explicit support to staff regarding your expectations for their tools for record-
keeping of gathered data, such as conferring, checking for understanding, and in-the-moment instructional 
adjustments, based on the data, to effectively meet the needs of all students. Support teacher leaders and teachers in 
providing actionable and meaningful feedback to students, so that scholars have clarity around and can implement 
next steps. Further, support staff to memorialize the adjustments to curricula and instruction, ensuring that the data 
cycle of re-plan, re-teach, and re-assess is available for future planning and to demonstrate student progress towards 
goals. (QR 2.2)." 

In the October 11, 2017 PPO, the Principal Leadership Facilitator evaluated QR Component 2.2 as Developing and 
cited as next steps, “Ensure that assessments are aligned with curricula and that students are provided actionable 
feedback with clear next steps. Teacher assessment practices should reflect ongoing progress monitoring and, based 
on the data, making adjustments to effectively meet the needs of all students." (QR 2.2)

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By February 2019, as a result of all teacher teams collaborating to focus on students’ improved volume and quality of 
writing in all classes, 50% of students will increase their volume and quality of writing in ELA and across content areas, 
as measured by an improvement in at least 2 criteria of an CCLS-aligned rubrics and mid-year MOSL writing 
performance assessment, compared to a baseline MOSL writing performance assessment. 

A review of pre and mid year ELA MOSL results reflects the following data: 

3rd grade: 56 students improved out of 70 students with scores to compare 

4th grade: 60 students improved out of 67 students with scores to compare 

5th grade: 43 students improved out of 76 students with scores to compare 

6th grade: 36 students improved out of 65 students with scores to compare 

7th grade: 49 students improved out of 58 students with scores to compare 

8th grade: 25 students improved out of 45 students with scores to compare 

Overall, the school-wide improvement in ELA MOSL performance was 70.6% for general education students. 

When calculating the scores for special education students in self-contained classes, the results decreased slightly to 
70% overall. 

We have met our February 2019 progress monitoring goal of at least 50% of students improving in at least 2 criteria 
of an CCLS-aligned rubrics and mid-year MOSL writing performance assessment, compared to a baseline MOSL 
writing performance assessment. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
The instrument of measure that will be used to assess progress will be the CCLS-aligned rubrics and mid-year MOSL 
writing performance assessment 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
According to the School Quality Guide (2017-2018), related to Supportive Environment, the Framework element score 
is not available, as of now. 

According to the School Quality Guide (2017-2018), related to Supportive Environment, the Survey element score is 
2.36, reflecting a decrease from last year's score of 3.06. 

According to the 2017-2018 School Survey,  

Teachers' responses reflected that 57% agree or strongly agree that their students were safe outside the school while 
94% agree or strongly agree that students are safe in their classes.  

Students' responses to the same prompts revealed the following results: "78% agree or strongly agree that they feel 
safe outside the school while 82% of the students agree or strongly agree that they feel safe in their classes. 

Parents responded that 96% agree or strongly agree that the school is safe. 

By February 2018, a review of OORS reports on suspensions and incidents revealed that: 

there were 79 suspensions and incidents, as reported in OORS between September 2016 and January 2017 

there were 129 suspensions and incidents, as reported in OORS between September 2017 and January 2018 

We had not met the February progress monitoring goal of 5% decrease in suspensions and incidents. 

A review of OORS from September 2017 to June 2018 revealed that: 

there were 206 suspensions and incidents, as reported in OORS between September 2017 and June 2018  

there were 138 suspensions and incidents, as reported in OORS between September 2016 and June 2017  

there were 68 more suspensions and incidents this year, compared to the previous year, 

The priority need for this Capacity Framework Element is to ensure that classrooms and school culture are established 
so that students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

The Superintendent’s recommendation from the March 21, 2018 PPO, evaluated QR Component 1.4 as Highly 
Effective and cited as commendation, "The school wide inclusive culture is informed by the theory of action and

results in a safe environment that supports students' progress towards goals. Students are well-known by at least one 
adult, who provides social-emotional support and personalize other supports. To ensure that staff and families have 
professional development to result in the adoption of effective academic and personal behaviors. Through a culture 
of consistent positive attitudes and celebrations, the staff promotes a supportive and trusted environment. Continue 
to expand students' academic and social-emotional learning through programs such as NEST program, City Year, and 
Dancing in the Classrooms. (QR 1.4)." 

In the October 11, 2017 PPO, the Principal Leadership Facilitator evaluated QR Component 1.4 as Highly Effective and 
cited as commendation, "The school leader continues to approach culture building, discipline, and social-emotional 
support results in a safe environment and with an inclusive culture. Leadership has established a culture of mutual 
trust and positive attitudes through the use of school wide communications and celebrations that promote 
community and high impact partnerships with families, such as student of the month. Structures are in place so that 
each student is well known by adults who help to personalize supports and school strategically aligns professional 
development that results in academic and personal behaviors. The leader continues to further enhance the academic 
and personal growth through programs such as NEST program, City Year and Dancing in the Classrooms. (QR 1.4)."  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of students will participate in and benefit from programs and activities, i.e., PBIS (Positive 
behavior Intervention System); Wediko, and the ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) Nest program that support their 
social and emotional well-being and prepare them for college and career, as measured by a 10% decrease in the 
number of suspensions/incidents in the 2018- 2019 OORS Report, as compared to the number of 
suspensions/incidents in the 2017-2018 OORS Report.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By February 2019, 50% of students will participate and benefit from programs and activities, i.e., PBIS (Positive 
behavior Intervention System); Wediko, and the ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) Nest program that support their 
social and emotional well-being and prepare them for college and career, as measured by a 5 % decrease in the

from September 2017-January 2018 with the mid-year OORS Report data covering September 2018-January 2019.  

A review of OORS reports data between September 2017 to January 2018 and September 2018 to January 2019 
reflects the following: 

In September 2017 to January 2018, there were 129 incidents and suspensions. In September 2018 to January 2019, 
there were 84 incidents and suspensions. There was a total of 45 fewer incidents and suspensions, when comparing 
the data between these two time periods. There was a 35% decrease in incidents and suspensions. 

We exceeded our February 2019 progress monitoring goal of a 5% decrease in incidents and suspensions.

Summary Findings  

In 2017-2018, 

 

In all 8 components, an overwhelming number of teachers remained at the same level of performance, 
compared to their scores from the previous year. 

  There was a significant increase in the number of teachers who stayed at the same level of performance, 

 

 

compared to their scores from the previous year. 
In all components (except 4e), there was a decrease in the number of teachers who improved their level of 
performance, compared to their scores from last year.  
For component 4e, the same number of teachers improved their level of performance, compared to their 
scores from last year. 

  The components in which there was the greatest decline in teachers’ improving their level of performance 

were 2a and 2d (Domain 2- classroom environment). 

Implications for Next Steps 

 

School leaders need to ensure (plan and monitor) ongoing, rigorous and targeted professional development, 
according to teachers’ needs and strengths. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

 

 

School leaders need to provide frequent, rigorous, and targeted monitoring of teachers’ instructional planning 
and delivery, through review of unit and lesson plans and classroom observations, with quality feedback to 
teachers to improve their practices. 
School leaders should leverage the strong instructional planning and implementation of teachers who 
received Effective and/or Highly Effective ratings for the mentoring and professional development 
opportunities of their colleagues. 

  The school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan will include action plan goals, objectives, and action plans that 

reflect the data presented in these findings. 

The priority needs for this Capacity Framework Element are to nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff; 
to develop and deliver instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 

In the PPO, dated October 11, 2017, the Principal Leadership Facilitator evaluated QR Indicator 1.2 as Effective and 
cited as next steps, “Develop a capacity building plan with the focus on improving teacher instructional practice. 
Continue to enhance the pedagogical practices by, including questioning, scaffolds in English and/or native language, 
provision of multiple entry points and higher order thinking skills so that all students are appropriately engaged in 
challenging tasks around rigorous engagement and facilitation of student learning with an eye towards strengthening 
student question development through the Socratic Seminar and Readers Theater practices. This will also help to 
elevate higher order thinking and the level of challenge the tasks provide. With fidelity, look to monitor and 
document through Advance that pedagogical practices be driven by rigorous instructional and learning opportunities 
that lead to cognitive engagement and discussion that will foster greater student collaboration across all classrooms. 
Provide pedagogical practice support to the faculty to ensure that the needs of all learners are met through a variety 
of strategies with continuous feedback and next steps. (QR 1.2)”  

In the PPO, dated March 21, 2018, the Superintendent evaluated QR Indicator 1.2 as Effective and cited as 
recommendation, “The school wide beliefs of how students learn best are not only articulated and aligned to the 
curricula, but also in evidence across classrooms as these beliefs are also aligned to the Danielson Framework for 
Teaching. Multiple entry points provide access to the curricula and tasks for students. Mostly students are engaged in 
tasks with higher-order thinking prompts and discussions. Although students are challenged with a level of rigor, 
those tasks could be further developed to provide improved student work products and discussions. (QR 1.2)." 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, as a result of 100% of teachers planning for and implementing at least 2 divergent questions and 
incorporating rigorous student to student discussion opportunities; and providing effective feedback to students, on a

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By February 2019, as a result of 100% of teachers planning for and implementing at least 2 divergent questions; 
incorporating rigorous student to student discussion opportunities; and providing effective feedback to students, on a 
daily basis, 50% of teachers will receive Effective and/or Highly Effective MOTP ratings in Advance, components 3b, 
3c, and 3d. 

A review of the Advance Teacher level MOTP Detail report from September 2018 through January 20198 reflects the 
following results: 

Out of 60 teachers, 1 teacher received at least 1 rating of Highly Effective in component 3b and 48 teachers received 
at least 1 rating of Effective in component 3b (49 teachers out of 60 teachers received at least 1 rating of Effective or 
Highly Effective in component 3b-81.6%). 

Out of 60 teachers, no teacher received a rating of Highly Effective in component 3c and 30 teachers received at least 
1 rating of Effective in component 3c (30 teachers out of 60 teachers received at least 1 rating of Effective in 
component 3c-50%). 

Out of 60 teachers, no teacher received a rating of Highly Effective in component 3d and 58 teachers received at least 
1 rating of Effective in component 3c (58 teachers out of 60 teachers received at least 1 rating of Effective in 
component 3d-96.6%). 

Based on this data, we have exceeded the February 2019 progress monitoring goal of at least 50% of teachers 
receiving ratings of Effective and/or Highly Effective in components 3b, 3c, and 3d between September 2018 and 
February 2019.  

 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
 The Advance Dashboard will be used to assess progress of the number of teachers who receive Effective and/or 
Highly Effective ratings in Advance, components 3b, 3c, and 3d. 

 

Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By February 2019, all staff will demonstrate progress towards increasing the level of parental involvement in our 
school, as measured by a 25% increase in attendance at monthly events (PTA meetings, parent teacher conferences, 
workshops, etc.), when compared to the level of parental involvement during the 2017-2018 school year, between 
September and February, as measured by the Parent Coordinator Activity Report (PCAR). 

A review of PTA meetings reflects the following data: 

From September 2017 to January 2018, there were 5 PTA meetings, in which 53 parents attended. From September 
2018 to January 2019, there were 4 PTA meetings, in which 32 parents attended (one meeting had to be cancelled 
due to circumstances beyond the school's control).  

A review of the PCAR entry data reflects the following: 

From September 2017 to January 2018, there were 5 parent workshops , in which 53 parents attended. From 
September 2018 to January 2019, there were 23 PTA meetings, in which 387 parents attended. 

A review of the Parent Teacher Conferences reflects the following: 

From September 2017 to January 2018, there were 646 parents in attendance. From September 2018 to January 
2019, there were 503 parents in attendance.  

 

In total, the number of parents in attendance at school meetings, conferences, and workshops during September 
2017 to January 2018 was 752. 

In total, the number of parents in attendance at school meetings, conferences, and workshops during September 
2018 to January 2019 was 922.  

This reflects an increase of 170 more parents attending school-wide events between the same period (September 
2017 to January 2018 and September 2018 to January 2019).  

Although there was an increase in parent attendance, we did not meet our February 2019 progress monitoring goal of 
25%, which would have been an increase of 188 parents). We reached 22% increase (170 more parents).

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Recruitment: 

We begin interviewing potential teachers for anticipated vacancies beginning in January.  

We post positions on New Teacher Finder and review applications to do outreach to candidates whose 
experiences/education would support our school's needs and mission/vision. 

We have developed professional relationships with Teachers College, NYU, Hunter College, and Teaching Fellows 
program. Their student teachers work in our school throughout the school year and this provides us with a potential 
pool of teachers from which we can hire for the upcoming school year.  

We make potential candidates aware of the professional development, mentoring, and supports for staff that are 
offered at the school during our interview process.  

We include current teachers in the interview process to maximize multiple perspectives about the candidates. 

Candidates conduct demonstration lessons and participate in debriefing sessions with interview committee of 
teachers and school leaders.  

 

Assignments: 

Teacher assignments are made in collaboration between teachers and school leaders to ensure the best alignment 
between teachers' strengths and students' needs. Teachers submit preference sheets in the spring and conversations 
between teachers and the principal focus on confirming such preferences or alternative placements. Integrated 
Collaborative Teaching (ICT) class placements are made in consideration of the blending of the teachers' strengths 
and needs, as partners in the team teaching environment.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

Retention and Professional Support: 

In order to ensure that we retain high-quality teachers, we implement intentional practices and supports, as follows: 

We include current staff in interview panels and observation of demonstrations lessons so that current staff members 
are invested in support and development of new staff. 

We make thoughtful decisions about pairing new teachers with supportive school-based mentors. 

We provide regular, ongoing year-long mentors and professional development opportunities for teachers. 

Teachers attend Professional Development sessions provided by the District, i.e. Special Education workshops; ELL 
workshops; City-wide workshops. 

We provide differentiated PD for new teachers (in content areas and procedural matters) and PD consultants, 

Special Ed. District Staff and ASD Cluster/Coach that supports the ICT partnerships and new special education 
teachers. 

We provide opportunities for teachers to assume leadership roles, such as teacher team facilitators, model teachers, 
etc. 

We acknowledge teachers' professional contributions with positive letters of recognition and commendation.  

The AIS reading teacher and literacy coach provides support in the area of common core standards; lesson planning 
and the Danielson rubric. 

We use the professional text, First Days of School by Wong & Wong, as a professional resource. 

Other high-quality, research-based professional texts are distributed to all staff and are used throughout the year to 
support the school's instructional initiatives.  

 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development

Teachers collaborate on grade-level teacher teams to analyze student work and during these sessions, they learn from 
each other, as they identify students' strengths, areas of need, discuss potential feedback to students and determine 
next instructional steps. Mentors and consultants also meet with teachers in small groups or in one-on-one meetings 
to deepen the teachers' skills in analyzing student work and determine feedback and next instructional steps. 

The principal attends professional development provided by Teachers College. The principal participates in Algebra for 
All PD sessions from DOE. The principal participates in the Learning Partners Program. The assistant principal will be 
participating in CSA's Executive Leadership Institute workshops and mentoring program. She will also be participating 
in the district's Learning Partners Program, and English Language Learners PD, offered by the district.  

Paraprofessionals will be attending professional development sessions that the city and district will be providing to 
specifically meet the needs of paraprofessionals to maximize their effectiveness in the classroom. Lead paras will then 
turnkey their learning and information with other paraprofessionals on staff.

The Principal formed a MOSL Committee in the Spring 2014, in collaboration with the UFT Chapter Chairperson, in 

accordance with the guidelines of the ADVANCE Evaluation System. The Principal selected members and the UFT 
Chapter Chairperson also selected members for the committee. The committee meets at least 6-8 times, during the 
year in preparation for the following year. 

They had the opportunity to view and discuss the available powerpoint presentations and webinars. Every committee 
member was provided with the MOSL materials in a binder by the Principal. They reviewed the options and selected 
the state and local assessment measures, with the final decisions made by the Principal, who was in accordance with 
the teachers’ choices. 

The principal entered the options online in the appropriate DOE portal, by the designated deadline in September 2014 
and continues to adhere to all requirements related to MOSLs. 

 

Teachers collaborate on grade-level teacher teams to analyze student work. During these sessions, they share and 
learn from each other, as they identify students' strengths, areas of need, possible feedback, and next instructional 
steps. Mentors and consultants also meet with teachers in small groups or in one-on-one meetings to deepen the 
teachers' skills in analyzing students' work, determining effective feedback to students, and identifying next 
instructional steps.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent

representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S./M.S. 206 Jose Celso Barbosa , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title 
I, Part A of theEvery Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 
P.S./M.S. 206 Jose Celso Barbosa will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act. 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

including non-negotiables. 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

Teachers will meet with and/or communicate with parents and families during the weekly Tuesday Family 
Engagement time to provide suggestions for how parents can support their children at home; to provide current 
information about how the children are performing and progressing

P.S./M.S. 206M Jose Celso Barbosa is a 3rd-8th grade elementary and middle school located in 
East Harlem. The staff at P.S./M.S. 206M includes 3 certified ESL teachers and 6 certified 
bilingual teachers. According to the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) generated in December 
2017, the total student population was 479 students, 16.1% of which were English Language 
Learners (ELLs), including former ELLs. The home languages of the ELLs at P.S./M.S. 206M 
include Arabic, Bengali, French, Fulani, Haitian-Creole, Spanish, and Wolof. 
The target population of our Title III programming will be our population of long-term ELLs (7 
total students), as well as the ELLs who received 1-2s on the ELA 2018 exam or ELLs deemed 
“at risk”. The program will support student development in all of the four language modalities - 
Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking - but will focus specifically on the Reading and Listening 
modalities. 
The anticipated dates of the program will be from October 2018 through May 2019, on 
Wednesdays and Thursdays for 1.5 hours from 2:30-4:00 PM. 
There will be 5 teachers receiving training and instructing classes of heterogeneous level 
groupings of ELLs, who will work for 3 hours weekly for 15 weeks. Two of the 5 teachers have 
an ENL license and the three others have a Bilingual Common Branch License. 
After analyzing the 2018 NYSESLAT scores and the ELA results, the data shows that ELLs at 
P.S./M.S. 206M, including our long-term ELLs, need additional instruction in their Reading and 
Writing as well as continued work in Listening. Of the four modalities, ELLs perform the highest 
in Speaking. In order to address these needs, the Title III after school program will implement 
the following: 
Third and 4th grade ELL students will participate in an inter-cultural after school program. The 
students will meet once a week and create weekly video segments that will be emailed to another 
school in Armenia, Colombia. The students in that school, the GI School, are Colombian but 
learn English in their school. They will then create a video and email it back to us. Each week 
will have a different theme that will be addressed in our video. Three modalities will be used 
towards this purpose; speaking, writing and listening. For example, our students will discuss the 
theme for that week. They will then script what they would like to tell the students in the other 
school. Next, they will workshop it in a small group and practice reading it. Finally, we will film 
the students and pose a question to the other school to address in their video. At the next meeting 
we would watch the video that the other school sent to us. The students would have a discussion 
based on the findings in the video. They would then prepare their next video. Our students would 
also prepare a short presentation on their own heritage to share with the other school. To 
accomplish this they will research their heritage using parent/guardian interviews, library and 
internet research, and what they they already know. At the end of the program, parents will be 
invited to a potluck where students will share some of the videos that they made. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73 

 

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
 
Through this cultural exchange, our students would gain a deeper understanding of different 
facets of life in Colombia as well as practice different modalities using the English language. 
They will be both teachers and students as they demonstrate what they know about life in NYC 
and learn about life in another culture. Many ELLs in the 3rd and 4th grade need practice with 
listening and writing, as per the 2018 NYSESLAT scores, and this afterschool program will give 
them additional practice. 
 
Fifth and 6th grade students will participate in an after-school program that will focus on 
analyzing and interpreting historical events from various cultures with the goal of developing 
cultural awareness. Students will research these historic events by visiting the library and reading 
articles, books, and watching documentaries. They will then develop multiple skits and perform 
them to portray their interpretation of the historical cultural events of their choice. Their 
academic language will be enhanced when researching the various historical events and by 
incorporating content-specific vocabulary when developing their skits. Their skits will then be 
recorded and later displayed at a culminating gallery walk, which parents, staff, and fellow 
students will be invited to attend. Through these activities, students’ primary language focus will 
be the reading and writing modalities. As per their scores on the 2017, NYSESLAT, students 
have shown a need for greater support and development in these areas.   
 
Seventh and 8th grade ENL students will practice journalism and creative nonfiction storytelling 
through the use of digital media. Students will primarily use photography, video, music, and 
writing to develop content that documents community life in East Harlem and NYC. Students 
will regularly visit East Harlem landmarks, attend school and community events, and 
occasionally travel to other NYC sites to capture images and collect oral histories. They will then 
create video or photographic content that tells the story of these places and traditions and write 
accompanying descriptions and narratives. Student-produced content may be posted to the 
school’s website or social media. Students will practice academic language through the 
following structures and protocols: 
· 
· 
· 
· 
Researching the history of East Harlem, including specific locales (reading, listening) 
Developing narration and interview prompts (writing, speaking) 
Rehearsing interview and oral history collection practices (speaking, listening) 
Writing introductions and descriptions to accompany their image-based content (writing) 
The following academic language features will be targeted in these structures and protocols: 
·

Begin description here:            
A training group for staff delivering the Title III instruction and services to ELLs will be held for 
one hour per week for 10 weeks. These book studies will be based around chapters from 
following books “Culturally Responsive Design for English Learners” by Patti Kelly Ralabate 
and Loui Lord Nelson and “Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain” by Zaretta 
Hammond. 
These books describe the framework for culturally responsive teaching (CRT) and how it may 
effectively serve linguistically diverse students in their academic and social development. By 
participating in shared reading and discussion of the books’ content, teachers in this book study 
will build capacity to design curriculum and instruction that utilizes ELLs’ strengths while 
maintaining high level of rigor. Title III funds will not be used to purchase these texts; select 
chapters will be photocopied. The book study may use additional standalone texts that 
complement the investigation of CRT and its use for instructional design. 
In addition, the Title III program teachers will meet prior to the beginning of the program for a 
professional development workshop that familiarizes them with the program's curriculum. This 
workshop will explain the scope and sequence of the program. The workshop will also include 
close examination of available data, such as NYSESLAT scores, ELA scores, and/or student 
work, so that teachers involved in Title III teaching understand student strengths and areas for 
growth.

At P.S./M.S. 206M, we believe that parental involvement creates a stronger community of 
learners and we strive to incorporate parents into all parts of our students' learning. Parents will 
be invited to the school prior to the onset of the Title III program for an orientation to the 
program. They will learn what their students will do in the Title III program, as well as strategies 
they can use to help their child's English language development. Their training will specifically 
address strategies for supporting reading and writing work.  They will also be given information 
on the ENL programs available for parents throughout the city, including ENL classes for adults 
and programs hosted by the NYCDOE. Interpretation and translation will be provided to parents 
as needed. 
Throughout the duration of the program, parents will be invited to join their children on field 
trips to explore one or more of the topics covered in the elementary and middle school programs.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Families of middle school (7th and 8th grade) students will be invited to join trips to local 
Harlem landmarks. On these trips, family members will participate by assisting the students with 
photographing, filming, and interviewing the community members and landmarks. They will be 
provided with a description of overall goals and a checklist of tasks to be accomplished on this 
trip. 
 
 
Interpretation and translation will be provided to parents as needed. Teachers will communicate 
opportunities for family involvement using flyers, permission slips, phone calls, and the 
messaging platform on the program Jupiter Ed, which allows middle school family members to 
see students grades. Title III-related family meetings, events, and/or trainings will be held on the

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 
 
The formative assessments or   curriculum-embedded assessments being used to guide instructional planning   for our ELLs is 
as follows: 
•  Teachers   CollegeRunning Reading Record Assessment as utilized as part of the school   instructional targeted assessment. 
The results of this assessment are entered   into SchoolNet.com. Further literacy assessments are entered into   SchoolNet.com 
in February.  Also, the Teachers   College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) assessments give us the ability   to analyze 
student work to target the specific skills and needs of our ELLs   in reading and writing. After analysis, teachers are able to

confer and   develop lesson plans to target the needs of individual students as well as   note trends across the board with 
students and grade levels as a whole. At   professional development and teacher team meetings, an analysis of the   students' 
writing ability is conducted and ELLs are compared to their non-ELL   peers. 
•  ELLs   at PS/MS 206 are administered two periodic assessments to inform the   instruction for ELLs.   They are   assessed in 
the three modalities: reading, writing and listening. This   assessment is designed to measure students’ progress toward 
English   proficiency for students whose first language is not English.  The results of the assessments are entered   into 
SchoolNet.com. 
•  Teachers   create unit assessments at the end of the curricula units in all content   areas (ELA, Math, Social Studies and 
Science) are administered throughout the   year. 
 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

At PS/MS 206 the structures in place to support this effort is that all ELA and ENL teachers maintain a Running Record binder 
and teachers use shared Google documents to track running records results.  The objectives for using data is for teachers 
to  engage in quality professional learning, weekly, to ensure delivery of effective instruction for students, and to collect 
student data from several sources, such as responses on standardized tests, writing tasks, and other formative and summative 
assessments to meet weekly to analyze, interpret, and use the data to adjust instruction and plan lessons.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need 
are as follows: 
    The Dual Language Leadership team, content area teachers, certified bilingual and ENL teachers, use the ELL periodic 
assessments, (Fall & Winter), to evaluate the strengths and next steps of ELLs to prepare them for the NYSESLAT and ELA 
exams and test structures.  The NYSESLAT, ELA, and MOSL (Measure of Student Learning) in all content area exams help the 
school get a better idea how successful programs are and what are the areas of improvements.   
 
 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 The structures in place to address   interventions once the summative data has been gathered is as follows:   
• ENL   and Dual Language teachers meet weekly during teacher team meetings to   discuss students’ progress, and to address 
student needs and implement   academic interventions. In addition, grade level teams meet weekly to plan   and discuss Tier 1 
and 2 instruction.    During these weekly meetings teachers discuss the following: 
         1. Discuss strategies used and impact on   students’ performance 
        2.    Design units, lessons and assessments 
        3. Examine student work sample and   assessment in order to better understand students      
             strengths and weakness and   improve instruction 
        4. Share professional articles and   resources 
  
           
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 
Several assessments are used to evaluate and inform our ELL program, such as, NY state ELA and Math exams, and NYSESLAT. 
The NYSESLAT is used to evaluate the English language proficiency of our ELL population. This information is used to inform 
instruction for the following school year as it is administered yearly each spring. The NYSESLAT helps ENL specialists to 
determine the skills with which our students have difficulty, and therefore, provide the foundation for any/all interventions for 
the modalities that require improvement. For example, an analysis of the 2017 NYSESLAT revealed that ELLs across all grade 
bands struggled with the writing portion of the exam. On the other hand, students generally performed well with the speaking 
portion. Instructors can use this information to incorporate more strategies for improving written output, such as the use of 
graphic organizers, and ensuring that language objectives target the skills needed for students to organize their writing so that 
ideas develop coherently and cohesively. 
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

At PS/MS 206 the integrated and stand-alone classroom models are used in the ENL program. In the integrated (co-
teaching) ENL model, students are taught by both the certified ENL instructor as well as by the content teacher in the 
mainstream classroom, simultaneously. In the stand-alone model, students are taught in heterogeneous groups either 
in the classroom designated for ENL instruction groups or the library. Most of the stand-alone classes are according to 
grade level. Ideally the goal is to have a homogeneous group of students all at the same grade level, and this is 
achieved in some cases. In some cases the stand-alone groups are comprised of heterogeneous bands of students in 
two consecutive grades. Approximately 60% of the classes for ELL students are conducted via the integrated model. 
The other 40% are conducted via the stand-alone model. It is the school's goal to move more and more towards the 
Freestanding ENL classes being conducted via the integrated model with collaborative team teaching so that ELLs do 
not miss out on content area instruction. Instruction is aligned with the NYS standards and is geared towards 
extending and supporting classroom study in the content areas. The amount of instruction an ELL student receives per 
week is determined by the student's NYSITELL and NYSESLAT exams.   As described in CR Part 154.2, students who are 
designated entering or emerging receive 360 minutes of instruction per week.  Students who are designated 
transitioning or expanding receive 180 minutes of instruction per week.  Students who are designated commanding 
receive 90 minutes of instruction per week.               

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

We currently do not have a TBE program. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

The DL program is a 50/50 two way program. We use a side by side model in which students alternate their language 
of instruction each day so that students receive instruction in core subjects (ELA; Math; Science and Social Studies) in 
both English and Spanish. There are six ICT classes that utilize six rooms in the school.   Throughout the day both 
heterogeneous and homogeneous groupings are used for content instruction as well as SSL and ESL instruction.  In 3rd 
grade Dual Language, math, ELA, science and social studies are taught in both Spanish and English.  In 4th grade Dual 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81 

 

 

Language, math , social studies and ELA are taught in both English and Spanish. In 4th grade, science is taught in 
English.  In 5th grade, science and math will be taught in Spanish and ELA and social studies will be taught in 
English. Throughout the day both heterogeneous grouping are used for content instruction as well as SSL and ENL 
instruction.   

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The ENL program follows the guidelines set for CR Part 154.2. In the integrated (co-teaching) ENL model, students are taught 
by both the certified ENL instructor as well as by the content teacher – in the mainstream classroom, simultaneously – to 
ensure students are receiving ELA instruction. In the stand-alone model, students are taught in heterogeneous groups either in 
the classroom designated for ENL instruction groups or the library. This model allows the ENL teacher the ability to deliver 
specific ENL instruction – using HLA strategies when necessary.  Students at the entering and emerging levels receive 360 
instructional minutes through both integrated and standalone instruction.  Students at the transitioning and expanding levels 
receive 180 instructional minutes through either a combination of integrated and standalone, or only integrated.  Students at 
the commanding level receive 90 instructional minutes through integrated instruction only.  In the Dual Language program 
ENL, ELA and HLA instructional minutes are incorporated into core content instruction as well as designated into periods 
throughout the week for SSL and ENL instruction. To provide standalone minutes to entering and emerging students, the ENL 
teacher works with a small group in  the classroom or in another room.                    .     
                
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 
 
 
The core content is delivered by the dual language program   through our side-by-side model.  There   is one classroom used 
for English instruction and one room used for Spanish   instruction.  The teachers in these   classes plan together to ensure 
continuity between the English and Spanish   instruction. Three periods of common planning time are provided to help in this   
effort. The side-by-side model to ensure that instruction is provided in both   languages and meet the demands of the CCLS. 
The content areas are approached   through the development and delivery of lessons for ELLs that have both   language and 
content objectives. The content objective would be the theme or   subject with which the ENL teacher works for that (i.e. 
Westward Expansion in   Social Studies). The language objective is a complement to the content   objective, in that it will help 
to make accessible to the students the   language that they need to interact with the content (i.e. students will   write in the 
past tense when retelling a story. The Common Core Learning   Standards are beneficial in creating ENL curriculum that are 
heavily focused   on ELA and specific language goals and can be translated into language   objectives for lessons. The ENL 
program is delivered by 3 licensed ENL   teachers. Also, co-planning and collaboration between the ENL and mainstream   
classroom teachers provides the ENL teacher with further knowledge of the   content that the mainstream classroom teachers 
are addressing. This helps the   ENL teacher to further scaffold the material to make it more accessible to   English language 
learners. Methods such as front loading vocabulary for   reading and using visuals to support vocabulary comprehension have 
been   effective in helping to make the content more accessible for ELLs.            
  
• Our   freestanding English as a new language (ENL) program provides instruction in   English with home language support, 
emphasizing English language acquisition.   The ENL teachers service the students using one of the two models: 
1. Stand-alone   ENL instruction – during this instruction the ENL teachers develop the   English language skill so that students 
can succeed in the content   areas.  ENL teachers plan their lessons   to ensure that there is curricular alignment and continuity 
of instruction   between what they are teaching and what classroom teachers are teaching. 
   2. Integrated ENL instruction – during this type of instruction ENL teachers build English language skills through   
     content area instruction.  ENL and classroom teachers collaborate in lesson planning.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          82 

 

 
 
 
           
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

 
The ENL teacher conduct the Spanish LAB (after attempting to conduct the NYSITELL) to assess the student's proficiency level. 
Since over 85% of the ELLs in P.S./M.S. 206M have Spanish as their L1, this method is particularly effective as it gives the ENL 
teacher some understanding of what literacy skills are in their L1. Based on this assessment and the students’ NYSITELL, 
Spanish LAB and NYSESLAT results, the teacher determines when the students should utilize translations available for state 
level tests and resources such as translated tests or translators to read the questions to students in their native language. The 
teacher also have access to Home Language Arts materials and math translated materials in the students’ Home Language are 
used to evaluate content knowledge the students’ home language.                       
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
 
We differentiate instruction for the following ELL subgroup   as follows: 
A.  Currently,   there are no SIFE student at P.S./M.S. 206M. 
B.  Newcomer:   Our current data shows that our newcomer ELLs are at the entering proficiency   level.  The plan for ELLs in 
U.S.   schools for less than three years is as follows: -Total Physical Response   (TPR), basic conversation, and vocabulary 
development are part of their   instructional program. More advanced students receive ENL through the content   areas. -
Newcomers to this country receive the mandated 360 minutes or ENL   instruction per week. -Taught in groups for maximum 
opportunities to work on   listening, speaking, reading, and writing. 
C. Developing:   Create graphic organizers for use in content classroom as well as ENL   classroom. Provide visual glossaries and 
other visual supplements for text   heavy readings. Group students with other students on similar proficiency   levels for direct 
instruction from a content or ENL teacher. 
D.   Long-term:   Provide high-interest; low-level books- Further development of Tier 2 and 3   words- Further grammar 
instruction to assist in writing development. 
E.  Former   ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status: Provide instruction and   supports for up to two years after scoring 
‘Commanding’ on NYSESLAT- As   necessary, provide one-on-one support with writing- Provide plenty of models   and 
examples of exemplary work.             
The strategies mentioned above are used by Dual Language, content area, and ENL teachers.                
         
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Identified ELL-SWDs receive individualized academic support both within and outside of the classroom. Scaffolded instruction 
is provided to provide them with instruction tailored to the needs of each student. The specific needs of each student and best 
practices of instruction reflect the needs outlined on students’ Individualized Education Plan (IEP). Classroom teachers and the 
ENL teacher work together to provide the best instructional strategies and to help maintain instructional consistency inside 
and outside of the mainstream classroom. These practices provide access to content areas in addition to accelerating ELL-
SWDs language development. Such instructional strategies and grade-level materials include but is not limited to: adapted 
readings and lessons from curricula and texts, increased use of visuals and video, small group instruction, repeated directions, 
modified directions. Additionally, bilingual dictionaries are provided to students to support their native language development. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          83 

 

Our ENL and special education teachers work together to provide each student with the appropriate content and instruction 
through the use of these materials and strategies.                       
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The school has all necessary services to meet the needs of all of the students in the school who have IEPs, including ELL 
students. The ENL teacher collaborates closely with special education teachers to give students extra support for the ELA test. 
In addition, the ENL program has meetings with the School Based Support Team (SBST) to closely monitor the ELL students 
who have Individualized Education Plans (IEPs). This collaboration allows us to focus on our students specific academic needs, 
to monitor their progress, and adjust instruction as needed. Teachers of ELL/SWD students use accommodations such as 
charts, preferential seating, break schedules, individual schedules, supportive checklists, on-task prompt cards, graphic 
organizers, and visuals to create instruction accessible to each student according to their needs. Teachers employ specific, 
familiar vocabulary and use technology to provide instruction that allows students to engage in learning through the academic 
content areas as well as to accelerate their English language development. P.S./M.S. 206M provides the least restrictive 
environment for ELL/SWD students through placement in ICT, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Nest classrooms and classes 
that are collaboratively taught between the certified ENL instructor and the mainstream classroom teacher. ICT and ASD 
classes are taught by two teachers - one Common Branch-certified teacher and one Special Education-certified teacher. Both 
teachers have attended and continue to attend Professional Development (PD) days at which the best practices for ENL 
instruction are discussed and  strategized. The ENL teacher pushes into these classrooms to provide ENL services in a small 
group setting right outside of the classroom. This instruction is coordinated with the other service providers in the school, 
including Physical and Occupational Therapy, Speech Therapy, and AIS and SETSS services.                  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Instruction for ELLs in English language development is provided at the Tier 1 instructional level by using the core curriculum, 
(TC Reading and Writing, Passport – Social Studies, CMP 3, and Go Math).  Students move into Tier 2 and Tier 3 if they 
demonstrate a need for more targeted and intensive academic support. This extra support occurs in the classroom, but also in 
separate settings with instruction focused on specific learning targets. Tier 2 and Tier 3 instruction is tailored to meet ELLs’ 
language needs and incorporated into research-based intervention strategies.  In both the ENL classroom and students’ 
mainstream classroom, assessments are used to guide instruction and inform teachers of present levels of performance. 
Teachers College Running Records are used to indicate a students reading level and the particulars of the language (i.e. syntax, 
interpreting meaning) with which a student may be struggling. Also, Measures of Student Learning (MOSL) tests are 
administered toward the beginning of each year to assess students' skills in ELA and math. In regards to ELLs, many of the 
interventions occur in small groups, whether in a intergrated or stand alone. The ENL then makes the language more accessible 
in a number of ways. For example, in a math lesson in which ELLs are working with word problems, the ENL teacher will 
highlight key vocabulary words in efforts to lead the students to choosing the correct operation to solve a problem. In the case 
of an ELA lesson, the ESL teacher will often frontload certain vocabulary words and use employ visuals more so than in a 
mainstream classroom. Subgroups such as "Entering" and "Emergent" ELLs will sometimes be provided with a bilingual 
glossary for certain tasks. For ELLs with IEPs, the ENL teacher will meet with the special education coordinator in efforts to 
accommodate not only the linguistic needs of the students, but other needs as well. For example, if a student needs a certain 
amount of breaks over a period or if a student works with a paraprofessional, space and accommodations can be made. In the 
case of one student, a paraprofessional accompanies him to the classroom and I can have a lesson in which I utilize the 
paraprofessional and modify the lesson (i.e. highlighted vocabulary, having the directions read aloud) so to make it more 
accessible to the student.  
 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

With the expansion of our dual language program we will continue  to meet as a dual language leadership team to help assess 
changes that may need to be made. In addition, the results from the ELL Periodic Assessment  indicate that in writing student's 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          84 

 

perform relatively less in the degree of response.  Therefore, the ENL instruction for  the upcoming year will target analysis and 
elaboration in student's writing. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

 There are no plans to discontinue the Dual Language and ENL programs. .  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to multiple school-wide enrichment and extended-day programs, including homework help, 
school sports teams such as cheerleading, School's Out New York City (SONYC) by City Year, and Bronx Arts Ensemble, choir, 
Phil Ramone Orchestra and PubliColor. In addition, the school receives Title III funds to administer an after school program 
specifically for ENL students. This program, which is staffed by certified ENL teachers, provides ENL students with additional 
support with English language development through instructional activities that are language-based and designed with 
research-based scaffolds.   The school invites ENL students to participate in enrichment and after school programming by 
distributing communication to families through flyers, which are translated into Spanish. Classroom teachers, ENL teachers, 
and administrators may recommend students to these programs during their communication with families, including formal 
family engagement programming such as Curriculum Night. Administrators send daily reminders to staff via e-mail about 
deadlines for program applications, which are then communicated to students and families. Additionally, staff members from 
these programs present at family engagement events, such as PS/MS 206 orientation.           
          
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 
 
ENL and content area teachers design and create scaffolded   instructional materials for ELLs in both content area classes and 
standalone   instruction. Scaffolds may include: graphic organizers, guided notes, anchor   charts, manipulatives, exemplars and 
anchor texts, glossaries of key   discipline-specific terms and Tier 2 words that include translations, videos   with subtitles, and 
additional comprehensible input such as PowerPoint   presentations. The ENL extension utilizes ENL-specific strategies by   
presenting material with increased comprehensible input such as a slower pace   of speaking and subtitles. Translation 
applications and web-based services   such as Google Translate are frequently used by ENL teachers to scaffold   instruction, 
especially when targeting vocabulary acquisition. Students are   encouraged to use these tools as well in their production of 
language. The   ENL will translate portions of instructional materials into students' home   language based on English language 
proficiencies. The ENL office and resource   room includes a library with dictionaries in Spanish, French, Russian, Wolof,   and 
Arabic, as well as an extensive collection of bilingual books in English   and Spanish and monolingual Spanish books.              The 
following instructional materials are used to support the ELLs in the    standalone  program:   1. Decodable readers    2. Audio 
books   3. Scaffolded readings   4. Graphic Organizers   5. Exemplars 
6.Focus on Academic Language, Literacy, and Vocabulary 
7. Link Background Knowledge and Culture to Learning 
8. Increase Comprehensible Input and Language Output 
9. Promote Classroom Interaction 
10. Stimulate Higher Order Thinking and the Use of Learning   Strategies 
11. Conferring notes 
12. Daily Classwork 
13. Unit: formative and summative assessments 
14. Writing on Demand 
 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is assessed and delivered in the ENL and Dual Language as follows:  Teachers use prompts in Spanish if 
needed to support the students home language. Teachers also translate prompts or other components of instructional 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          85 

 

materials into students’ home languages. There is also a sizeable of bilingual (English and Spanish) and Spanish monolingual 
books available in the ENL resource room and office. The approximately 15% of ENL students who speak Chinese, French, 
Fulani, Russian, and Wolof are permitted to use bilingual dictionaries for translation purposes when necessary, as well as web- 
or app-based translation services. When taking standardized math and science tests, ELLs have the option of receiving a test 
booklet in their native language as well as access to bilingual glossaries.  They can also have the questions and directions read 
to them in their native language. The school has a number of bilingual staff members that have the ability to communicate in 
Spanish  French, and Bengali. In the Dual Language program, students receive 50% of instruction in English and 50% in Spanish, 
which supports the home language of students who are Spanish-dominant. Instruction in Spanish is delivered by two certified 
bilingual teachers. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The required services support, and resources correspond to ELLs' grade levels more than they do to ages. This is the case 
because certain students have been held back one or more grades or have returned to their country of origin for some years, 
which has interrupted their schooling in the United States. Service and resources correspond to grade level because the ENL 
teacher remains in close contact with mainstream classroom teachers and utilizes themes and texts from the content area to 
inform stand alone instruction. This provides a situation in which ELL students are engaging more deeply with the material 
with which they are working in their mainstream classes. The instruction of the material is re-conceptualized by the ENL 
teacher and is broken down into lessons which take into consideration not only content learning objectives, but language 
learning objectives as well. The type of language that the content employs and that the ELL students must use to respond to 
the content or content assessments is considered more deeply and made more accessible for the students. Also, in the 
integrated  model, the services and resources correspond to the ELLs' grade level even more directly as the content area is 
being co-taught by the mainstream classroom teacher as well as the ENL teacher. The language is made more accessible in real 
time by the ENL teacher as instruction by the mainstream classroom teacher is taking place. Through both the stand alone and 
integrated instruction, students are interacting with the content they are learning about at their grade level, while developing 
the linguistic tools to engage with that content more deeply.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
At this time, this is N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 
  
   Such activities include orientations, parent teacher nights, dances, and other cultural events. Also, all ELL students are 
entitled to take   
    part in the Title III-sponsored after school program, which aids in enriching their English language skills and is staffed by 
certified ENL   
    teachers.           
                   
 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

The school offers Spanish and it is offered to  ELLs as an elective in grades 5th - 7th.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          86 

 

 

a. The school uses a side by side model for the Dual Language program. English-dominant and Spanish-
dominant students are integrated for 100% of instructional time. Both classes that comprise the Dual 
Language program have English-dominant and Spanish-dominant students. All core subjects are taught in 
both English and Spanish, and the program model is such that students learn in an English-only room with 
monolingual teachers for one day and switch to a Spanish-only room with bilingual teachers the following 
day for literacy and math. The same model is used for social studies and science.  b. The 3rd  and 4th 
grade Dual Language classes are instructed in math, ELA and social studies in both English and Spanish. c. 
Students receive half of their instruction in English and the other half in Spanish.   Language is taught 
through content areas as well as through literacy. All content-area are taught in the Spanish and 
English.  A home language arts component designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and 
writing in the students’ home language. d. Both languages are taught simultaneously.   Literacy and math 
skills  are introduced in both English and Spanish according to an alternating language pattern for the 
day.  
 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 
 
  
District staff and the Division of English Language Learners host multiple professional development days throughout the year 
during which aligning instruction with the Common Core Learning Standards is the primary objective. Activities within these PD 
opportunities may include: reviewing both seminal and recent literature related to ENL learning, applying theoretical 
frameworks to teaching that involve CCLS-based tasks to determine possible challenges or barriers to entry, exploring how 
Common Core standards engage students in language, and discussing specific strategies for scaffolding instruction and learning 
activities that are CCLS-aligned. Administrators encourage  relevant professional development trainings to teachers of ELLs, 
including ENL and bilingual teachers.     
                   
 
 
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Administrators inform teachers and staff of relevant PD opportunities, including those facilitated by the Division of English 
Language Learners.  They further ensure that the stipulations of Part 154 are met by prioritizing trainings and professional 
development specifically for the integration of ENL learning frameworks and instructional strategies with discipline-specific 
content and practices. For example, an ENL teacher was directed by administrators to attend two trainings in the linguistic 
considerations of math and science discourse, both of which were offered by the Division of English Language Learners. These 
trainings aligned with the mandate for professional development that strengthens' educators' understanding of the integration 
of ENL instruction with content learning.   Administrators also allot a portion of in-school professional development to ENL-
specific themes. For example, for an upcoming professional development day, ENL teachers will host an information session 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          87 

 

 

for all classroom teachers and staff, followed by weekly meetings about instructional strategies for ENL students. Engaging ENL 
teachers in school-wide PD this way supports efforts to meet the stipulation that 15% of hours for all teachers relate to the 
instruction of ELLs.   All staff members maintain records by filing agendas from professional development hours, including 
school-wide PDs, as these include a portion of the ENL-specific training.  Agendas from District trainings are similarly filed by 
individual staff members. Administrators maintain attendance sheets for each PD session, and when staff attend trainings and 
workshops off-site they sign any available attendance sheets. For teachers who meet with the school's instructional 
consultant, including ENL teachers discussing issues related specifically to the teaching of ELLs, the consultant maintains 
records of dates and times that she meets with teachers.                     
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The school provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs include but are not limited to: incoming student 
orientations,  school curriculum nights, PTA meetings, and IEP meetings. Additionally, the Dual Language program hosts 
monthly parent meetings to provide information about programming and student progress. Throughout the year, ENL teachers 
schedule individual meetings with families of ELLs to discuss goals, current performance, and next steps.  These meeting 
include face to face or conference calls with parents and any interpreation services, as needed to discuss the program goals, 
student progress, assessment results, and language development in content areas.   All teachers use their Tuesday afternoon 
designated parent outreach time to meet or speak individually with family members about students' progress. For ENL 
students, this outreach include discussion of language development and further needs. The staff includes a number of 
personnel who are fluent or proficient in Spanish, French, or Bengali, and if needed these staff members may provide 
translation during interactions with families. The school also utilizes the Office of Translation and Interpretation to provide 
translations for documents for families as well as contracting interpreters when needed for in-person meetings.  In the past, 
the school has outsourced translation services to The Big Word.     Parent sign attendance log for all meetings.Teachers take 
notes during these meetings that also list the date and topics discussed. Both classroom and ENL teachers keep the sign-in log 
and meeting notes on file to maintain records of these individual meetings. Additionally, when teachers e-mail or call parents 
for outreach, the communication is recorded in the Parent Contact Log for all parent outreach.      
 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

 
  
 The meetings typically inform parents about the current and   upcoming curriculum, teacher observations of student progress, 
and ample   opportunity for parents to ask questions or report their own observation of   the child's language development, as 
well as any concerns they may have.       The school's parent coordinator schedules multiple events with the specific   objective 
to support families. For example, the coordinator will schedule a   morning informational fair in the school's gymnasium to 
inform families about   current opportunities for students and local community resources. Outreach   for this event included 
bilingual flyers and phone calls to students' homes   from the coordinator, who is bilingual (English and Spanish). The parent   
coordinator also assists with translating notifications of school events,   such as an upcoming cheerleading performance and 
Zumba class, into Spanish.       There are also periodic school-wide meetings for families like Curriculum   Night to reach out to 
parents and keep them informed of the school's   activities.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Camille Forbes, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We identify language preferences for both written and oral communication using data collected from various 
sources. Our ENL teachers use data collected from the HLIS and share that data with the school secretary to make 
sure that the correct information is entered into ATS. We also check with parents to see if there are any changes 
needed on emergency cards during parent-teacher conferences. All cards are collected and changes that are 
necessary are made in ATS. The ENL team references the RAPL screen on ATS to identify at student level which 
languages will be needed for interpretation.
