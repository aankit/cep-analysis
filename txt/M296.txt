Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Through a rigorous curriculum, students will develop problem-solving skills that prepare them for post-secondary 
education, as well as exciting careers in hospitality management and culinary arts.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The High School of Hospitality Management was established in 2004. It is located in the heart of the resurgent Clinton 
area of Manhattan, where there is the highest concentration of hotel and hospitality establishments in New York City. 
This challenging school combines a curriculum that provides traditional academic courses as well as career and 
technical courses. Our professional staff, parents, and students are equal stakeholders in the creation of an 
invigorating and supportive learning environment.  

84% of students attending the High School of Hospitality Management are eligible for Title I services and support. The 
demographic of the students is currently 70% Hispanic, 22% Black, 8% Asian. The population is 32% male and 68% 
female. 

As of 2017-18 our attendance rate was 84%. Our 4-year graduation rate was 82%, with a 6-year graduation rate of 
89%. 54% of students were enrolled in college within 6 months.  

Strategic collaborations and partnerships:  

Over the last several years, we have developed and nurtured several partnerships to help us fulfill our mission and 
vision:

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Based on the Principal Performance review (2017-18) in which the superintendent indicated that teaching practices 
were developing in components 3B, 3C, and 3D, informal observation data in Advance (2017-18) where several 
teachers were receiving developing in components 3B, 3C, and 3D,and the School Quality Review which identified 
teacher pedagogy as a focus area (" Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students 
learn best that is informed by the instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to the curricula, 
engaging, and meets the needs of all learners so that all students produce meaningful work products"), we provide 
accurate feedback to teachers aligned to the Danielson Framework on teacher practice, as well as the need to 
increase the level of higher order thinking in our classrooms by bolstering our questioning and discussion practices.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, the High School of Hospitality Management will provide accurate feedback to teachers using the 8 
components of the Danielson Framework, focusing particularly on components 3B, 3C, and 3D. This will change or 
improve pedagogical practices, and move teachers from developing to effective in these components. The instructional 
adjustment will correlate to an increase in higher order thinking and student engagement as we develop ongoing 
questioning, discussion, and assessment practices.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

One of the school's strength in the Collaborative Teachers element of the Framework for Great Schools is its teams. 
We are configured in three teams (Grade, Department and Circular 6 teams) which meet at least 1x month to 
collaborate on professional development, curriculum design and implementation, parental outreach, academic 
support and intervention and social emotional development. Teachers contribute to the development of the 
professional learning map for each academic year based on their knowledge of students, their self identified 
pedagogical needs, as well as feedback from observations in Advance. Based on Peer Quality Review report (2013-14) 
which indicated a need to increase the level of rigor in classrooms across the school, Principal Performance review 
(2017-18) which indicated the need to “revise the school’s professional learning plans to ensure transference in the 
classroom,” and supported by informal observation data in Advance (2017-18), we have identified the need to

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

We will develop inter-visitation protocols and implement 
departmental inter-visitations through the lens of the Danielson 
Framework for Teaching. The focus of the inter-visitation will be 
questioning and discussion (component 3b) as well as 
assessment (component 3d) of the Danielson Framework. TM 
will provide professional development for teachers using "train 
the trainer" model to eventually build in-school teacher leader 
capacity. Professional development topics will be based on 
identified needs and interest.  

The purpose of the inter-visitations is for teachers to observe 
best practices from colleagues and to implement them in their 
classrooms. The focus of the inter-visitations will include a lens 
for special needs and ELL students, as well as writing strategies.  

The activity/strategy listed will be introduced to parents via SLT 
meetings. Parents will also be invited to various workshops, open 
houses and curriculum nights.

In 2018-19 we implemented Technology workshops led by teachers. The workshops focused on strategies used to 
promote discussion in the classroom. These workshops impacted teacher practice because they exposed them to new 
tools they can use in their classrooms. We want to continue to develop this initiative because we believe all teachers 
have areas of strength they can showcase to support their colleagues. As a result of the impact of teacher led 
professional development, we want to continue to promote instructional leadership and build teachers’ arsenal of 
instructional tools which will lead to improved student outcomes per the element of Effective School Leadership of 
the Framework for Great Schools

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
High School of Hospitality Management utilizes various strategies to attract Highly Qualified Teachers, defined as 
teachers who have earned their master’s degree and are licensed in their content area. The strategies include: hiring 
committee composed of several teachers, the guidance counselor, the school Social Worker, the dean, the assistant 
principal and the principal to conduct interviews; multiple rounds of interview for each candidate; meeting with 
students and demonstration lessons. The school recruits at DOE sponsored career fairs and through the Open Market 
Hiring system .  

To promote retention of highly qualified teachers, the school encourages professional growth by providing 
opportunities for teachers to lead through a facilitative leadership model, as well as conduct professional 
development to support their colleagues.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Staff participates in professional development in order to develop methods and techniques as appropriate to their 
own content area. Teachers receive professional development on the Danielson Rubric, Depth of Knowledge, and 
Common Core Learning Standards. Per teacher interest, the school provides several technology PDs including how to 
create websites, questioning and discussion strategies, etc. The school is also looking to send several teachers to 
Advanced Placement training over the summer in order to increase its AP offerings. Teachers will participate in 
professional development activities centered on the use of formative assessments and the use of the data to guide 
development of instructional strategies. Teachers who have attended professional development on formative 
assessment will turnkey their knowledge to the faculty.  

All advisory teachers receive professional development in the HealthCorps curricula adopted by the school.  

Teachers, besides the ones on the SLT, will attend SLT meetings on a regular basis in order to develop a better 
understanding of parents and their needs.

September, the MOSL team, after conversations with the various departments, selected the appropriate assessment 
measures the school will use.  

In MOSL teams, teachers conduct item analysis of Regents data to inform curriculum development and instruction. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not

available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. High School of Hospitality Management, in compliance with the Section 1118 
of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

High School of Hospitality Management will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

The ELL Saturday Academy English Language Instruction Program at the High School of 
Hospitality Management (HSHM) is aimed to boost English language skills in the four 
modalities of speaking, listening, reading, and writing for 35 ELLs in the 9th-12th grades. At 
HSHM, 28 students tested expanding, 6 students tested transitioning, 1 student tested emerging, 
based on 2018 NYSESLAT. We also have 13 Special Education ELLs who would benefit from 
the program and supplemental instruction. 
  
The ELL Saturday Academy English program aims to boost academic language skills, improve 
reading comprehension, and increase writing skills through the use of various strategies. The 
program will be delivered  in English, with home language support as needed. 
  
HSHM is dedicated to fostering an environment of academic excellence leading to college 
readiness. Therefore, we would like to provide the ELL enrichment program to our population of 
35 ELLs in grades 9-12 during the 2018-19 school year. Starting October 2018 and ending June 
2019, the program will meet once a week on Saturdays from 10:00 - 1:00 p.m. The program will 
meet for a total of 34 sessions over 34 weeks for 3 hours per week. The ENL teacher and the 
English Language Arts teacher will serve as instructors for the ELL enrichment program. ELLs 
will receive vocabulary and literacy support to increase reading comprehension, writing skills, 
and language and content-area learning through the use of technology, including Empower3000, 
an online literacy program. At the end of the course of study, students will have a portfolio of 
work which demonstrates the skills acquired during the ELL Saturday program.  
  
The service providers for this program will be the certified ELL teacher and the 11th grade 
English teacher. The program will require approximately 204 hours of per session costing 
approximately $12,372.60 The ELL teacher and 11th grade English teacher will use various 
models of direct instruction, including team teaching and flexible grouping based on 
NYSESLAT data, Empower diagnostic results, and as determined by students' needs. The ratio 
of instructional time will be determined by the ELL teacher and the ELA teacher. At least 50% 
of instruction will be provided by ELL teacher. HSHM currently has a subscription to the web-
based literacy program Achieve 3000. Our school chose Empower 3000 (from Achieve 3000) 
because it is an interactive and motivating tool for high school students. The online program 
brings relevant, up to date information from recent newspaper articles, with activities that are 
tailored to each pupil's reading level. In addition, all lessons, as well as reading and writing 
activities from the program, are aligned to NYS Common Core standards for both ELL and ELA 
learning objectives. Teachers will use a gradual release model to allow opportunities for students 
to work at their own level after direct instruction/modeling/guided pace. Also, the program's 
assessment capabilities and its capacity to deliver non-fiction reading and writing activities from

categories of 0-3 years of service, 4-6 years, Longer term, SIFE and special education. 
Furthermore, through parent accounts, ELL families will be provided information about student 
reading and writing progress, as well as the opportunity to read and discuss articles at home both 
in English and Spanish.

Begin description here:            
  
During the 2018-19 school year, the certified ESL teacher will attend Achieve 3000 professional 
development. The purpose of the PD is to increase teacher's knowledge of Empower 3000 to 
better integrate the software into the curriculum, to align teaching to ELL/ELA Common Core 
standards, and to better use the writing component of the program. The ESL teacher will also 
attend "Supporting ELL with On Demand Writing" PD offered by the Office of ELL to support 
students with the ELA regents. The ESL and 11th grade teacher will also participate in "writing 
to demonstrate learning" PDs provided by Teaching Matters as part of the school's instructional 
focus to improve student outcomes.  These will include "writing across content areas, using a 
writing rubric to provide feedback/assessment, as well looking at student work to adjust writing 
instruction PDs." Three PDs will focus specifically on supporting ELLs "Using the 
PLUSS Framework for ELL instruction, "Code Switching" chapter from Dr. Emdin's "For White 
Folks Who Teach in the Hood" to engage ELL students in the classroom, and Using Checklists 
to Support writing in the ELL classroom." Professional development activities take place on 
Wednesdays. Teachers will also receive professional development relating to supporting ELLs 
on an on-going basis.  During the 2018-19 academic year, the certified ESL teacher and the 
ELA teacher will attend PD provided by the Office of ELL support as relevant and applicable to 
needs of students.  All teachers will receive professional development focusing on monitoring 
student learning throughout the school year. The PDs will be provided by Teaching Matters and 
the school. Some of the titles will be: "Making Sense of Text Strategies" on October 17, 2018 
provided by Teaching Matters; Writing across the curriculum on December 12, 2018 provided by 
Teaching Matters; and Developing Culturally Responsive Education for ELLs on February 13, 
2019 provided the school.  The PDs are at no cost to Title III. Professional development sessions 
are from 2:45 - 3:45 p.m.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Begin description here:            
  
Title III parents will be provided with information about individual student reading and writing 
progress, as well as the opportunity to read and discuss articles both in English and Spanish at 
home. The ELL teacher will be the provider for all ELL related activities. To encourage 
participation and motivate students to use Empower 3000 with parental supervision and support, 
HSHM plans to inform parents at Parent Teacher conferences, during parent outreach time, 
through letters, and through communication from the ELL teacher and the Parent Coordinator. 
Parents of ELL students will also be invited to various workshops throughout the year designed 
to support students, especially as they prepare for College and Career. These workshops provide 
information about options and opportunities. The meetings take place on the second Tuesday of 
the month from 9:30 - 10:30 a.m.  Specifically, on November 13, 2018 a representative from US 
Department of Education will conduct a workshop on how to engage ELL parents and resources 
to help prepare students for college; on December 11 2018, a representative from the NYC DOE 
College and Career Office will present a workshop on understanding the college/financial aid 
process for ELL students; on January 8, 2019, parents will engage in professional development 
on the topic of "making sense of text strategies to support ELL students." The parent coordinator 
attends all parent workshops and provides translation services for parents. These programs will 
be at no cost to Title III. We will continue to support parents by providing a survey at the 
beginning of the year to ascertain what other topics they may want to find out more about.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
HSHM uses readtheory.org and Achieve/Empower3000 are used as formative assessments to provide insights into students' 
reading abilities.  Narrative based, teacher-created formative assessments are also given in ELA classes to assess writing. The 
writing is reviewed for vocabulary, sentence structure, and grammar to gauge the level of support the students may need. 
Additionally, abridged ELA regents exams are used at the beginning of the year to 11th grade students. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The ENL teacher collaborates with the English teachers to develop, administer, and review formative assessments. ELL 
students take online assessments with ENL teacher. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

We evaluate the success of programs for ELLs through the following: 1.) passing or increasing NYSESLAT scores and 2.) passing 
or increasing Regents examination scores (English, Global, U.S. History, Living Environment, etc.), with scores meeting or 
exceeding AYP for ELLs. We also evaluate written student work, oral presentations, and fluency in reading and writing through 
teacher-created assessments,  as well as computer programs with assessment capabilities, including Empower3000 and 
readtheory.org.       
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The ENL and ELA teachers collaborate to make curriculum adjustments and determine the skills that need to be made the 
focus of units or lessons. When reviewing lesson units together, teachers determine how the ELLs can be supported with 
additional time, supports, and opportunities to practice targeted skills.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to question here:    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The NYSITELL was administered to 1 student in 2016-17 school year. The student has since returned to Sweden as he was only 
in the US for 1 semester. All 33 eligible students received NYSESLAT scores from the 2016 test.  According to the NYSESLAT 
2016 results (last known score), 4 students were rated Commanding, 19 students were rated Expanding, 2 students were rated 
Emerging, and 8 were rated Transitioning. 
  
NYSESLAT 2016 results by grade level: 
o     Of twelve (12) 9  th   graders tested: 2 tested as Emerging; 3 tested as Transitioning; 6 tested as  
       Expanding; and 1 tested as Commanding 
o     Of ) eleven (11) 10  th   graders tested: 5 tested as Transitioning; 6 tested as Expanding; and 1 tested as     Commanding 
o     Of eight (8) 11  th   graders tested: 6 tested as Expanding and 2 tested as Commanding 
o     Of two (2) 12  th   graders tested: 2 tested as Expanding 
  
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We share NYSESLAT data with all teachers. ELA teachers in collaboration with the ENL teacher disaggregate the data to inform 
instruction.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The freestanding ENL program provides intensive instruction and intervention. Students gain access to high-interest, 
lower level to grade level classical literature, as well as non-fiction reading materials such as articles from the New 
York Times  and Achieve 3000 that are both multi-culturally relevant and age appropriate. Instruction is primarily 
focused on providing more scaffolding and individualized attention along with targeting academic vocabulary building, 
and improving reading, writing, and speaking skills.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

The integrated ENL program provides more support for ELLs in their content area English class. The students receive 
more individualized attention and sheltered instruction as needed. Students engage in project-based learning with an 
emphasis on creativity, writing, and oral presentation, which encourages the use of higher-level thinking skills. 
Lessons in the Freestanding ENL program are aligned to New York State ESL, English, and Social Studies standards. 
ELLs will read and engage in project based activities. Selections among different grades include the short stories "The 
Most Dangerous Game," by Richard Connell and "The Tell Tale Heart" by Edgar Allan Poe (9  th   grade), The Book of 
Unknown Americans (10  th   grade),  and of The Crucible/The Great Gatsby (11  th   grade). ELLs will also focus on 
academic vocabulary, argument, debate, current issues, and other subjects with a focus on literacy.  
Students are grouped in classes based on NYSESLAT proficiency, 8  th   grade ELA scores, and ELA Regents scores 
within grades. In their content area classes students are grouped heterogeneously so that ELLs and SWD can receive 
optimal support from their peers.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here:    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The principal is intimately involved in the scheduling process. NYSESLAT scores influence the schedules students have and help 
to ensure students are provided with mandated instructional minutes. Next, the guidance staff and the ENL teacher verify that 
all students entitled to receive ESL services receive mandated hours, reviewing student programs to ensure that the minutes 
are appropriately allocated. HSHM has freestanding ENL instruction and ENL instruction is integrated into English classes. 
Entering ELLs receive 180 minutes of freestanding ENL, 180 integrated into ELA, and 180 integrated into other content area 
classes; Emerging ELLs receive 180 minutes of freestanding ENL and 180 minutes ENL integrated into ELA; Transitioning ELLs 
receive 90 minutes of  freestanding ENL and 90 integrated into ELA; Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of ENL integrated into 
ELA, and Commanding ELLs receive 90 minutes of ENL integrated into ELA . 
  
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The Freestanding ENL model instruction is delivered by the certified ENL teacher who employs a variety of instructional 
approaches (small groups, project based activities, visual vocabulary, writing process, and presentations) to make content 
comprehensible to students. Achieve3000 is also used in the Freestanding ENL program to supplement instruction and provide 
on-grade level, high quality non-fiction materials for students to engage with.   
The integrated model used in the ELA classrooms. The certified ENL teacher and ELA teacher collaborate to plan and execute 
lessons that provide students with access to high interest classical literature and non fiction reading materials, vocabulary 
instruction, writing strategies/process, and oral expression through discussions/presentations.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Using programs such as Achieve3000, which have reading assessments in Spanish, we are able to determine a reading level in 
both English and Spanish. If the student is a newcomer, we get a sample of the student's writing in the native language, have 
the information translated, and are then able to evaluate some of the student's skills in that language.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

In terms of SIFE students, we would plan lessons in Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS) and vocabulary, 
multicultural awareness, phonemic awareness, grammar, academic language, and overall adjustment to school and life in the 
United States, among others. SIFE students may also need extra instruction in literacy, including explicit teaching of the English 
alphabet, phonics, and basic English reading skills. With SIFE students, we also sometimes work on basic to intermediate 
mathematics skills, whenever necessary. Total Physical Response, or TPR, in which students perform actions based on written 
and spoken commands that are modeled by the teacher, are effective with both SIFE and newcomer students.  
With the facilitation of an ENL teacher, SIFE students may create PowerPoints for oral presentations based on literature, 
culture, and their own lives, in collaboration with other students who speak the native language.  
Teaching techniques, such as those from QTEL, can be well applied to SIFE students. Students can engage in collaborative 
projects that exercise all four ESL modalities, and that scaffold content-area literacy, while building English language skills.  
SIFE students are often behind in academics, but can learn content material with modifications and scaffolds. SIFE students will 
have access to higher-level learning through writing personal and academic essays and through reading high-interest, low-level 
nonfiction and literature. SIFE students will engage in projects involving technology and the arts.  
Afterschool programs, employing technology such as Achieve3000 and project-based learning, are available to all ELLs.  
  
  
b. Describe your plan for ELLs in US schools less than three years (newcomers). Additionally, because NCLB now requires ELA 
testing for ELLs after one year, specify your instructional plan for ELLs.  
Newcomer students with less than 3 years of service vary a great deal in their English language skills, depending on the 
strength of literacy in the native language, and prior background in the English language. For example, a student with 3 years 
of ESL service may read at a third grade level in English, while another ELL may read at a fifth grade level. Therefore, at HSHM, 
we aim to differentiate instruction for the student, meeting the pupil at his or her level.  
For example, some newcomers may need similar interventions as SIFE students. Since newcomers may know little, if any 
English, they need to develop conversational and survival English, as well as basic vocabulary, phonics, and academic language. 
Teachers will help ELLs to build and use oral expressive language, and focus on activities that employ listening, reading, and 
writing skills, before the students can even go onto the next challenging step: reading to learn in content area classes. 
Newcomers also need help in adjusting to living in a new country and culture, not to mention new classes, in a variety of 
subjects which are all in English. Therefore Native Language Support (NLA) from peer groupings, dictionaries, visuals, and 
whenever possible, comparison of English vocabulary and grammatical structures to the native language, is helpful to 
newcomers.  
On the other hand, some newcomers accelerate in conversational language very quickly and may already be integrated into 
content area classes. In this case, the newcomers still require a great deal of support from all teachers. Both content area and 
ENL teachers need to activate existing schema through visual, auditory, tactile, and multimedia aids. More specifically, 
newcomer ELLs should receive a high quality education that focuses on higher-level thinking skills. Newcomers should receive 
opportunities to express themselves, primarily in speaking and writing, at every opportunity through daily interactive journals 
and project-based learning. Technology, such computers, digital cameras, and Smart Boards can be used to engage emergent 
bilinguals, since they provide visual, auditory, and tactile content to enhance lessons. Furthermore, website translators, word 
processors, and teacher or student-created Power Points can help students to learn and research new words and phrases in 
English, as well as to create multi-media presentations to showcase learning in the classroom. Moreover, portfolio 
assessments are more helpful in understanding the progress of a newcomer, more than standardized tests results they show 
progress based on objective, as well as subjective, measurable goals.  
After school programs, employing technology such as Achieve3000 and project-based learning, are available to all ELLs and 
Former ELLs.  
  
c. Describe your plan for ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years. HSHM ELLs in the category of 4-6 years are at a critical period in 
which literacy must be developed sufficiently to help these students become successful high school graduates, college 
students, and members of the productive American workforce. At this point, most ELLs are either at the intermediate to 
proficient levels of speaking and listening, and at the beginning to advanced levels of reading and writing. ELLs in the 4-6 year 
category continue to require explicit teaching of literacy strategies, vocabulary, and content to become proficient in academic 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

English. According to University of Toronto Professor Jim Cummins, it takes 1-2 years for ELLs to attain Basic Interpersonal 
Conversational Skills (BICS), while it takes at least 5-7 years for students to catch up academically with their peers. Our plan 
with the 4-6 year group is to 1.) use collaborative strategies (e.g. QTEL) and plan activities that encourage higher-level thinking 
skills, 2.) explicitly teach academic vocabulary to enhance comprehensible input in the content areas, 3.) allow students to use 
technology such as Achieve3000 2-4 times a week during class and after school, and 4.) help students to relate to information 
in a meaningful way through project-based learning, which concludes with a synthesis and application of what students have 
learned during a thematic unit. As abilities and skills in English vary greatly, many of the strategies used with newcomers and 
SIFE students can also be employed to the 4-6 year group.  
  
d. Describe your plan for Long-Term ELLs (completed 6 years). Long-Term ELLs (LTEs) are often not aware of reading and 
writing problems because they approximate the conversational English of a native speaker. Therefore, LTEs benefit from 
explicit instruction in reading, writing, grammar, and vocabulary in English and the content areas. Long-Term ELLs benefit from 
explicit instruction in academic language, as they do not usually lack conversational language. English composition is often 
difficult for LTEs, and therefore the use of graphic organizers, with a focus on transitional words, may be helpful in the creation 
of essays. The Schaffer Method of paragraph writing can be used at this stage to scaffold the essay writing process. Since LTEs 
may read below grade level by 1-3 years or more, they can benefit from high-interest content that has a tailored reading level. 
Achieve3000, with its leveled non-fiction, as well as leveled short stories collections such as the Burton Goodman 5-Star Series, 
are helpful in teaching LTEs who are in need of literacy intervention. LTEs still can access the content of classical novels 
through teaching strategies and techniques that include building schema, books on tape, and QTEL strategies.  
  
e. Describe your plan for Former ELLs (1 to 2 years after passing the NYSESLAT exam). Former ELLs receive push-in classes in 
general education classes, including U.S. History and English. They continue to receive ESL strategies in both reading in the 
classroom, and receive personal attention in writing paragraphs and essays. Former ELLs are eligible to attend afterschool ESL 
and Regents Prep classes. They are also enrolled in a special English Regents Prep class during the school day if they did not 
pass the test. Former ELL students receive the same testing accommodations as current ELL students including extended time, 
use of bilingual dictionaries, three readings of the listening passage on the Regents Exam, and use of a glossary. Former ELLs 
receive 2 years of ENL services integrated into their ELA classes at least 2 periods per week, totalling 90 minutes.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELLs identified as having special needs are also often Long-Term ELLs. ELLs with IEPs will show learning disabilities in both the 
native language and the second language. Depending on each individual, ELLs with special needs have problems concerning 
language acquisition, reading and writing fluency, concentration, memory, emotional disturbances, and cognition. ELLs with 
special needs require tutoring in small groups and one-on-one time, while whole group instruction should focus upon creating 
meaning through collaborative examples (such as in showing a new strategy for writing topic sentences and eliciting feedback 
from students to complete the task). The Certified ENL teacher works with content area teachers to deliver lessons that 
explicitly teach vocabulary and literacy skills, while encouraging higher-level thinking, with a focus on writing and formulating 
interpretation and analyses based on evidence. For the most part, lessons should be very structured, with the use of clear 
directions and explanations. Native Language Arts may benefit the student through the use of bilingual literature and picture 
dictionaries, along with visual, auditory, and tactile aids. Furthermore, teaching ELLs with LD may include the use of shorter 
instead of multi-step directions, graphic organizers, and activities in which peers can help to tutor one another. 
Achieve3000/Empower3000, a computer literacy program, has been used with great effect with our SWD; students enjoy the 
interface and receive encouragement to increase reading skills through instant feedback from multiple-choice activities. ELLs 
identified as having special needs benefit from all interventions that help SIFE and Long-Term ELLs. In all content area 
classrooms teachers use smartboards and include images and videos in lessons to support learning. Students also have access 
to laptops and online learning tools such as Brainpop, Juno, and vocabulary.com--when used with fidelity, these materials 
accelerate language acquisition.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

  
ELLs with LD have reading/writing intensive instruction with the ESL teacher, where they work on literacy, writing, and test 
preparation (i.e. PSAT, NYSESLAT, etc.) Both ELLs and former ELLs with LD are enrolled in English Regents Prep, where they 
receive multiple strategies and practice in writing essays. ELLs with LDs are integrated into all classrooms, and are able to 
benefit from a number of literacy strategies, including graphic organizers, RAP strategy for writing, paragraph and essay writing 
formulas, and instruction with more than one teacher, etc. All students are eligible for the after school program, in which we 
use Empower3000, technology, and other resources for literacy, increased content knowledge, and enrichment. Students' IEPs 
and NYSESLAT scores are reviewed for programming recommendations and students are placed in the appropriate, least 
restrictive setting. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ELL students are invited and/or selected to participate in after-school tutoring and Saturday Academy to support preparation 
for ELA, math, Social Studies, and Science Regents. Achieve 3000 and other online learning tools are used to support ELLs; they 
are encouraged to utilize these resources for at home practice. All after-school tutoring is in English utilizing ESL strategies; 
students have access to enrichment materials and activities in Spanish through the online learning tools.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We will continue to monitor various data points for ELL students (including periodic assessment data, mock regents data, 
teacher constructed tests) and make adjustments as necessary.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

As of now, no programs will be discontinued. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELL students participate in all extra-curriculum activities and academic support programs offered at HSHM. They are informed 
of these opportunities using the same methodology used to inform all students in the school.  Letters are sent home in both 
English and the students' home languages to inform parents. Information is also posted on the school website. All students, 
including ELLs, are invited to in-school recruitment events. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
ELL students receive Achieve3000/Readtheory.org support which provides them with high quality, on level, nonfiction reading 
and writing opportunities. ELL students participate in blended learning opportunities created by their classroom teachers. The 
use of technology to support ELLs also includes the use of smartboards and laptops in classrooms. Students also have access to 
Brainpop, online vocabulary building resources such as vocabulary.com, and online quizzes and enrichment resources on Juno. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Students have access to bilingual dictionaries, exams in native language, and resources (such as glossaries) in native language.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All services, support, and assistance to ELLs are based on school's knowledge of students. Instructional outcomes are planned 
and assessed based on appropriate methodologies. NYSESLAT scores and ELA 8  th   grade scores are reviewed to ensure 
proper placement within the grade. The ELL teacher and the Special Education teacher provide differentiation strategies to 
teachers to support the ELL/SWD population.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
ELL students receive Achieve3000 support which provides them with high quality, on level, nonfiction reading and writing 
opportunities. ELL students participate in blended learning opportunities created by their classroom teachers. The use of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

technology to support ELLs also includes the use of smartboards and laptops in classrooms. Students also have access to 
Brainpop, online vocabulary building resources such as vocabulary.com, and online quizzes and enrichment resources on Juno. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Incoming HSHM are invited to participate in a June orientation. Further, a curriculum night is held in September for all parents. 
Lastly, parent meetings are scheduled as appropriate to discuss student needs. The guidance counselor and Parent 
Coordinator are involved in each of these activities. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

All HSHM students, including ELLs, complete two credits in Italian 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Staff (including the Parent Coordinator) will attend the following professional development activities: Q-tel: building the base; 
Demystifying ELL data; 4-day writing workshop for ELL; Achieve3000 training; Inter-visitation with other ELL schools; LAP 
training; Developing Academic Literacy and Research Based Vocabulary Instruction. The staff meets in departments on 
Wednesdays for PD on unit planning, assessment strategies, questioning/discussion techniques. The ENL teacher provides 
professional development by offering strategies and materials that will benefit ELLs.   
Developing Academic Literacy and Research Based Vocabulary Instruction; Literacy Strategies; Scaffolding Instruction; Best ENL 
Practices and Methodologies; Interpretation vs. Analysis; Differentiating Instruction for ELLs Needing Special Services. the ENL 
teacher will be sent to Common Core professional development as well as ENL specific training.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Staff is provided with opportunities for professional development throughout the year to support their students. ENL teacher 
serves as a resource for content area teachers. The guidance counselor is trained in the NYCDOE over-the-phone interpretation 
services as well as an overview of the NYSESLAT levels.  
HSHM meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2 by providing in-house professional 
development opportunities, arranging for inter-visitations, providing coverages for teachers to attend outside PD on ELL 
instruction. Records are kept via attendance sheets, agendas, materials/resources provided. Records of teachers' professional 
development activities are stored in teacher's files, as well as attendance record keeping binder.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Individual meetings occur either at the request of the parent or at the request of the ENL teacher. If the parent needs a 
language other than Spanish, the ENL teacher will arrange for an interpreter through the DOE's phone translation service. 
Records of the meetings will be kept in the student's file. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

ELL parents receive phone calls and letters from the ENL teacher that inform about available after school programs and the 
student’s progress. The ENL teacher often uses an over-the-phone interpreter when calling parents. The parent can arrange a 
meeting at any time to talk with the ENL teacher about progress and goals for the student. The Parent Coordinator conducts 
and organizes outreach to parents in both Spanish and English, as well as through the interpretation service.  
ELL parents are invited to attend parent-teacher night conferences, PTA meetings, student presentations, and other 
conferences. The NYCDOE over-the-phone interpretation service is used for parent conferences, and a number of staff speak 
other languages, including Spanish, French/Creole, Romanian, and Italian.  
Translation and interpretation services are available through the DOE and we use this service frequently. We use the services 
to translate official letters and make three-way phone calls to parents so that teachers and staff members can communicate 
with parents about student academic issues and progress.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Yves Mompoint, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Based on the HLLS of students, as well as ATS, and student emergency cards, the home languages, both written 
and oral, for all our students are as follows: Arabic (5), Bengali (10), Chinese (3), English (85), French (3), 

Haitian Creole (4), Mandinka (1), Spanish (283), Urdu (1), Tibetan (1) for a total of 397 students. Student language 
demographics, as well as translation and interpretation resources, are shared in the fall of the school year with 
staff members. Members of our staff speak Spanish, Haitian Creole, French, Russian, and Italian. Telephone 
communication with parents is done bilingually through over-the-phone interpretation for the primary nine 
languages of NYC. All home phone calls are made by Spanish-speaking staff or through over-the-phone 
interpretation and translation services for a variety of languages. Whenever necessary, we request the help of a 
staff member who speaks Chinese from a nearby school, Manhattan Bridges, for both translation and 
interpretation. All printed information sent home is in Spanish and in English. When a letter needs to be sent in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

another language, we consult with staff members in the building who may speak that language to help translate, 
or use NYCDOE translation and interpretation services. At Parent-Teacher conferences, Spanish- and Chinese-
speaking interpreters are available to facilitate communication between the teachers and the parents.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

We use over the phone interpreter to translate phone message in the necessary languages before broadcasting. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

All teachers receive the over the phone interpreter desk aid flyer, along with the chancellor’s regulations  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Schools must determine within 30 (thirty) days of a student’s enrollment (or, for students already enrolled, by a date 
and procedure to be determined by the Office of Teaching and Learning) the primary language spoken by the parent 
of each student enrolled in the school, and if such language is not English, whether the parent requires language 
assistance in order to communicate effectively with the Department. The parents have the right to have written and 
oral communication in their native language if they do not speak English. Therefore, the school shall, consistent with 
this regulation, provide translation and interpretation services to all parents who require language assistance in order 
to communicate effectively with the school. The Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities, including rights to 
translation and interpretation services, are made available to parents in the nine primary languages. Signs to the 
school and office near the entrance include the primary languages, and indicate the availability of interpretation 
services. Safety plan procedures are provided for ensuring that parents who need language access services are not 
prevented from reaching the school's administrative offices due to language barriers. The Bill of Parent Rights and 
Responsibilities for all primary languages, as well as signs indicating availability of translation services for safety and 
practical reasons, are provided for the nine primary languages (or for 10 percent or more of student body who speak a 
particular primary language). At HSHM, approximately 50 percent of our student parents speak and read in Spanish, 
45 percent speak and read in English, and 5 percent of our students speak and read in 12 other languages. Staff 
members may orally interpret and assist during one-on-one meetings between parents and the school; they also 
translate documents sent home to parents. NYCDOE may provide translation and interpretation services over-the-
phone or via translated documentation in the parents' native language if staff members and adult volunteers are not 
available. Because knowing the population in critical in the establishment of relationships and communication with 
our students' families, we gather information about home native language through HLLS forms, student emergency 
cards, ATS, and ARIS, and inform our staff about the results. We also provide staff members with information 
regarding how to use translation and interpretation services offered at the school or from the City. Oral interpreters 
may be hired through an outside contractor (working with the DOE) to assist during Parent-Teacher conferences and 
one-on-one meetings.

Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

HSHM will use parent surveys to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services.
