Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The Magnet School of Communication and Media Arts through Applied Learning offers all students a rigorous 
academic experience across the content areas with an emphasis on 21st century communication skills, creative arts 
and media.  

It is our mission to ensure that all PS 46 students receive a high quality, well-rounded education that will serve as a 
solid foundation for their future successes. The Magnet School of Communication and Media through Applied 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Learning incorporates project-based interdisciplinary activities so that students are able to utilize 21st century skills 
through media, explore their wondering and share their learning.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Utilizing the SEM students’ work individually and in cooperative teams as they take on leadership roles according to 
their unique skills and talents and explore topics and discover solutions to real world problems within units of study 
aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards.  

Our communication and media arts focus ensures that all students are technologically and culturally literate while 
preparing to be able to compete in a global society. Students engage in digital learning communities as they apply 
their learning across the content areas. As part of this initiative students use Skype, Face Time, Renzulli Learning (a 
component of SEM), as well as other resources.  

Teachers broaden their pedagogical skills through training in the School-Wide Enrichment Model (SEM) from experts 
at the University of Connecticut at Storrs. SEM is a research-supported model for total school improvement with the 
goal to provide and promote challenging high quality learning experiences for all students. Teachers are trained to 
develop the talents of students by assessing their strengths, identifying their interests and creating appropriate and 
engaging curricular activities to promote student growth and achievement. As life longer learners teachers continue 
to develop their skills and serve as models for their students. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We serve a population which includes 90% Eligible for Free Lunch, 20 % of students in temporary housing, 18% ELLs, 
25% SWDs. Our student population is split about equally between Black and Hispanic students with 2% reported as 
“other”. We provide a Spanish dual language program providing instruction in Spanish to all students. This 
strengthens our school as a whole as all students are exposed to a second language, not only the students in the dual 
language program. Our multicultural community is strengthened through this additional second language exposure.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Through the culminating effect of all of our most recent initiatives we have made great progress during the last school 
year in Framework for Great Schools Element Section – Collaborative Teachers . Building on our strengths we will 
strengthen and deepen the Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction. Our improvement plan 
works from a focal point of high expectations with work in refining our curriculum, deepening the practice of our 
teacher teams, leadership development implemented through teachers taking on leadership tasks and further 
refining our assessments.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
A year long Curriculum Map has been designed to ensure that Science Technology Engineering Mathematics and Art 
are integrated into the Magnet Units of Study. There is some integration of Ready Gen and Core Knowledge to 
support the ELA program. Go Math is used for the mathematics curriculum. Additionally, teachers focus on problem-
solving skills that are assessed every Friday through the use of Exemplars.  

Last year's data indicated only 20% of students that took the 2017-2018 ELA exam were proficient in Level 3 or Level 
4. Additionally, results of the Teachers College Running Records, the Writing on Demand Benchmark Assessment and 
the Measures of Student Learning (MOSL) results indicate that students are performing below grade level standards 
for their grade. Although teachers are using Ready Gen Core Knowledge and other resources, a more coherent 
curriculum needs to be implemented to support English Language Arts. 

After analyzing the last state ELA and Math assessments, we identified the five standards that need the most focus for 
our students. They are standards RL.3, RI.3, RI.2, RL.2, and RL.6. Additionally, none of our ELLs met proficiency 
standards. Only 1% (2 students) met the proficiency standard. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, K-5 teachers will collaboratively develop rigorous CCLS-aligned units of study and performance tasks to 
improve rigorous instruction as evidenced by all teachers rated Effective in Danielson 1e, 3d and 3c.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
We will provide a three-part learning series that will unpack a select standard and reading strategies that parents can 
use at home to help their students. This will occur during the Fall, Winter, and Spring. The presentations will be lead 
by the principal, Universal Literacy Coach, and teacher leaders. We will also host family literacy activities during 
parental engagement time on Tuesday afternoons.

Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
To achieve this goal we will need to ensure common planning time for each grade. In addition, to the 80 Minute 
professional development session every Monday, we will also need to provide in-house professional development 
with the Consultant from Teaching Matters. Grade Leader's meeting with the principal will also be built into the 
preparation schedule. Professional literature to support the development of Common Core aligned rigorous lessons 
needs to be purchased.  

 

9-10 hours of Per-Session will be needed for the Data Specialist to support in data analysis, preparing Historical Data 
reports, providing professional development. 10-15 hours of per session will also be required for additional 
curriculum planning time for 10 teachers. 12 hours of per session will be required for additional planning preparation 
and delivery of parent workshops.  

Over 30 hours of per session will be required to support the after-school program for English Language Learners 
(target group).

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By the end February 2019, we will have completed two six-week inquiry cycles of progress monitoring of the selected 
focus standards. Each inquiry cycle will end with an on-demand writing prompt that assess student progress towards 
proficiency in those focus standards. Each assessment will assess all of the targeted focus standards for the year. To 
monitor growth, teachers will collect the data and analyze the data to identify growth and areas of need. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
We will use common grade-level performance assessments and CCLS Aligned rubrics. 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
1. Our school has done great work to ensure we have a culture and climate that supports our diverse students and 
challenges them. We offer a dual-language program that is taught by native speaking Spanish teachers. Our staff is 
incredibly diverse and sensitive to the different cultures of our students. We have celebrations for Hispanic Heritage, 
the Chinese New Year, and Black History Month. Students in our building know the names of all of our teachers and 
our teachers treat all students in the building as their own. 

 

2. Last year, we had 28 OORS reports that were rated a Level 3 or 4. The school needs additional structures to help 
promote student leaders that can help their peers in mediation. Students also need more support in developing 
effective coping skills to prevent them from acting out in the building.) 

Our priorities this year will include a Social Emotional Learning program and professional development for al staff 
members. We want to purchase the 4R's Curriculum and professional development from a Morning side Consultant. 
These services will also promote student voice and development of social emotional strategies to students, staff and 
parents..  

We also want to create additional opportunities for parents to volunteer their time in our school. Based on the 2017-
2018 School Survey 68% of parents said they felt that they were offered opportunities and we want to increase that 
number by at least 5 percent.  

3. To ensure that we are supporting the whole child we have created Children Are Reason Enough Team comprised of 
the Guidance Counselor, Social Worker, School Psychologist, Special Education Teacher and administrator. Teachers 
and parents will be invited as required. Monthly Community Circle in which we promote pro-social behaviors through 
monthly themes, lessons and activities. Every morning, the principal reads a positive and inspiring message from the 
Project Wisdom curriculum to promote pro-social behaviors across the school. Mediation sessions as needed are held 
by the administrator. During lessons, we have students working in collaborative groups and partner work to create an 
environment where students feel free to express themselves and take risks.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. PS46 rated well above district and city levels in Teacher Collaboration in our most recent Snapshot and past Quality 
Reviews. Magnet funding, no longer available, has contributed to our ability to collaborate and reflect. We need to 
continue to sustain these high levels. with reduced funding. 

2. In recent years, there has been some inquiry work, but a school-wide protocol needs to be implemented. Although 
there is teacher collaboration regarding curriculum design, a more structured approach to data analysis and data 
driven action plans is necessary to increase student achievement. This will entail data analysis, identification of the 
focus standards we will focus on and professional development to support the implementation of the school-wide 
protocol. We will need to revise the preparation schedule to ensure that common preps support Collaborative 
Teacher Team meeting time.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, all teacher teams will engage in four cycles of inquiry using a common school-wide protocol as evidenced 
by meeting documents such as agendas, attendance pages, protocols followed, and meeting minutes.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met.

2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 13K046, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

PS46K will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.  

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

13K046, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here: 
Rationale: English Language Learners (ELLs) need extra support in the acquisition of English 
for academic purposes, especially with the added demands associated with the Next Generation 
Standards. We have found that a focused elementary school after-school program with small 
groups can accelerate the development of English skills as measured by the annual NYSESLAT. 
This year we will use our Title III funds for direct supplemental instructional services which 
complement core bilingual and ENL services in such an after-school program. 
Subgroups and Grade levels of students to be served: All subgroups of ELLs in the school will 
be included: Newcomers, 4-6 year ELLs, Long-term ELLs, SIFE and Students with Disabilities. 
Former ELLs will be encouraged to attend as well. All grades from Kindergarten through Grade 
5 will be included.  
Tasks for different subgroups will be differentiated by the teachers according to student needs. 
For Newcomers, this means particular attention to the acquisition of basic vocabulary and 
grammatical structures. Teachers will assign tasks using picture dictionaries, gestures, realia and 
on-line resources to meet the needs of these students. 4-6 year and Long Term ELLs will be 
given activities that activate prior knowledge and use expanded vocabulary to attack higher order 
material.  Activities for SIFE students will address their deficits in academic development by 
stressing basic literacy needs. Tasks for SWDs will be modified according to their individual 
needs as indicated in their IEPs. 
Students in Kindergarten, First and Second Grade and other Newcomers will concentrate on 
developing basic interpersonal communication skills and the cognitive academic skills that they 
need to be successful in school. Students in Grades Three, Four and Five will build on that 
foundation to hone their development of academic English skills to prepare them for the rigorous 
approach to the curriculum expected of them. 
Schedule and duration: The Extended Day Program will take place two days per week, on 
Wednesdays and Thursdays, for two hours each day from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. for 8 ½ weeks, 
starting in January 2019 and ending in March, 2019. The total number of days will be 17 and the 
total numbers of hours per group will be 34. 
Language of Instruction: The language of instruction will be predominantly English. The focus 
will be on English language acquisition and enhancement of English proficiency. Entering level 
students may need accommodations to make the input comprehensible. Since the classes will be 
conducted by licensed bilingual Spanish teachers, they will be able to differentiate for any 
Spanish-speaking students who need support. Bilingual dictionaries in the other languages of the 
school (Arabic, Bengali and Spanish) will be available as well to provide native language 
support. 
# and types of certified teachers: There will be four teachers, one for each group. All instructors 
will be either certified Bilingual or ENL Teachers, working per session. Each Teacher will work 
in a self-contained classroom with children grouped by their grade and English proficiency 
levels. The teachers will differentiate instruction for the students and maintain flexible groupings

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
so as to meet the students' needs most effectively. No content teachers will be providing 
instruction in these classes, which will be focused  on developing proficiency in English. 
Types of materials: Materials used will focus on English language proficiency in the four skills 
needed to succeed with the Next Generation Standards: Listening, Speaking, Reading and 
Writing. The basic texts for all classes will be the latest edition of Getting Ready for the 
NYSESLAT. These texts contain activities to develop all four skills. Supplemental materials will 
include the Oxford Kids Picture Dictionary, bilingual edition and the Oxford Picture Dictionary 
of the Content Areas, as well as bilingual visual dictionaries and word for word bilingual 
dictionaries.

Begin description here:            
Begin description here:   
 
Rationale: Teachers who work collectively to review their instructional strategies in light of best 
practices drawn from professional literature enrich their classrooms and improve student 
outcomes. Ongoing, recurring professional development has been found to be most successful in 
improving classroom practice. This is especially true as the Next Generation Standards call for 
greater rigor in all aspects of the curriculum. 
We have found that a regular study group affords the best setting for ongoing collaborative 
professional development. In the 2017-2018 school year we had a very successful study group 
with 7 participants on A Guide to Academic Conversations. 
Teachers to receive training: Every teacher in the school works with ELLs, so all teachers are 
invited to join the study group. Since a higher proportion of ELLs are in Dual Language classes, 
Dual Language teachers receive preference. Five teachers will be selected as participants, with a 
sixth teacher as the participant-facilitator. 
Schedule and duration: There will be one study group session a month from October through 
March. Each group meeting will be for one hour. 
Topics to be covered: This year the focus will be on building students’ ability to expand and 
structure their writing pieces. Data from the Beginning of Year MOSL assessment and ongoing 
class writing assignments will be analyzed along with a discussion of the language needs 
revealed. We will use Moving from Spoken to Written Language with ELLs, by Ivannia Soto, as 
a text. We will examine 
*how to use academic oral language development as a scaffold for writing 
*the genres of writing and the language necessary for each 
*how to develop productive writing prompts 
In addition, we will use the series to examine:

Part C: Professional Development  
*best practices for our Dual Language Program, based on a discussion of Bottom Lines for Dual 
Language Program 
* an Action Plan to improve equity for the two languages in the program 
Name of provider: The English as a New Language Teacher, Mr. James Johnson, will be the 
provider. 
Other PD for teachers of ELLs: The school develops a Professional Learning Community plan 
each year for all the staff. At least 15% of those topics concern improving instruction for ELLs 
and communication with their parents. 
Topics this year will include: 
* using the Translation and Interpretation service more effectively 
* analyzing the needs of ELLs based data from the NYSESLAT and MOSL scores 
* Vocabulary Development for ELLs  
*What to do when the ENL Teacher isn’t in the room 
*preparing ELLs for the NYSESLAT and other assessments. 
The Dual Language Teachers meet twice a month as a team for collaboration and ongoing 
professional development in best practices and issues with bilingual education.

Rationale: Parents who receive guidance in how to help their children in developing literacy and 
learning a new language can contribute significantly to the success of their children. This can be 
done by making high quality educational materials available in English and Spanish, and, if 
available, in other languages preferred by parents. It can also be fostered by offering workshops 
where teachers can share successful home learning activities with parents and answer their 
questions. The Parent Coordinator, Ms. Cecelia Lopez, will work with the ENL Coordinator, Mr. 
Johnson, to support parents and their ability to assist their children’s learning of English and 
Spanish. Educational software will be offered for learning to read in English and Spanish. 
Bilingual editions of books will be made available for parent read-alouds. Materials will also be 
provided for parents who speak other languages, especially Arabic, which has become more

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
common in the school community. Materials for parent engagement, such as books and bilingual 
dictionaries, will be purchased with Title III funds. 
Schedule and duration: Two sets of workshops will be offered to parents of children in the Dual 
Language and English as a New Language programs. These will be in January and March. Each 
meeting will be 1 ½ hours long offered in two sessions to meet parent needs. One session will be 
from 8:30 to 10:00 a.m. and the other from 5:00 to 6:30 p.m. In addition, there will be regular 
monthly workshops for parents of children in the Dual Language program during the Parent 
Engagement period on Tuesday afternoons on how to help children learning both languages in 
that setting. Of course, parents of newly enrolled students will be given the mandated parent 
orientations. 
Topics to be covered: Among the topics to be covered are, How to support the development of 
oral language at home, Read-aloud techniques, Reading fundamentals in Spanish with the 
Estrellita program, Using on-line resources for language learning, and Using Community 
learning resources (libraries, parks, cultural resources). 
Name of Provider: The ENL Teacher, Mr. Johnson, will facilitate all workshops for ELL parents, 
with the assistance of the Parent Coordinator, Bilingual Family Assistant and Dual Language 
Teachers. 
How parents will be notified of these activities: The Parent Coordinator, Bilingual Family 
Assistant and the ENL/Dual Language Coordinator will send letters and flyers to all parents of 
ELLs and English Proficient parents of children in Dual Language classes inviting them to each 
workshop session. Flyers will be posted in the school. Notices of meetings will be included in the 
bilingual monthly calendars sent home with students, and they will be posted on the school 
website. As reminders, emails will be sent to parents as well. 
Meeting the Translation needs of parents: The parent engagement meetings will be promoted by 
bilingual materials, from the monthly bilingual calendar that the Parent Coordinator produces to 
flyers and letters sent home in student backpacks and announcements on the school website. All 
communication from the school is translated into Spanish, the home language of almost the 
entire population of ELLs in the school. In addition, school announcements are translated into 
other languages with the help of the Translation and Interpretation Service. Since we have many 
staff members who are proficient in Spanish, including the Dual Language Teachers and the 
Principal, we are able to provide on-site interpretation at meetings for Spanish-speaking parents.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The NYSITELL and Spanish LAB help establish the initial baselines of student proficiency in English and Spanish. The NYSITELL 
determines which students are classified as English Language Learners (ELLs) and entitled to ELL service and determines what 
level of English support newly enrolling ELLs receive. 
For formative assessments we use the DRA  and the EDL, its Spanish counterpart. We want to have assessments that can be 
compared easily between English and Spanish. The benchmarks in both languages are assessed three times a year, with 
progress monitored on an ongoing basis. Teachers use data from the DRA and EDL to group students for reading instruction. 
After each assessment, teachers rearrange reading groups to align instruction with student growth. 
An additional assessment for Dual Language students is the Estrellitas Benchmark assessment which allows teachers to assess 
the phonemic awareness of students in Spanish and guides grouping for instruction in grade Kindergarten through 2nd. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

Students are assessed in the beginning of the year to establish what their phonemic awareness is. Then they are grouped for 
instruction and practice with the set of letters that corresponds to their current instructional level. The teacher periodically 
checks with all the students to see whether they have mastered that set; once they have, they move on to the next series of 
letters. After students master initial sounds, they progress to learning how to blend sounds to make syllables, then words and 
finally sentences. 
As all of these assessments  are administered over the course of the year, they are intended to guide teachers as they plan 
instruction and arrange grouping for differentiated attention to students’ needs. Teachers’ planning is also informed by 
student observations in the classroom throughout the year. 
In addition, teachers develop their own end of unit assessments cooperatively in their Teacher Teams. They have developed 
rubrics for evaluating writing samples that are specific to the different genres and modes of writing, for example, narrative, 
informative and persuasive. The rubrics are shared as well with the students, who learn to self-assess. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

A testing/data specialist coordinates testing for the school as a whole. He or she prepares a testing calendar so teachers are 
aware of the dates for testing. The Teacher Teams (TTs) discuss how to administer the tests and collect the data. The ENL 
Teacher takes responsibility for organizing the assessment in Spanish. The testing/data specialist collects and analyzes the data 
and shares it with the IEP Teacher, the ENL Teacher and the Teacher Teams (TTs). The Teacher Teams then discuss how best to 
modify and differentiate instruction to meet the needs of ELLs and other students based on the data.The ENL teacher 
participates in the discussion and analysis of the assessments to plan both for standalone ENL classes and Integrated 
instruction. Writing rubrics are introduced to students so they can internalize the standards, use them to help guide their 
writing and self-assess. In addition, student level charts are displayed in classrooms so students can see how they move from 
one level to another.          
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 Our school followed the recommendation of the New York State Education Department and implemented the Measures of 
Student Learning (MOSL) for English Language Arts and Mathematics. The MOSL was administered in the beginning of the 
year, the middle of the year and the end of the year to collect information on the progress of students in the course of the 
year in mastering the Common Core curriculum. With the data provided, teachers are able to plan more effectively for 
differentiation when providing small group instruction. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The summative data is integrated into the assessment and instructional framework of the Teacher Teams (TTs).  Teachers 
discuss the summative data in team meetings where it is compared with the results of previous summative assessments and 
formative assessments. Teachers consider whether to modify the differentiated groups in their classroom to make instruction 
more effective. The IEP Teacher and the ENL teacher participate in these discussions to help determine which methods, 
materials and groupings would be most helpful to move students forward and whether additional interventions would be most 
useful.The school has an RTI Team, including the IEP teacher, ENL Teacher, SETSS Teacher and other teachers, which meets to 
discuss children who have been identified by the TTs and what interventions would most likely help them. Teachers share this 
data regularly with parents during the parent engagement sessions that take place every Tuesday. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We use  the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework which provides for systematic work with all students in the classroom 
and an escalating process of interventions over a prescribed interval of time to determine if students are responding to the 
assistance they receive. We have established an RtI Team to plan and coordinate the use of RTI throughout the school and 
track student progress. The ESL Teacher is part of this team. Initially, students are offered Tier I interventions in the classroom 
as the teachers differentiate their lessons and customize instruction to student needs. The data from Running Records, DRA, 
EDL, Measures of Student Learning (MOSL) and other assessments are used to set up the groups and measure progress. Based 
on progress data, students who are unsuccessful in the core curriculum over a period of 6 weeks are provided with 
supplemental, research-based interventions matched to their needs for the next six weeks at Tier II. Students who still lag 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

behind in Tier II are moved to Tier III, where they receive more intensive interventions. After 6 weeks, children who continue 
to show limited progress may be considered for further evaluation by the School Assessment Team and additional services.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Several New York State (NYS) examinations are used to evaluate and inform our ELL program. The first is the NYSESLAT, which 
provides data on the performance of all ELLs near the conclusion of the academic year. This data is available through the RLAT 
report, and in more detail, the EDAT. By using this data in conjunction with summative assessments, such as the MOSL and 
formative assessments, such as the DRA and the EDL, we can develop a picture on the evolving English proficiency of ELLs and 
determine what assistance they need to move forward. We can also evaluate which aspects of our programs for ELLs need 
modification to meet the needs of ELLs. 
Under the No Child Left Behind Law, the New York State Education Department specified targets for single year gains and the 
per cent of students expected to achieve proficiency. Although such goals have not been communicated this year, we can 
examine the year to year movement of ELLs and the rate at which ELLs achieve proficiency as indicators of success and signals 
of areas that need attention. 
For students in Grades 3 through 5, it is particularly important to analyze the data on student performance on the NYS exams 
in English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics, and to a lesser extent, the Fourth Grade Science Exam, in assessing whether 
ELLs and Former ELLs are making progress in catching up academically to English Proficient students. 
        For students in the Spanish-speaking Dual Language Program, the ELE Spanish Reading test gives some information about 
the development of Spanish reading skills among ELLs and English Proficient (EP) students. This limited information is 
supplemented by the formative assessments mentioned above: Estrellita benchmarks and the EDL.           
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The Principal and Assistant Principal  oversee the regular dissemination of these findings, with the assistance of the 
Testing/Data Specialist and the ENL Teacher, who focuses especially on the data on ELLs. They do this first through the 
Professional Learning Community meetings, where data for the school and grades as a whole are presented. The discussion 
then moves to the grade-level Teacher Teams as well as the Dual Language TT. In the course of these discussions, adjustments 
may be made to the implementation of the programs in the school. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The Freestanding ENL program is designed for ELLs who are not in Dual Language or Transitional Bilingual Programs. 
Under the CR Part 154.2 regulations, a distinction is made between standalone and integrated groups. Stand-alone 
ENL groups are usually heterogeneous, including students at the Entering, Emerging and Transitioning levels, although 
if there is a group of Newcomers who are all at the Entering level, they may be placed in one homogeneous 
Newcomers' group.  Students in standalone or pull-out groups are from one or two contiguous grades, e.g. First and 
Second or Fourth and Fifth, and may be from different classes.  
Integrated ENL is delivered in the students' classrooms, and the ENL Teacher co-teaches with the classroom teacher. 
This model requires a high degree of coordinated planning between the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher to be 
successful. The grouping is usually heterogeneous , including all levels of ELLs, from Entering through Expanding and 
Commanding. The students would most often be from one class, although students could be pulled into one class on a 
grade.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

        b. We no longer have a TBE program,due to a change in population and parent choice, as described in Part IV, 
question number 13.    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

       
The majority of ELLs are in Dual Language classes. They follow the block model. They receive their ENL service as part 
of the classroom teacher's integrated instructional differentiation plan. A few with the greatest need for assistance at 
Entering, Emerging or Transitioning Levels  may be included in the ENL Teacher's stand alone groups. On the other 
hand, they may be grouped within the DL classroom for explicit  ENL instruction. 
       
 Students in Dual Language classes are grouped within their classrooms  according to their needs, but tend to be 
heterogeneous as no class contains only students of one proficiency level.  The classroom teacher groups 
the  students in flexible groups, sometimes homogeneous to focus on particular needs and sometimes 
heterogeneously to foster peer to peer learning. Former ELLs in Dual Language (DL) classes receive their Integrated 
ENL from their Dual Language classroom Teacher.  
  

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

       
    Dual Language 
ELLs receive ENL as part of the 50% of instructional time devoted to English instruction. The language-rich environment of the 
classes  includes a substantial population of students who are already proficient in English, and who serve as models for the 
ELLs. The DL teachers differentiate instruction while the EPs receive English Language Arts. Students at the Entering and 
Emerging levels receive 360 minutes of ENL per week, while students at the Transitioning and Expanding levels receive 180 
minutes of ENL per week and 180 minutes of ELA.  Students at the Commanding level will receive 90 minutes of ENL within the 
ELA period. Materials used include the AWARD Reading program, Ready Gen, Storytown and classroom libraries. In addition, 
the ENL Teacher may pull out ELLs at the Entering level who need extra help. 
 
Home Language Arts (HLA) instruction takes place during the Spanish half of the week. Students receive at least 5 periods of 
Spanish HLA a week. Home Language Arts Materials used include Villacuentos, the Storytown Program in Spanish, classroom 
libraries, AWARD Reading in Spanish and Estrellitas from Kindergarten to Second Grade. Next year we will begin using Palabras 
a su Paso to enhance development of Spanish spelling patterns in Grades 2-5. 
 
ENL 
English as a New Language 
The English as a New Language (ENL) Program is a Push In-Pull Out model that is aligned with the latest comprehensive core 
curriculum and methods conforming with the guidelines provided by the CR Part 154.2..  The mandated instructional time 
blocks of ENL/ELA will be adhered to as described in the ELL Policy Guide for 2016-2017.  Students who have scored at the 
Entering and Emerging levels on the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction a week. Students who 
scored at the Transitioning and Expanding Level receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction a week. Students who score at the 
Commanding level on the NYSESLAT receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL. 
 
Intensive intervention services for ELLs are provided by a qualified, licensed and certified ENL teacher. Although the ENL 
Teacher is responsible for coordinating all ELL services for entitled children, his main instructional focus is on ELLs who are not 
in DL classes. Where possible, he gives extra support to ELLs at the lowest proficiency levels in DL classes, in collaboration with 
their classroom teachers. The ENL Teacher articulates with the classroom teachers to ensure congruence between the ENL and 
Reading and Writing curricula. Instruction is differentiated according to the grade, level and needs of the students. 
    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

The CR Part 154.2 requires that a specified amount of ENL instruction be integrated within the students' classrooms. The ENL 
Teacher will collaborate with the classroom teachers to make this a reality. Time constraints have limited push-in instruction in 
the past and these may still apply. The ENL Teacher will look forward to professional development in how to achieve this 
mandate and continuing guidance from District ELL Specialists in how to schedule it successfully.      
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
     
In the Dual Language Program content area instruction is given in both languages. Math is primarily taught in English, with 
support from realia and hands-on math materials, but the students are also taught in Spanish with the Spanish version of Go 
Math and Everyday Math. Science and Social Studies are taught in both languages, using realia, pictures and experiential 
activities such as hands-on science activities, as well as bilingual DVDs, online resources,  text and trade books. 
       
 In Freestanding ENL, similar methods are used as content area subject matter is included in instruction. ELLs in monolingual 
classes are provided with Bilingual Glossaries for Math, Social Studies, Science  and Language Arts and have access to Spanish 
language Math books. Students who speak  Arabic and Bengali have access to bilingual glossaries in their languages 
appropriate to the different content areas and are able to use Bilingual dictionaries in class. As in all ENL instruction, students 
are given scaffolding to help them understand the content area material, including pictures, DVDs, realia and hands-on 
activities. Key vocabulary is pre-taught and extensive use is made of graphic 
organizers.                                                                                                                                                                                             
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  Almost all of the ELLs in PS 46 are Spanish-speaking; the main native language assessments available to us are in 
Spanish.  Once a child has registered,  a formal initial evaluation is given by the Spanish LAB, administered after the NYSITELL 
determines ELL status. This gives us an idea of the children's oral ability in Spanish, and, for children entering in the First Grade 
and above, their abilities in Reading. Subsequently, phonemic awareness in Spanish is measured with the Estrellitas Benchmark 
Assessment at the beginning and end of the year, and regular assessment of student progress is structured into the program. 
Students in Kindergarten through Fifth Grade DL classes are tested periodically with the EDL, the Spanish version of the DRA. 
The Examen de Lectura en Espanol (ELE) is given to all DL students starting in Third Grade. In addition, teachers use teacher 
made assessments on a regular basis. 
 
       DL classroom teachers have developed some math assessments in Spanish. Where available, MOSL and Benchmark Math 
assessments are given to Spanish dominant students. 
 
       In Freestanding ENL class, we do not use Spanish assessments, since the instruction is in English. However, Spanish-
speaking students are offered Spanish versions of Benchmark Math assessments, if they are available, and they can take the 
state-wide Math test in Spanish. 
 
       Since there are very few ELLs from other language backgrounds, and we have no staff qualified to design or rate 
assessments in their languages, we have not at this time administered such assessments. Should our population change, and 
significant numbers of students enroll speaking another language,  we would seek out assistance in seeking or devising and 
using the most appropriate instruments. If translated versions of any of the standardized tests exist in their languages we 
provide students with them. For the NYS Math and Science tests we arrange for outside interpreters to read the tests to the 
students in their own languages.      .    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

     
 Instruction should be differentiated so that students receive the appropriate level, kind and quality of instruction to meet 
their needs. Teachers use assessment data to analyze student needs, implement targeted instruction, and measure progress 
for the next round of intervention. In relation to ELLs, we differentiate both by age, so that children are grouped with those of 
similar developmental stages, and by membership in various subgroups: Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE), 
Newcomers, and Developing ELLs, Long-Term ELLs, and Former ELLs. 
 
       One form of differentiation has already been mentioned: students at different English proficiency levels receive different 
amounts of ENL and ELA instruction. Students at the Entering and Emerging levels receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction, 
while those at the Transitioning and  Expanding levels receive 180 minutes of ENL  and students who have passed the 
NYSESLAT with a Commanding score receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction for two years.. 
 
Subgroups of ELLs 
a. Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) 
         SIFE students are disadvantaged by their limited education in their mother tongues. They often  lack basic concepts of 
print and numeracy. Reading instruction in English for all SIFE is structured around their need to build literacy  and math 
concepts while trying to keep up with a grade-level curriculum. Some of the materials used include the AWARD Reading 
program and vocabulary development with the Oxford Picture Dictionary  of the Content Areas and  Words Their Way. The 
ENL Teacher works with the classroom teacher to build up an awareness of phonemic representation and structures of 
different genres of print. In Mathematics the use of manipulatives helps build up basic concepts. In Dual Language classes, 
Estrellita offers a program that helps develop Spanish phonemic concepts. 
 
b. Newcomers 
      When students first enter an English language school system, they must rapidly begin to acquire the medium of instruction 
(English) as well as the content of instruction. Students who speak Spanish can continue to receive extensive academic support 
in their native language in the DL classes, allowing them to both develop literacy in Spanish and grasp the fundamentals of the 
content areas. These skills can then be transferred to English as they develop a better grasp of the language. The DL teachers 
work out plans to facilitate this.  In the case of students who speak other languages, the ENL teacher works with the classroom 
teacher to develop a plan to make content areas as accessible as possible while accelerating the acquisition of English. If 
appropriate literature and content area materials are available in their language, we will try to secure them to help the 
student. Newcomers may be grouped together across two contiguous grades in their first year for additional attention by the 
ENL teacher. 
 
       Newcomers particularly benefit from introduction to an expanding vocabulary through use of the Oxford Picture Dictionary 
for Kids and, for older children, the Oxford Picture Dictionary in the Content Areas. Words Their Way is a program that both 
enhances vocabulary development and literacy development.  Listening comprehension and Reading comprehension are 
fostered by books on tape and CD and on-line. The AWARD Reading program offers a particularly attractive combination of 
guided reading texts and interactive software. AWARD materials are available in the school for Kindergarten to Third Grade 
levels, and can thus be used for a wide range of Newcomers and  the school has on-line licenses which are shared with parents 
so children can use them at home. Newcomers are also Included in Title III ENL Extended Day after-school program 
      
c. Developing ELLs 
        After three years of ELL services, it is not unusual for many ELLs to continue to need services. At this point, however, we 
can usually identify specific language modalities that need strengthening by analyzing the students’ performance on the sub-
tests of the NYSESLAT. Depending on the strand that is weakest, we differentiate with an emphasis on those skills. 
       ELLs who have not met the performance standard in listening may need to use books and on tape and CD in the Listening 
Center and be given dictation and note-taking practice. 
       ELLs who have not met the performance standard in reading should participate in read-aloud and Shared Reading 
activities, work in small Guided Reading groups and work on vocabulary development with Words Their Way. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

       ELLs who have not met the performance standard in writing could benefit from developing vocabulary to sharpen their 
writing, focus on improving use of grammar and syntax and develop portfolios with regular conferencing. 
All ELLs in this group should be:  
•               Included in Title III ENL Extended Day after-school program 
•               Included in Extended Day after-school program for Reading and Math skills  development in Grades 3-5 
•               given opportunities to work with the AWARD Reading program with multimedia support. 
 
d. Long Term ELLs 
        Long Term ELLs are those students who have completed six years of ENL service and still have not been able to achieve 
proficiency on the NYSESLAT. Although studies have shown that normal ELLs can take from three to seven years to reach a par 
with native English speakers, it is a matter of concern when students who have received six years have not reached the 
standard of proficiency. The strategies listed above would be used with them, but the child’s instructors would have to 
consider if an underlying learning disability needs to be addressed as well. A discussion in the RTI Team, guided by an 
examination of the child’s assessment data would be warranted to develop an additional strategy of intervention. 
e. Former ELLs: 
        Students who achieve proficiency (Commanding level) as measured by the NYSESLAT in the Spring continue to get support 
within the Dual Language (DL) and ENL programs for two years afterwards. One of the reasons that we decided to make a 
transition to a Dual Language model was precisely to provide a consistent medium of support for these students even past the 
2 year mandate. In addition, these students receive extended time on tests and are tested in separate locations along with 
ELLs. The ELL Coordinator works with classroom teachers, especially of those former ELLs who are not in DL classes, to ensure 
that those students continue to progress. These former ELLs  receive Integrated ENL instruction in their classes, focusing on 
vocabulary development and ongoing coaching as they pursue the challenging Common Core curriculum. 
     
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
All children with special needs are served according to goals set forth in their IEPs. Depending on the child’s particular needs, 
he or she may be assigned to part-time special education in the Resource Room  (SETSS) or Speech class, or full-time 
placement in a self-contained special education class. Some students also receive occupational or physical therapy. 
       The ENL Teacher articulates with the SETSS, Speech and Special Education classroom Teachers, as well as other classroom 
teachers to set and adjust the instructional program. Data from the students’ performance on the NYSESLAT is used to 
determine skills that need strengthening . Special needs children are included in groups with children from general education 
classes for ENL service. Some students who receive Resource Room or Speech services continue to be served as ELLs in Dual 
Language (DL) classes. Such students: 
•Are targeted for inclusion in academic intervention groups 
•Are included in the Title III after-school program 
•Develop Reading skills using the Wilson or Fundations program, where needed 
•Use AWARD Reading program materials. 
 
Speech/Language Instruction/Intervention 
 
       PS 46 provides Speech and Language services to children who have been diagnosed as having communication deficits in 
their first language and English. 
       The Speech-Language Teacher/Therapist, along with the Speech Supervisor, bring cultural competencies to the 
identification, assessment, treatment and management of communication disorders/differences of our students. 
       The monolingual therapist at PS 46 is New York State Licensed in Speech-Language Pathology and has had wide-ranging 
training in multicultural issues and second language acquisition. Students identified as dominant in their first language are 
provided service from a certified bilingual speech-language pathologist on a contractual basis. 
       Small group and individual therapy is provided to students who are in the DL program as well as those in monolingual 
classes from Kindergarten to Grade Five. Written reports are prepared incorporating information about the students’ cultural 
and linguistic influences. Therapy is provided for simultaneous language learners, using current research and best practices in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

the treatment/management of articulation, phonological, language disorders/delays, including various delivery models and 
options for intervention. 
 
 
       Differentiation of Instruction in the Resource Room 
       As a Special Education Teacher, the SETSS Teacher differentiates instruction by content, process and product.  When 
students come to him, they are assessed in order to determine their readiness, interests and learning styles. Students who 
have decoding and encoding problems are introduces to the Wilson Reading System, which is a multi-sensory, step-by-step, 
structured, sequential language program designed to help struggling readers. 
       Lessons in the Wilson Reading System are divided into three blocks: Word Study, Spelling and Listening Comprehension. 
The lessons in the Wilson Readers are graded to suit each student needs. There are twelve readers in the series. Every student 
begins from Student Reader One. Wilson Reading uses tapping in order to decode words. The Wilson program includes 
phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, fluency and comprehension. Formative assessments are done to determine if a 
student should continue to the next sub-step. A summative assessment is done at the end of each student reader. Students 
work in small groups of four or five or individually based on the students’ readiness interests and learning profile. 
Some students are taught using the Wilson Fundations Reading Program, which is an Early Intervention Program that caters for 
struggling beginning readers. This program reduces the number of students that become at risk by giving all children a solid 
foundation. Students are seen in small groups of about five or six students or on a one on one basis. It focuses on struggling or 
at-risk students in Kindergarten through Grade 3 in the lowest percentile. Students are seen for forty-five minutes, three to 
five times per week. 
 
       Students are taught Mathematics using concrete materials and visual aids. The Overhead Projector as well as the Smart 
Board is  used to demonstrate lessons.  Lessons are taught using a thematic approach that is related to real life situations. 
Instruction is more of an investigative nature that allows for group sharing. There is accountable talk in which the teacher 
allows for a variety of responses. 
 
       Students’ interests and strengths are considered when assigning work. Students are given extended time to complete 
assignments or fewer problems based on their strengths or weaknesses. Assignments contain directions that are clear and 
direct enough for students to understand. Directions are read and re-read aloud based on students needs. 
 
Self-contained Special Education 
       Students who are in self-contained classes receive ENL instruction according to their IEP. The Special Education teachers 
have received training so that they can use appropriate scaffolding for ELLs. The ENL teacher collaborates with the self-
contained classroom teachers to make sure that the ELL instruction is congruent with their educational plan. As much as 
possible, these students are included in ENL groups with students from mainstream classes, but during Integrated ENL 
instruction they participate in lessons in their classroom. 
       ELLS IN self-contained special education classes, like those in Resource Room and Speech, 
are included in Title III ENL After-school program and develop skills using the Wilson Program, where needed.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
           ELL-SWDs in our school receive both related services and self-contained instruction. Students  receiving related services 
are given support so that they can remain and be successful in regular education classes. Service providers, including the ENL 
teacher, work with the classroom teachers to maximize the support they can receive in their regular classroom by pushing in 
wherever possible. ELLs in self-contained SE classes are sometimes pulled out for ENL service with ELLs from the mainstream 
to meet their needs in the least restrictive environment possible. The ENL Teacher, like the Related Service Providers and the 
Special Education classroom teachers, provides additional scaffolds to make the Common Core curriculum accessible to ELLs 
with Learning Disabilities. Flexibility is exercised in scheduling to balance the ELL SWDs' academic needs as articulated in their 
Individual Education Plans with the goals of integrating them in the least restrictive environment and attaining proficiency in 
English.  Under CR Part 154.2, students are mandated to receive Integrated ENL in their classrooms, so the ENL teacher will 
work with teachers of self-contained SE classes to plan the delivery of that instruction. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
1.  he school has adopted the Ready Gen program for English Language Arts and Go Math for Mathematics. Ready Gen has 
materials to help ELLs and students with special needs to access the program. Go Math has Spanish language books that 
parallel the English edition. Dual Language classes will use texts in both languages to aid Spanish-speaking ELLs in learning 
Math. The Spanish edition of Everyday Mathematics, Matematicas Diarias, our previous core Math text, may be used to give 
more support to Spanish-speaking ELLs. Spanish Language Arts materials include the Estrellitas Program for phonemic 
awareness for Pre-Kindergarten through Second Grade, the Villacuentos Reading Program for Kindergarten through Second 
Grade,AWARD Reading On-line Spanish and Descubre for Kindergarten through Grade 5.  Supplemental classroom 
instructional materials and resources include, but are not limited to: Big Books in English and Spanish, leveled and genre 
libraries in both languages, books on tape/CD in both languages and reference and project materials. These materials are 
aligned with the Common Core Curriculum, featuring a balance of fiction and non-fiction.  AWARD Reading is especially 
important for language learners because it is available in English and Spanish editions.  Dual Language classes have sets of 
AWARD Reading books, audio CDs and CD Roms for their grade level from Kindergarten to Third Grade. In addition, the school 
has purchased on-line licenses for the English levels from Pre-Kindergarten through Third Grade and for Spanish for 
Kindergarten, First and Second Grade levels that can be accessed in class or at home. Smart boards are available for all 
classrooms.             
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

   
In the course of the coming year we intend to expand and refine our use of Project Based Learning enhanced by the resources 
of the Magnet Program. Teachers collaborate across the grade to plan integrated thematic units that include different content 
areas. We especially want to increase projects in STEM and infuse them with the arts. 
A role for the ENL Teacher and Dual Language Teachers in the planning will be to outline the language objectives of each 
project: the oral and written language that students need to develop to accomplish the goals of the unit. The ENL Teacher will 
focus on language needed to develop English proficiency among ELLs, along with the Dual Language teachers, who will plan 
also to develop Spanish proficiency of students approaching these tasks. 
 
Dual Language teachers will also focus on fostering more oral/aural use of Spanish in their classes. Our use of the Descubre 
program from Santillana helps to foster this. In addition, we will begin using Palabras a su Paso to enhance students’ 
understanding of the patterns of Spanish words. This will function as an extension of the phonics developed by the Estrellita 
program. 
 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

PS 46 had a vibrant Transitional Bilingual Education program for more than 20 years. However, the Spanish-speaking ELL 
population declined so that by 2007-2008, we would have only been able to maintain TBE classes in the early grades. At the 
same time, we noticed that the majority of parents of ELLs started choosing the Dual Language option. After considerable 
discussion among the TBE teachers and with parents and the administration, it was decided to begin a transition to a Dual 
Language model in 2009-2010. We began the transition with the incoming Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten classes that year 
and gradually replaced the TBE classes as the children aged. Since then, incoming Spanish-speaking ELL parents have mostly 
selected the Dual Language option, as have the parents of many English Proficient children.  Although we closed the TBE, we 
replaced  it with a Spanish Dual Language program. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 
ELLs are included in all programs that the school organizes, including after-school and extra-curricular activities. ELLs are 
provided equal access to all school programs, in keeping with state law.  PS46 provides an enriched instructional focus for 
monolingual and Dual Language pupils.  Our project-based instructional approach integrates a broad range of specialty classes 
and is adaptable to multiple intelligences.  This inclusive approach is evident from the first days of school when we prepare for 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

Hispanic Heritage Month.  Hispanic Heritage Month culminates in an all-school celebration where the families of all students 
come together, and students from all classes share what they have learned about Hispanic culture and history through art, 
music and writing. 
 
Our state of the art Robin Hood Library offers books and media in English, Spanish and Arabic.  The foreign language library 
holdings foster understanding of American as well as foreign cultures. All students are provided with opportunities to use 
materials from the library. Students can choose books in English or in their native language. A substantial quantity of Spanish 
and Bilingual English/Spanish books are included in the library's collection. In addition, all parents can borrow books for their 
children. The Librarian has received special training in making the Library accessible to the whole school community. 
 
Our award-winning Arts program includes a visual arts teacher who not only links the arts with Science and Math but Social 
Studies as well.  The program emphasizes diversity and multicultural contributions to historical and contemporary arts and 
culture. Highlights include the use of Hispanic artworks as mentor pieces for student projects, and the use of African motifs in 
art for Black History Month.  The Arts Program fosters language growth through non-verbal expression, and contributes to a 
vibrant visual environment for the students. The Art teacher has long experience dealing with a multi-linguistic population, is 
sensitive to the needs of ELLs and is adept at using demonstration and the language resources of more proficient speakers of 
other languages to help less proficient students understand their tasks. 
 
ELLs participate along with their classmates in Music class. Our Music Teacher is developing instrumental and choral music 
programs on a regular basis. In addition, we have an outside partnership to further provide children opportunities to develop a 
musical awareness.  ELLs learn to play recorders along with their classmates in Grades 3 and 4 in a program taught by teaching 
artists from the New York Philharmonic. An awareness and appreciation of different traditions of music is fostered school-wide 
during Hispanic Heritage and African-American History Months. Students learn songs in English and Spanish. 
 
The Town Hall Residency 
 
PS46 continues to host performing arts residencies with The Town Hall. Town Hall teaching artists, in collaboration with 
classroom teachers, plan and coordinate residencies to strengthen the curriculum connections to the Common Core State 
Standards. Student learning is advanced through an arts-based curriculum both incorporated into classroom and as discreet 
instructional practices.  Culminating performances showcase students’ skills to their families. 
 
Enrichment from The Town Hall partnership strengthens sophisticated language development of speaking, reading and writing 
through grade peer interaction and through specialized activities including theater, stagecraft, dance and music. 
 
 
Behind the Book (BtB) 
 
The Behind the Book Program continues to have a residency at PS46.  Every year many of the DL classes participate. BtB 
engages young readers by connecting them to contemporary writers and illustrators with classroom visits. BtB collaborates 
with classroom teachers selecting books to investigate and developing a customized writing curriculum.   The author of the 
selected book teaches a workshop to inspire students.  The culmination is publication of a writing project or illustrated 
book.   The BtB Program increases students’ engagement in reading and improves literacy, and incorporates student artwork. 
 
The program has these goals: 
    • Engage students with reading and writing, increasing literacy skills. 
    • Support a culture of reading in the classroom.  Sustain engagement in reading and writing. 
    • Empower students learning through the creation and sharing of  their original work. 
The BtB Curriculum meets the Common Core Standards. 
 
Physical Education is currently offered by classroom teachers who bring their students to the school’s gymnasium according to 
a regular weekly schedule. Teachers have been given professional development so that they can enhance this essential 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

component of children’s education. Besides its necessity for healthy development, Physical Education affords ELLs rich 
opportunities to learn language in action. The Town Hall Creative Movement dance class along with Tap Dance and African 
Dance in different grades  offer students special opportunities to integrate physical activity and cognitive development. 
 
PS 46 currently sponsors after-school programs to enhance student skills and understanding of test tasks in Reading and 
Mathematics. ELLs can be included along with other students. In addition, we use our Title III grant funds to organize an after-
school program for ELLs from Kindergarten through Grade 5 to further develop basic communication and cognitive academic 
skills. 
 
Extra-Curricular Activities 
ELLs are encouraged to participate in all extra-curricular activities at PS 46.  They are full participants in a number of school 
programs. Currently, these include: 
• The Color Guard, which presents the American and New York State flags at assemblies, and leads the Pledge of Allegiance. 
ELLs and DL  students are members. 
 • The Oratory Contest in which students practice first as a group, coached by the Speech teacher and then compete to 
represent the school in a district-wide competition. 
• The Library Squad, in which  ELLs and other students assist in re-shelving  books and maintaining our excellent Robin Hood 
Library 
• Family Arts Day, our annual celebration of the arts held on the block in front of the school in the spring 
• The Hispanic Heritage and Black History celebrations, which include art, music and dance reflective of our multicultural 
heritage. 
• Movie Night: An evening program sponsored by the Parent Teacher Association several times during the year. 
• 6/27/17Family Fun Night: Once or twice a year all parents are invited to join their children in a mix of enjoyable activities 
including art and music in conjunction with mandated parent-teacher conferences. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 
   
There are several targeted intervention programs that are used. The most important are those that are tied to the Core 
Curricula in Reading and Math. ReadyGen has prepared a series of suggestions for supplemental instruction for struggling 
learners, including ELLs, the Scaffolded Strategies Handbook, which corresponds to the materials for each grade in the Ready 
Gen Language Arts program. The primary Math intervention for Go Math is the Strategic Intervention Teacher Activity Guide, 
which includes activities for Tier II and Tier III groups for each grade, reinforcing the sequence of the main text, and providing 
activities to build the students foundations in Math. 
 
On-line resources, such as AWARD Reading, which entails an interactive resource with a number of levels of difficulty from 
basic phonemic awareness to non-fiction and fiction readings geared to the highest Third Grade level are available for 
intensive interventions for individual students.           
 
 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 
 Native Language Arts (NLA) instruction takes place during the Spanish half of the week. Students receive at least 5 periods of 
Spanish NLA a week. Native Language Arts Materials used include the Villacuentos (Storytown Program in Spanish), Estrellitas, 
classroom libraries and Learning Village. The classroom teacher provides instruction in Spanish Language Arts as well as 
content area instruction - Math, Social Studies and Science - in Spanish. Students are immersed in Spanish during that part of 
the week. Spanish is not only the subject of instruction, it is the medium of instruction.For Spanish-speaking ELLs, this supports 
their development of content area knowledge along with developing their literacy in the framework of their native language. It 
also allows them to become the language experts in the class in relation to their English Proficient classmates. The classroom

environment is print-rich, with a Spanish Word Wall and charts and labelled pictures to provide extensive exposure to written 
Spanish.  The classroom libraries contain a wide selection of fiction and non-fiction books at different degrees of reading 
difficulty. 
Transitional Bilingual Education: 
There no longer is a TBE program in our school. It was replaced by the Dual Language model. 
Stand-alone English as a New Language: 
The medium of instruction in ENL class is English, with support available in the Home Language where possible and 
appropriate. The use of Home Languages is encouraged among students 
where it enhances learning, especially in cooperative groups where at least one member is at the Newcomer or Entering 
level.  The home language is accepted as an oral or written response, although the teacher responds in English and rephrases 
the response in English (if the student speaks a language that the ENL teacher understands). There is no instruction in the HLA 
in ENL class. The ENL Teacher’s role is to provide a good model for English while showing respect for the Home Languages of 
the students.  Students are encouraged to continue to develop their literacy in their home language. Books in the students’ 
Home Languages are available in the school library, the ENL classroom and classroom libraries, to the extent  possible. 
Students are provided with Bilingual dictionaries, where they are available; students in grades   
3, 4 and 5 are provided  with Math and Science Glossaries in their home language, if they are available. Parents are encouraged 
to read to their children in their home language. Books in the school library and the ENL Teacher's library are available for 
parents to borrow in Spanish and Arabic. In meetings with parents of ELLs, the ENL Teacher encourages to use their native 
language as much as possible with their children to foster rich language development. One specific avenue that is stressed is 
reading aloud and story-telling to their children in the Home Language. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

ELLs in the DL program are grouped by their language proficiency but remain with their classmates, so they learn at an age 
appropriate level. They benefit from the consistency of instruction and the ability to develop  
content knowledge in their native language while they develop competency in English. ELLs in the ENL 
program are grouped with students who are close to their ages. In this way the instruction and materials used can be adapted 
to the cognitive abilities of their age range. As per the requirements of the CR Part 154.2, combined grade level  groups are 
restricted to two contiguous grades. 
The ENL service helps ELLs by scaffolding their learning and supplementing their exposure to the Core Curriculum with a rich 
mixture of language approaches. ELLs typically need to build up background in an expanded vocabulary, relying initially on 
visual images and physical objects to make their vocabulary comprehensible. Then they need guidance on developing the 
command of syntax that will help them interpret what they read and encode it for their own writing. 
The appropriate materials and methods depend both on the English proficiency level of  the ELLs as well as their ages. Typically 
new arrivals need a large amount of visual support and frequent repetition of the most common patterns to gain a foothold in 
English.Transitioning and Expanding students also benefit from visual referents for their language but are ready for more 
abstract uses of language. They benefit especially from the use of graphic organizers, the use of sentence stems and 
frameworks and instruction that highlights connecting words and the most widely useful new vocabulary.                       
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 
Our school has been collocated with Fort Greene Preparatory (FGP) middle school for the last several years. Their classes are 
located in the Third Floor. Both schools share the use of the auditorium, the gymnasium, the cafeteria and the school yard. The 
administrations of the schools work closely together to ensure the smooth functioning of the building. 
There are limited, largely informal relations between the staff members of the two schools. The ENL Teachers from our school 
and Fort Greene Preparatory speak about issues affecting our students, especially those few ELLs who move up from our 
school to FGP. In that context we discuss the academic, linguistic and socio-emotional needs of those students. 
           
   
   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 
Students and parents are invited to pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten Open Houses in the Winter and Spring as pre-
registration begins. During the pre-registration process the ENL/Dual Language Coordinator checks the HLIS and interviews 
parents of children with other language exposure to see if they may be in need of testing. Spanish-speaking parents are 
encouraged to enroll their children in the Dual Language Program, as we feel it provides the best environment for their 
children's language development. Parents with children in pre-Kindergarten are included in orientations for parents of ELLs 
prior to moving their children into Kindergarten. Parent orientations organized by the Parent Coordinator are offered for all 
parents both of newly enrolling Kindergarten students and pre-Kindergarten students entering Kindergarten. 
We do not have summer programs for incoming students at this time. 
 
Newcomers during the school year are first assessed with the NYSITELL and Spanish LAB (if they speak Spanish and score below 
the Commanding level on the NYSITELL) to determine whether they need ENL service within their first ten days in the school. 
Spanish-speaking Newcomers are integrated into Dual Language classes immediately if their parents agree. Once they are 
identified as entitled to services, Newcomers are  quickly placed in the appropriate services.             
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

At this time, the only language other than English used for instruction in the school is Spanish in the Dual Language Program. 
ELLs who speak other languages could be considered for places in the DL program, if their parents requested it. So far, we have 
recommended that parents of ELLs who speak languages other than Spanish enroll in monolingual classes to minimize the 
language learning burden for the students. That could change, depending on the child and the parents. We do not have the 
resources to offer another language class.           
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

 
a. The Dual Language (DL) classes are self-contained and heterogeneously grouped. The same teacher 
teaches all subjects in both languages, separating and alternating the languages according to the plan for 
that grade. There is one Dual Language class in pre-Kindergarten and in every grade from Kindergarten 
through Fifth Grade. (In 2016-2017, the DL Fourth and Fifth Grade students were combined in a bridge 
class because of limited enrollments.) 2017 is  the second year that  DL Fifth Grade students have 
graduated.  DL teachers collaborate across the grades. 
Some ELLs at the Entering or Emerging proficiency levels may receive extra support from the ENL 
Teacher. Other than that time, the EP and ELL students are integrated throughout the school day.  All 
subject areas are taught together, with the exception noted above for some students for ENL. 
b. Language Arts, Science, Social Studies and Mathematics are taught in both languages, but separated by 
time. English is the the primary means of presenting Mathematics, as most students will take the New 
York State tests in English. 
c. It is essential for the DL program that the two languages are clearly distinguished, so students can 
develop coherent and consistent models of their different structures and lexicons.  One key dimension in 
which language is separated is time. Our model has changed over the course of the six years that we have 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

been implementing the program according to the experience of the teachers and the needs of the 
students. Initially, we used the roller coaster model for distinguishing the languages, alternating half day 
segments of each language. In the second year of the program, teachers suggested that the alternate day 
model might allow for more consistency in the use of Spanish, so we shifted to that model.  Over the last 
few years we have had further discussions as new teachers have joined the staff, new classes have been 
added and a new curriculum has been implemented. Currently the Pre-Kindergarten class is using the 
roller coaster model, while Kindergarten through Second Grade classes continue with the alternate day 
model, which teachers have found successful. However, teachers of Third and Fourth Grade have been 
concerned about meeting the requirements of the Common Core, so they are using the roller coaster 
model, as they feel that it is more conducive to consistency in the curriculum for their level. We will 
continue to monitor the success of this arrangement. We are mindful of the advantages of consistency 
across the grades for a program like ours, but we also respect the teachers' professional judgements 
about the needs of the children in their classes. 
 
Language is also differentiated spatially. There are separate bulletin boards for Spanish and English, and 
charts are arranged to enhance the distinctions between the languages. Color coding helps make the 
visual separation of the languages clear. Spanish writing is in red and English is blue. As well, the 
classroom libraries are divided so the separation of the languages is clear. 
 
d. Emergent literacy is taught simultaneously, so students learn print concepts in both languages, 
although they may be expected to be grouped according to their ability in the target language and 
English. We find that many students, including EPs, catch basic phonetic concepts more quickly in 
Spanish, especially with the Estrellita phonemics program. They then successfully transfer those skills to 
reading in English.                
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 
.All Teachers are teachers of ELLs, either because they currently have ELLs or they will have ELLs at some point in the future. 
Therefore the entire professional development plan for the school is relevant to teachers of ELLs, and all teachers need to be 
conscious of best practices for supporting ELLs. 
 
The school’s professional development plan is focused on implementing the Common Core Curriculum Standards in all content 
areas. It aims to enhance teachers’ skills in specific realms, such as developing more sophisticated questioning techniques and 
applying the CCLS to all curricular areas. Over the past several years under the Magnet Program our professional development 
has focused on how to improve Project Based Learning to integrate skill development with content learning and how to use 
the power of hands-on learning. Other topics are enhancing instruction in STEM and more use of technology. 
Teachers are encouraged to present what they have learned at workshops outside the school to the broader school 
community. The administration prepares a schedule of Lunch and Learns, regular presentations of turnkey training. 
Teachers also attend workshops in hand-on Science presented by other outside partners like OmniScience, Cookshop and the 
Brooklyn Botanic Garden. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

The sessions are structured in a variety of formats, from presentation to cooperative learning groups. The leaders of discussion 
can be outside experts and/or teacher and administrator practitioners from the ranks of our school staff. 
 
As part of its general program of Professional Development, the school includes topics specific to the needs of ELLs for all 
teachers. Upcoming topics will be the Requirements of the CR Part 154.2, a Report on the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL 
Assessments of ELLs in PS 46, Scaffolding Techniques for CC Instruction, Appropriate Assessment for ELLs, Vocabulary 
Development for ELLs, How to Develop Integrated Instruction for ELLs and Preparing ELLs for the NYSESLAT. 
 
Some PD will be more specific to the needs of Dual Language Teachers. Some topics will include Use of the Estrellita Spanish 
phonics program and ongoing monitoring of Estrellita instruction. We will send some teachers to attend Estrellita refresher 
courses. We have also sent teachers to PD on Palabras a su Paso, a Spanish word study program, and will continue to do so. 
 
There is also a need for training in using the EDL Spanish Reading Assessment. We will explore the possibility of bringing in an 
outside trainer in techniques for increasing oral/aural language use in DL classes. 
 
The Dual Language Teacher Team meets at least twice a month to discuss instruction for ELLs and EPs in English and Spanish. 
This includes assessments, using data to drive instruction, individual student issues, materials and pedagogy. 
 
As in previous years, we expect to organize an ELL Issues Study Group after school with funds from Title III for Professional 
Development. The focus will be on how to develop vocabulary across the content areas. 
 
The ELL Coordinator works with the administration to identify professional development opportunities offered by the NYC 
Department of Education's Office of English Language Learners that would benefit Dual Language teachers, so that their 
attendance can be arranged. 
 
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 
CR Part 154.2 requires  an expanded commitment to ELL-specific training. To comply with the requirement that 15% of the 
total hours for all teachers in topics of second language education, and 50% for Bilingual/Dual Language and ENL teachers, we 
have increased the amount of PD offered in the school, and send more teachers to ELL-oriented PD outside the school. There 
will be a burden on the DELSS and the Borough Field Support Center to provide more high quality PD programs than they have 
up to now. It will also be necessary to keep better records of PD sessions as teachers attend them, so they can be monitored. 
 
The administration keeps a record of all Professional Development offered in the school, and all PD that teachers attend 
outside the building. Agendas for in-house training and attendance sheets are kept, along with an accounting of the amount of 
time devoted to each topic. Agendas are also collected for all training sessions outside the building. The ENL Teacher will work 
with the administration to monitor those records and ensure that the CR Part 154.2 targets are met. 
 
The Dual Language Teacher Team meets regularly to discuss how best to foster ELLs’ English language development and how 
to develop Spanish skills among EPs. The ENL/Dual Language Coordinator keeps agendas and minutes for all those twice 
monthly meetings. 
 
The Speech Therapist regularly receives ELL training in the course of professional development provided by her supervisor. The 
ENL Teacher will meet with her to make sure that she is receiving adequate training in ELL issues. 
 
Other staff members also need to be included in the effort to raise awareness of the needs  of ELLs. Regular collaboration 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

 

takes place between the ELL/Dual Language Coordinator and the Pupil Accounting Secretary, Parent Coordinator and Family 
Assistant to plan for the registration of new students, providing opportunities for the exchange of views and information. The 
ENL Teacher provides these staff members with training on the intake procedures specified in Part V of this LAP. The Pupil 
Accounting Secretary is made aware of training opportunities offered by the DOE on the needs of ELLs and their families. The 
Parent Coordinator (PC) receives training on issues related to ELLs as well. We plan for the PC to attend a Language Access 
Coordinator training in the next year. 
 
The ELL/DL Coordinator meets periodically with the School Assessment Team (SAT) to present data from the NYSITELL, Spanish 
LAB and NYSESLAT and to help them interpret those scores. The ENL Teacher is also responsible for making sure that members 
of the SAT are aware of new developments in relation to ELLs and the intervention and evaluation process, such as the new 
Language Proficiency Team process for determining whether children with learning disabilities are also English Language 
Learners. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
 
Since the 2015-2016 school year, we have been implementing the requirements of the CR Part 154.2 to meet individually with 
all the parents of ELLs to discuss their children’s language proficiency progress as measured by the NYSESLAT and what they 
need to develop further. These meetings are in addition to the parent orientations that we provide to parents of newly 
enrolled ELLs, annual meetings with groups of parents of ELLs and the meetings we have several times each year for parents in 
the Dual Language Program.  
 
The ENL Teacher will coordinate the organization of these mandated meetings with the help of the Parent Coordinator and 
Bilingual Family Assistant, as well as the Dual Language Teachers. We will send out letters with a coupon for return in students’ 
book bags to invite parents to make appointments at their convenience in October. We will follow up with phone calls and e-
mails for parents who do not respond to the letters. The ENL Teacher will maintain a checklist to make sure appointments have 
been made and that they have taken place. A good time for parents to come in would be during the Tuesday afternoon Parent 
Engagement period. If parents can not come in we will attempt to schedule telephone conferences. 
 
The ENL Teacher meets with all parents of ELLs in these individual meetings. Dual Language Teachers will participate in 
meetings with parents of children in their classes along with the ENL Teacher. Where appropriate, other classroom teachers 
may be included in meetings with parents of children who are not in Dual Language classes. Dual Language Teachers will be 
able to handle interpretation and translation with Spanish-speaking parents (the ENL Teacher also speaks Spanish). If 
interpretation and translation are needed for other languages we will seek help from community members and the Translation 
and Interpretation Unit. 
 
The ENL Teacher will be responsible for maintaining a record of these meetings with parents  as part of the Parent Contact Log 
that he maintains. 
           

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

 
PS 46 has a Parent Coordinator(PC), Ms. Cecelia Lopez, who communicates with the parents and the community. The PC’s role 
in the building is to help maintain a welcoming atmosphere for all parents and provide services based on the school 
community’s parental needs. This is tailored with the support of volunteers and parent members of the School Leadership 
Team and Parent Teachers Association. 
 
 As well, the Parent Coordinator  maintains a continual flow of ongoing supports to parents and keeps parents aware of the 
services that exist throughout the city that are geared toward ELLs and their needs.  The PC has organized English Language 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

 

Tutoring for parents who do not speak English and provides referrals to ENL classes for adults such as the Good Will Beacon 
program available in the community. Finally, she helps communicate parent concerns to the school administration. 
a.             
Parent Workshops 
In order for parents to assist their children academically and socially, the school offers parents various opportunities for 
growth and development. Workshops on curriculum, health, school rules, regulations, policy and services are conducted by the 
PC and community-based organizations affiliated with the school. Examples are: 
•  Parent Workshops on the Core Curricular Standards, ARIS, Parent Compact, SLT, Title 1, and Parent Involvement are given in 
Spanish and English. Should parents who prefer the other languages of the school (Arabic, Bengali and Haitian Creole), we will 
arrange either for over- the- phone interpretation through the Language Line or by an bilingual adult member of the 
community. 
Other workshops include: 
•    Getting off to a good start (parents learn who’s who in the building) in September. 
 •   How to set up a homework work station . 
 
Parents are invited to contribute from their cultural background during the school’s major cultural celebrations such as 
Hispanic Heritage Month and Black History Month. 
The Parent Coordinator has worked with Teachers to offer family workshops during the regular Parent Engagement Period on 
Tuesday afternoons. Teachers have led workshops during this time on using art and music with children to foster creativity and 
enjoyable learning. Other topics have included presenting the expectations and content of the Core Curriculum to parents; one 
teacher has had a regular workshop for parents every week on topics from his grade curriculum. 
In addition, group meetings are scheduled at least three times a year for all parents of children in the Dual Language program 
and once or twice a year with all ELL parents. 
 
Parent Communication 
All parent school information is offered in English and Spanish at the present time. Phone messages, fliers and notices are sent 
out in Spanish and English. An in-house translator translates letters, documents, and flyers into Spanish, the native language of 
most of the English Language Learners in the school.  The school arranges for the translation and distribution of information in 
other languages as needed. The Language Access Coordinator has developed a plan to expand translation of documents in the 
other languages of the school with the Translation and Interpretation Unit. (See Translation and Interpretation Policy 13k046, 
2017-2019) When parents have meetings in the school concerning their children, interpretation is provided by staff members if 
the language is Spanish. If parents speak another language, schools staff members arrange interpretation either by the 
Translation and Interpretation Unit’s Language Line or an adult member of the community.  
 
The ENL/Dual Language Coordinator meets with the parents of newly enrolled ELLs to orient them to programs available to 
help their children, and organizes periodic meetings with parents of ELLs throughout the year to report on the programs for 
ELLs and to discuss their concerns. In addition, meetings are scheduled on a regular basis for all parents of children in the Dual 
Language programs. 
 
Parents of ELLs are integral members of the school community, participating in all school activities including: 
• Parent Teacher Association: Some past officers of the PTA have children in the Dual Language Program and can translate for 
Spanish-speaking parents at meetings. 
• Learning Leaders Program 
• Parent /Teacher Conferences 
• Assemblies and Curriculum Celebrations 
• Some Title I Committee members are parents of ELLs.

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
Continuity in the Dual Language Program 
 
We emphasize the importance of continuity in the development of Spanish language skills. If parents have to move their children to 
another school, we encourage them to find a school with a Dual Language program. For Spanish-speaking ELLs, developing 
competence in Spanish literacy will continue to foster all-around academic performance. English Proficient  students also benefit 
from the enrichment of learning Spanish. We are fortunate that a nearby middle school, MS 113, has opened a DL program this 
year. We have encouraged parents of our Fifth Grade students to consider continuing in DL education through Eighth Grade by 
enrolling their children in such a program. We are happy that many of our graduates did that in the first year of the program. We 
have heard that they are doing well, and they tell us that they enjoy being able to extend their education in Spanish. Even 
graduates who are not continuing in a DL program in middle school tell us that they are continuing in Spanish classes (which they 
find too easy.) 
 
 
Technology and Dual Language Program 
 
•               Technology is being used as a vehicle for enriching the Dual Language program, as well as  ELLs who are in monolingual 
classes, by assisting students develop other visual and alternate strategies for learning.  Technology is integrated into all curriculum 
areas.  
•               All classes are being enhanced through the use of Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Inspiration, Kid Pix, AWARD Reading and 
Internet research, including the making of books and publishing to enhance student celebration of literacy skills in both English and 
Spanish. Students are taught to make iMovies as part of making presentations. Teachers use Smartboards regularly in all classes. 
•               Students engage in research programs to enhance inquiry-based learning. 
•               The school has an active computer laboratory with Internet access and a multitude of software programs which enrich 
students’ computer skills. 
                  Every classroom in the school from Pre K through grade 5 has computers (2 – 4) and a printer in the 
classroom.  Smartboards are available for use in all classrooms. The school has been fully wired with LAN access in every classroom 
and cable TV access in specified rooms on each floor. Each grade shares a cart with tablets that students are taught to use in 
various applications.   
Students, staff and parents have multiple opportunities to use technology to demonstrate support of their learning. 
 
Sustainability and School Garden 
 
                 PS 46 was recognized for our unique all-school effort to transform trash into utilitarian and beautiful objects such as 
jewelry fashioned from discarded water bottles and Do-It-Yourself low-cost non-toxic cleaning wipes.  DL classes are integrated 
across the board in these efforts and in some cases have led the various projects. Our school has won several awards for these 
projects, including the Golden Apple Award in 2013. 
Using some of the prize funds we rolled out a small school garden during the spring of 2014. We have been able to continue it into 
2017 with a grant from City Growers.  We envision a pocket garden of flowers, herbs and vegetables being grown by PK, K and 1st 
grades, including the DL classes of those grades. 
We have worked with the Brooklyn Botanic Garden to obtain curricular materials in Spanish to deepen the children’s hands-on 
Science learning in both languages. Schoolyards that feature natural areas foster increased knowledge retention, creativity and 
academic achievement in youth.  As with our other enrichment and specialty offerings speaking, reading and writing for ELLs is 
broadened and deepened through authentic engaging activities. 
 
      Magnet Programs Integrating Arts and STEM 
 
Students in PS 46, including ELLs,  have been fortunate to be part of the school’s Magnet program. Some of our outside 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

partnerships were mentioned earlier in Part IV #11, Access to School Programs. Other outside partners that have collaborated with 
our classes, including Dual Language classes, are the Salvadori Center, Marquis Studios, Cookshop and Flowcabulary. Some of these 
providers have come during the regular school day and others have led after-school activities. 
 
The Salvadori Center has brought engineering, architecture and design projects into classrooms. Students have learned how to 
design buildings, bridges and skate parks. Marquis Studios has  engaged students at different grade levels in puppetry, storytelling 
drama and even an African marketplace. Through Cookshop, students have been part of hands-on explorations of fresh fruits and 
vegetables. Flowcabulary has organized a Big Idea Week for the Fourth Grade in which several Brooklyn Inventors and 
Entrepreneurs explained their  work process to students and then coached groups of students as they developed their own ideas 
for products, made prototypes and gave presentations demonstrating their products. The DL class did some of its work in Spanish 
and Newcomers from the class gave a presentation in Spanish to an assembly of the Inventor/Coaches and the whole Fourth 
Grade. 
 
In this environment  ELLs have had ample opportunities for language development and higher order thinking.- 
 
Although 2017-2018 will be the first year after the termination of the Magnet Grant, the school staff has been trained to sustain 
the activities and we have been seeking resources and partners to facilitate that.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Karyn Nicholson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We use every available means to determine the language background and needs of parents as they enter the 
school. Spanish has historically been the major second language in our neighborhood, so Spanish-speaking staff 
members are assigned to assist every Spanish-speaking parent enrolling a child to assess their needs. The 
Language Access Coordinator participates in the major registration process to ensure that all families speaking 
other languages are properly identified. Other pedagogues also assist parents during the registration process, as 
every parent must be interviewed to determine the Home Language. 

 

HLIS: The Language Access Coordinator (LAC) works with the Pupil Accounting Secretary to process all Home 
Language Identification Surveys (HLIS) of incoming students to identify the home language of each child and the 
language preferences of all of the parents. As parents are asked to indicate the language in which they would like 
to receive oral and written information from the school, the Pupil Accounting Secretary records the information

and enters it into the school’s data system. Subsequently, the LAC can note which families need to receive 
translations and interpretation, and which languages. The LAC works with the Parent Coordinator (PC) to make 
this information available to the Administration and teachers. 

 

Language Needs Survey: Parents of children entering our pre-Kindergarten program complete the 
Language Needs Survey, which is very similar to the HLIS and includes questions to determine the parents’ 
preferred language for oral and written communication. 

 

ATS Reports: The home languages of all students are available in the Place of Birth Report (RPOB) and can 
be grouped according to language. The Adult Preferred Language Report (RAPL) lists all parents and 
guardians and their preferred languages for oral and written communication. The Home Language Report 
(RHLA) summarizes the information derived from the HLIS and the RCPL provides analysis of the data. 

 

Other sources: Parents also indicate home languages when they complete Emergency Contact Cards. The 
Pupil Accounting Secretary has had training on parent language needs and she knows to inform the LAC or 
the PC if parents need language assistance. 

 

The Parent Coordinator and the Family Assistant act as interpreters and liaisons with Spanish-speaking 
parents. In addition, classroom teachers and other school staff members are alert to the language needs 
of parents. They are encouraged to inform the LAC and the PC when they encounter parents who need 
translation or interpretation. Many staff members speak Spanish and convey the needs of our large 
number of Spanish-speaking parents. 

 

The Language Access Coordinator and Parent Coordinator maintain records of information from all of 
these sources to form the clearest picture of the language needs of parents of children in the school. 

 

As can be seen in the data table below, Spanish continues to be the second most used language among 
parents in the school community. About 25 % of the parents prefer Spanish as a means of oral and written 
communication. Three other languages are preferred by some parents: Arabic, Bengali and Haitian Creole 
in that order of frequency. Each one is preferred by about 1% or less of the parents. 

 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In case of an emergency with an individual student, or any kind of injury, a school staff member contacts the 
individuals listed on the emergency contact card. In the case of children whose parents have limited English abilities, 
an effort is made to make use of the preferred language indicated on the HLIS form or the Emergency Contact Card. 
For Spanish-speaking families, contact is made through a Spanish-speaking staff member, either a pedagogue, the 
Parent Coordinator, Family Assistant or a school aide. If the preferred language is another language, a call will be 
placed through the Translation and Interpretation Unit’s Language Line with an interpreter in the appropriate 
language if no staff member has been identified who can interpret the call. Finally, if there are adult English-speaking 
members or friends of the family, their help may be enlisted. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 

The Language Access team will provide training sessions for all staff members in which they will explain the school’s 
Translation and Interpretation Policy, the data on the school’s population and the importance of improving 
communication with parents with limited English skills. The LAC will give professional development to the school’s 
Professional Learning Community in September on the latest school Translation and Interpretation Policy. The LAC will 
distribute the Language ID guide and the Language Palm Card. Teachers will also be reminded how to use the 
Language Line interpretation system and how to submit documents for translation to the Translation and 
Interpretation Unit. (A similar presentation was given this year after the LAC training.) 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78 

 

Other staff members who interact with parents, such as the Parent Coordinator, the Pupil Accounting Secretary, 
Family Assistant and the Safety Agents will also be introduced to the resources available for assisting parents who rely 
on another language, including the signage and the language identification cards. 

Since most of the parents in our population are Spanish-speaking, and a number of our staff members are as well, the 
LAC will identify those able and willing to assist with translation of documents and interpretation of meetings. The LAC 
will also ascertain if there are staff members who speak any of the other languages in the school community. 

 

 
  

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The DOE’s official language identification cards are displayed in the main office and on the security desk. Newly 
enrolling parents are offered the pamphlet on translation and interpretation resources. The Translation and 
Interpretation signs in the nine most common languages in the DOE are displayed at the entrance to the school. A 
section on the Translation and Interpretation Policy will be included in the school handbook, written in the languages 
of the school (English, Spanish, Arabic, Bengali and Haitian Creole). Spanish-speaking staff members who are 
responsible for assisting parents with interpretation will be introduced at parent meetings. 

 

In addition, the school website will incorporate information about how to access language resources in the nine main 
languages. A letter will be sent home to parents announcing the translation policy early in the year. A LAC will visit all 
kinds of parent meetings to explain the policy. 

 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We gather feedback from parents in a number of different ways. The first and foremost is through teachers who 
report issues that have been brought up to them by parents. The Language Access Coordinator becomes familiar to 
parents during the registration process and has frequent contact with parents throughout the year, allowing for 
feedback. The Parent Coordinator, LAC and Administration also monitor PTA meetings, workshops, Parent Teacher 
conferences and Dual Language meetings. Staff members are alert to the language needs of parents attending school 
events. We encourage participation of parents from other language backgrounds and try to assess what barriers may 
exist to their taking part. We will consider taking a survey of language minority parents this year to see how they feel 
about the services we provide.
