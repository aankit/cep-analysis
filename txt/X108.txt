Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

P.S. 108 Mission Statement is to foster optimum achievement of students by empowering them with knowledge and 
the skills necessary to succeed in a complex global society. Our vision is to provide a comprehensive, rigorous, 
exciting, educational program with an emphasis on literacy and mathematics development that is aligned with 
Common Core Learning Standards. Guided by the principles of learning, students are challenged to think critically. 
Inquiry, analysis, problem solving and decision-making are integral parts of an educational program that allows 
students to achieve individually and cooperatively. Our collaborative spirit seeks to nurture and support the whole 
child. Through academic and artistic endeavors students develop self confidence, tolerance, and independence while

celebrating similarities and diversity. Educators and parents support efforts to increase student’s access to 
information with a growing emphasis on technology. P.S. 108 recognizes its responsibility to prepare students not 
only for the next level of education but for the many challenges facing productive citizens of an ever-changing society. 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S. 108 is located in the Morris Park section of the Bronx. It is a neighborhood that faces the challenge of integrating 
a large number of immigrant families from diverse countries into an existing, well established community. Our 
student body is a microcosm of this multi-ethnic community. Many families relocate within two to three years.  

Our school population currently consists of 599 students in Grades Pre K - 5. There are (17) general education classes, 
(6) integrated and collaborative team teaching classes, and (2) self-contained bridge classes. School demographics 
are: Asian: 11.17%, Black: 5.41%, Hispanic 43.15%, White: 38.07%. In addition, 12.35% of our student population 
receives EnL services and 15.91 % Special Education Services. 

P.S. 108 enjoys collaborations with community based organizations such as the Morris Park Association, Bronx House 
and the YMCA. The Ferkauf Institute of Yeshiva University offers free evaluations and counseling services to our 
students. We recognize that in order to meet the diverse needs of our students and families of this community, the 
role of the school has to expand. 

 

P.S 108 continues to perform above district, borough and city performance levels on the New York State ELA and 
Math Exams. The same is true for Grade 4, New York State Science Exam.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

P.S. 108 is recognized by NYS as a school in Good Standing for the 2017-18 school year  As a result of rigorous 
instruction, collaborative teachers and effective school leadership, P.S. 108 made a 5% gain in English Language Arts 
as measured by New York State ELA assessment for the 2016-2017 school year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Areas of Strength: Teachers are highly qualified and work collaboratively to create dynamic CCLS aligned integrated 
units of study combining Social Studies, Literacy and Science. Teacher teams revised a unit using the Tri-State 
Curriculum Rubric and "backward design" (UbD) to assess multiple entry points for all learners including SWDs and 
ELLs. Teachers completed ELA and Social Studies standards audits to ensure all standards were taught throughout the 
school year. Weekly common planning meetings facilitated by the Literacy Consultants, grade leader, and 
administrators provide teachers with an opportunity to align their instruction horizontally and vertically, including 
Looking at Student Work, to target student development and ensure work products demonstrate high cognitive 
challenge. In addition, the school schedule provides teachers with an opportunity to meet daily to coordinate their 
instruction, discuss student work, and/or monitor student performance. Technology is embedded in daily instruction 
including the use of research-based programs to target individual student needs. 

Area of Need: Improve student outcomes in Reading for grade two students based on the analysis of the 2017-18 
Fountas and Pinnell reading levels. 61 % of grade two students are performing on or above grade level in reading. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Goal # 1: Improving Student Outcomes and School Performance (Rigorous Instruction).  

By June 2019, 66% of grade two students will perform at levels 3 and 4 as measured by Fountas and Pinnell benchmarks.

Needs Assessment- Supportive Environment 

Areas of Strength : Through systematic school-wide screening, the RtI team assesses students (3) times/year and 
shares that data with teachers, parents, administrators, and support staff. Respect for and among students is evident 
in classrooms through accountable talk, collaboratively created class rules and consequences as well as individual 
behavior trackers. The Child Study Team meets bi-monthly to address specific students through a collaborative 
process that includes student work samples, teacher reports, family background, and social/emotional health. School 
Counselor provides classroom workshops on various social/emotional development topics throughout the school 
year. The NED Show presents a character development show for students in the fall. School Counselor works with 
groups of students as needed, to address various social/emotional development concerns. Teachers embed character 
development lessons into the school day. Students are recognized for Citizen of the Month characteristics, Service 
Squad, Student Government, and perfect attendance. Faculty and staff annually discuss school beliefs including 
social/emotional development and supporting students. School nurse trained all staff on Epi-Pen protocols and 
educates parents on various health issues as they arise. Extracurricular activities available to students include Project 
Boost, Inside Broadway, PTA-sponsored school dances, YMCA, and Ballet Tech. The School Leadership Team meets 
monthly to address school-wide issues and develop action plans to address all stakeholders. A PBIS program will be 
fully implemented for the 2017-2018 school year. 

Area of Need: Increase student attendance rate as a result of the following 2017-2018 attendance data: 10 students 
severely absent, (below 79.6%) 103 students are chronically absent, (80-89%) 49 students borderline attendance, 
(90%-90.6%)

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Areas of Strength: Teachers have collaboratively created dynamic CCLS aligned integrated units combining Social 
Studies, Literacy and Science and revised a unit using the Tri-State Curriculum Audit to assess multiple entry points for 
all learners including SWDs and ENLs. Teachers are participating in ongoing professional development in backward 
design. Weekly common planning meetings facilitated by the Literacy Consultants, grade leaders, and administrators 
provide teachers with an opportunity to align their instruction horizontally and vertically, including Looking at Student 
Work , to target student development and ensure work products demonstrate high cognitive challenge. In addition, 
the school schedule provides teachers with an opportunity to meet daily to align their instruction, discuss student 
work, and/or monitor student performance. DRAs are administered three times a year and running records are 
conducted on a monthly basis to assess student progress in reading. Math unit test data is tracked monthly and daily 
quick checks are used to inform small group instruction. Flexible small group instruction occurs daily in reading, 
writing and math based on multiple data points and progress is monitored within small groups daily. Exit slips are 
used to determine student understanding of the concept/skill taught. EngageNY math tasks are incorporated into 
grades 3-5 to provide multiple entry points in math. Technology is embedded in daily instruction including the use of 
research-based programs to target individual student needs. Additionally, students participate in enrichment daily 
which provides an opportunity for student choice.  

Areas of Needs: Teachers require additional training in oral language reading and writing strategies to continue to 
address the ever increasing ENL and SWD's populations. . 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 108, Philip J. Abinanti School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title 
I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community.  

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 
P.S. 108, Philip J. Abinanti School, will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
At P.S. 108, we provide a supplemental ENL program before and after school for a total of 25 
ELLs in grades 2-5. The program is designed to support beginning and struggling ELLs with 
English acquisition and ELA skills. We use data from the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT to 
identify ELLs in need of extra support as well as NYS ELA test data. Data analysis includes all 
of the following: identify students at the entering, emerging, and transitioning proficiency levels 
; identify students who have not progressed at least 1 proficiency level per school year; identify 
students who have regressed 1 or more proficiency levels and identify L1 and L2 students. Once 
students in need of extra support are identified, administration then articulates with the ENL 
teachers and classroom teachers to discuss instructional plans, best practices, and strategies to be 
implemented in the before and after school programs. 
Both before and after school programs begin in October and run through April each school year. 
Our before school program begins at 7:15am and ends at 8:15am, held Monday through 
Thursday (4x per week), totaling a number of approximately 80 sessions. Our after school 
program begins at 2:45pm and ends at 4:15pm, held Wednesday and Thursday (2x per week), 
totaling a number of approximately 40 sessions.  
One state certified ENL teachers provide ELLs with direct instruction in English, employing 
the New Language Arts Progressions (Bilingual Common Core Initiative ) 
and SIOP methodologies and strategies. Home language support is provided through use of 
translated texts, bilingual dictionaries, and Imagine Learning (ELL computer 
program).  Students are organized into subgroups according to English proficiency level and 
reading level. One certified ENL teacher is assigned to teach one class in the before school 
program for students in grades 3-5  (15 students in total). One certified ENL teacher and one 
certified Common Branch teacher are assigned to co-teach one class in the after school program 
for students in grades 4 and 5 (20 students in total). The student to teacher ratio is 10-1 for both 
before and after school programs.          
The instructional materials utilized by teachers in the program are Continental's Finish Line 
Bilingual Common Core workbooks, Mondo Let's Talk About It, EngageNY Common Core 
resources, and Lee and Low leveled readers and lessons. Learning activities that students are 
engaged in during before and after school programs include the following: speaking, listening, 
reading, and writing activities differentiated according to language proficiency level and reading 
level per subgroup; learning tasks that include photographs, pictures, charts, diagrams, and 
translated texts; oral language development activities from Mondo Let's Talk About It.    
Program notification letters for before and after school programs are provided to parents in both 
English and in their home language. Our ENL teachers are responsible for translating all school 
documents to parents' home languages. Both ENL teachers and Common Branch teachers 
employed in the before and after school programs are responsible for maintaining all student 
records, including attendance. All home-school correspondence is kept on file in an ENL binder. 
Administration provides a computer generated list of students in each program and attendance is 
recorded daily. Teachers are responsible for communicating student attendance issues, such as 
tardiness and absences with administration. Both administration and teachers work together to

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
We currently have two state certified TESOL teachers, Nicol Pirrazzi and Erica VanPatten, as 
well as Literacy consultants that will provide ENL and oral language professional development 
to all teachers (grades K-5) ongoing PD sessions (at minimum of two times a month) will be held 
throughout the school day, during other professional work and after school professional 
development time at 40 minutes duration. In addition to monthly ENL PDs, our two 
certified TESOL teachers will support all teachers of ELLs throughout the school year during 
common planning periods that take place once per week. All records of ENL PD provided for 
our staff at our school, including staff attendance and topics/materials covered, will be 
maintained by our two certified TESOL teachers named above and kept on file in an ENL PD 
binder. 
ENL professional development is focused on the specific language, academic, and cultural needs 
of our ELL population. The ENL teachers will provide teachers with current ENL methodologies 
that employ Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) techniques and strategies using 
the Bilingual Common Core New Language Arts Progressions. During professional development 
sessions, teachers actively engage in creating language objectives and incorporating 
SIOP components into currently existing lessons and units of study while using the Bilingual 
Common Core New Language Arts Progressions as a guide. ENL professional development at 
our school is designed to positively impact the progress of our ELL population as 
follows: ELLs will have equal access (as their English speaking peers) to the curriculum and 
realistic and fair opportunities to meet grade level Common Core standards through the 
implementation of specifically designed lessons. These lessons include clear detailed language 
objectives, SIOP strategies and methodologies, and differentiated and scaffolded small group 
instruction (Bilingual Common Core scaffolds). Our goal is to provide the instructional support 
needed for all ELLs to progress across the English proficiency levels as they acquire the English 
language.  
Through ENL PD, all teachers of ELLs will develop a better understanding of their individual 
ELL students and how to best support them through the use of the above stated ENL best 
practices. In addition to monthly ENL PDs, our two certified TESOL teachers will support all 
teachers of ELLs throughout the school year during common planning periods that take place 
once per week. The rationale for ongoing ENL professional development is to provide teachers 
with the tools they need to continuously and consistently support ELLs throughout the school 
year and to provide them with appropriate learning opportunities which enable them to progress 
across the English proficiency levels as they acquire the English language.   
Our two certified TESOL teachers will receive ongoing ENL PD as they are scheduled to attend 
one ENL PD per month provided by the NYC DOE. Administration and teachers are made aware 
of all upcoming NYC DOE ENL PDs via NYC DOE email. ALL ENL PDs, including in-house 
and out-house are at no cost.

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
Parent Engagement for parents/families of ELLs takes place every Tuesday from 2:40-3:55pm 
beginning in October and ending in June (approximately 35 sessions in total). Our certified 
TESOL teacher, Nicol Pirrazzi, engages families in the following ways: provides English 
instruction; assists parents with helping their children with at home learning activities/projects; 
assists parents with community outreach (networking and available resources); informs parents 
and assists them with navigating the NYC DOE website and the resources available to them in 
their home language. 
The rationale for Parent Engagement is to engage parents/families of ELLs in a welcoming and 
warm manner that makes them feel included and comfortable to interact and engage in their 
home language while simultaneously supporting their own English language development. 
Parent surveys are distributed in English and in parents' home languages during our initial Parent 
Engagement session in October in order to gather important information needed to assess the 
needs of our parents. 
In addition to ENL Parent Engagement, we aim to provide parents/families with the support they 
need to assist their children with English acquisition and overall academic progress as well. We 
currently have 2 ENL Parent Workshops scheduled in the evening (approximately 2 hours per 
workshop) for the months of December and April. The workshops are designed to inform parents 
in English and in their home language (interpreters and translated materials provided) of the 
NYS ELA, Math, and NYSESLAT exams. The workshops will provide parents with sample test 
content and questions, including demonstrations of strategies and activities they can practice at 
home with their children. Parents will participate and engage in activities in English and in their 
home language through a test simulation model so they are exposed to and can experience 
firsthand what their children are expected to do.    
Parents/families are notified of all ENL Parent Engagement events/activities and ENL Parent 
Workshops that take place at our school through letters that are translated to parents' home 
languages and sent home. In addition, workshops are listed on the parent coordinators website as 
well as the school website. Our ENL teacher Nicol Pirrazzi and Parent Coordinator Tabitha 
Brugman follow up with letters and notifications that are sent home by making phone calls 
home. All records of home-school correspondence including letters, notifications, parent 
attendance and participation during ENL Parent Engagement and ENL Parent Workshops are 
maintained by Nicol Pirrazzi and Tabitha Brugman and kept on file in an ENL binder.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses a variety of tools to access the early literacy skills of our ELL students. To support out English Language 
Learners, the following early literacy assessment tools are used: 
 
Benchmark NYSESLAT Simulation in the Fall for grades K-5 
Periodic NYSESLAT Simulations in the Winter and Early Spring for grades K-5  
Mondo Reading Assessment is administered in the Fall for Grades K-2 
Oral Language Assessment, Grades K-2 
Mondo Phonics Assessment for letter and sound recognition and phonemic awareness, Grades K-2 
The Diagnostic Reading Assessment (DRA) is administered in the Spring and Fall to grades K-5 to assess reading comprehension 
and fluency. 
Integrated Units Baseline Writing and performance task (writing analysis) assessments are administered to grades K-5. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

Fundations Phonics Unit Assessments (K-2) 
 
Both Mondo and DRA assessment results are aligned to Fountas and Pinnell levels to assist teachers in creating small guided 
reading groups and targeted instruction. Students in grades K-5 are administered ongoing running record assessments to track, 
and monitor progress. The data informs our instruction plan by allowing us to identify and group students based on their 
academic and linguistic needs not only in the classroom but also for related services such as AIS, RTI, ENL and if necessary 
special education services to provide more targeted and strategic support. In addition, students who are identified as in need 
of support are also invited to an after school ENL program and extended day programs in Math, Literacy and/or Science. 
Teachers use all assessment data to inform and drive instruction.      
 
Insights that our assessment data provides about our ELL population include the following:  
 
As a general rule, ELLs at the Entering and Emerging language proficiency levels struggle to meet grade level standards in 
reading and writing due to limited English proficiency, however, ELLs at the Transitioning and Expanding proficiency levels 
generally either meet grade level standards or are approaching them. 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Administration allots time during the school day for classroom teachers to administer and score formative assessments 
throughout the school year. Classroom teachers are provided with ongoing professional development and support from 
administration, ELA coach and Mondo consultant before, during, and post administration. Administration and our ELA coach 
distribute an assessment schedule to teachers and strictly monitor the complete testing process.   
 
Our ENL teachers and classroom teachers use assessment data to inform instruction. During a scheduled common planning 
period 1x per week, ENL teachers and classroom teachers collaboratively plan lessons that include the following ENL supports: 
multiple points of entry included in mini-lessons; differentiated/modified learning tasks and teacher created 
assessments; SIOP methods and strategies; implement learning scaffolds from the Common Core Bilingual Progressions.    
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Our school evaluates the success of our ENL program largely by examining standardized test data collected from NYSESLAT, 
NYSITELL, ELA, Math, and Science assessments. Success is measured on these exams when students progress 1- 2 levels. 
Additional evidence of success also includes ELL benchmark and periodic assessments, content unit assessments, and teacher 
created performance assessments.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once data is gathered from summative assessments, administration, our ELA coach, Mondo consultant, AIS and RTI teams 
support both ENL teachers and classroom teachers. First a meeting is scheduled to analyze and discuss the data and begin 
preliminary planning. Planning includes multiple steps needed to supports ELLs so they are able to progress and move up 
proficiency levels. These steps include the following: incorporate multiple points of entry in lesson planning so ELLs have 
access to curricula; establish language objectives aligned to content objectives and CCLS; differentiate instruction in content, 
process, and assessment through the use of Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) and New Language Arts 
Bilingual Progressions; small group scaffolded instruction based on proficiency levels; periodic NYSESLAT simulation 
assessments 3x per school year. 
 
In addition, supplemental Title III funds are used as instructional interventions that are provided to ELLs during our ENL 
morning program (before school) 3x per week and our ENL after school program 3x per week.    
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

 

Our school has an RTI team and all teachers use the RTI framework to guide instruction for ELLs throughout the school year. 
We gather and organize assessment data collected from various assessments and maintain all records using data binders that 
are located in every classroom. Administration, RTI and ENL teachers, and all service providers have easy access to data and 
collaboratively work together to create instructional plans and set goals for ELLs. General Education teachers provide small 
group scaffolded instruction for ELLs in the classroom (Tier 1). The ENL teachers and RTI team work closely with classroom 
teachers using SIOP, New Language Arts Bilingual Progressions and ENL methodologies and strategies to support English 
language development (Tiers 2 & 3). 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
2016 NYSITELL data reveals the majority of our new ELL admits tested in grades K- 5 performed at the  Emerging and 
Transitioning levels. 2016 NYSESLAT data reveals the majority of our ELLs tested in grades K- 5 performed at the Transitioning 
and Expanding and levels. 2016 NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data combined indicate that on average the majority of our ELLs are 
progressing 1- 2 language levels per school year. NYSESLAT data indicates that the greatest rate of progress occurs with 
younger students in grades K-2 in the areas of listening and reading. In general, our ELLs in grades K-5 need more targeted 
support in Reading and Writing and in achieving Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALPS). We use this data to inform 
instruction accordingly (noted in #5). 
 
ELLs in grades 3-5 who are eligible to take the NYS ELA exam, on average, scored at a level 2 in 2016. Data indicates that some 
ELLs at the expanding proficiency level scored at a level 3. ELLs in grades 3-5 who take the NYS Math exam, on average, scored 
at levels 2 and 3 in 2016. Data indicates that some ELLs scored at a level 4. As expected, data indicates that the higher the 
student's English language proficiency level, the higher they scored on both NYS ELA and Math exams.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ENL and classroom teachers receive support from administration, our RTI and AIS teams, and our ELA coach. Team 
meetings are held throughout the school year to analyze data and devise instructional plans (noted in #5). In addition, we use 
EDAT to program students for Integrated ENL in specific subject areas and we use EDUR to ensure that all ELLs are 
programmed in STARS according to their proficiency level and receive ENL support for the required amount of instructional 
minutes. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our ELLs are serviced in a freestanding ENL program incorporating a push in and pull-out model with both 
homogeneous and heterogeneous language proficiency groups serving ELLs in grades K-5. ELLs receive instruction in 
English with TESOL certified teachers using a push in and pull out model. When employing the stand-alone pull out 
model, ENL teachers pick up ELLs from their mainstream classrooms and bring them together for small group English 
instruction with 5 -10 students per group. Instructional activities implemented in our stand-alone pull out model 
include English language practice using all 4 language modalities. Our ENL teachers use Finish Line English Practice and 
NYSESLAT workbooks to supplement teacher created lessons that employ SIOP best practices and the New Language 
Arts Bilingual Progressions.     
 
ELLs are placed in 2 mainstream general education classes per grade (K- 5). 81 ELLs spend the entire day in all English 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

content area instruction with native language support such as bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, translated texts 
and peer scaffolding. Our ENL teachers push into classrooms to provide integrated ENL instruction employing 
somewhat of a co-teaching model with the general education classroom teacher. While classroom teachers deliver 
the mini-lesson, ENL teachers provide multiple points of entry and provide scaffolded small group instruction. Lessons 
are planned in advance 1x per week during our common planning period and they include 
differentiation/modifications for ELLs.     
 
As per CR 154.2 students at the Entering proficiency level will receive 360 min. of ENL instruction per week. 180 of the 
360 min. is Stand- Alone ENL instruction and the remaining 180 min. is Integrated ENL instruction. Students at the 
Emerging proficiency level receive 360 min. of ENL instruction per week. 90 of the 360 min. is Stand- Alone ENL 
instruction and the remaining 270 min. is Integrated ENL instruction. Students at the Transitioning proficiency level 
receive 180 min. of ENL instruction per week. 90 of the 180 min. is Stand- Alone ENL instruction and the remaining 90 
min. is Integrated ENL instruction. Students at the Expanding proficiency level receive 180 min. of Integrated ENL 
instruction per week. Students at the Commanding proficiency level receive 90 min. of Integrated ENL instruction per 
week for an additional 2 years upon testing out.                 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

n/a 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

n/a 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Our pupil accounting secretary and ENL teachers communicate multiple times per day to ensure that all newly identified and 
continuing ELLs are scheduled in STARS for the required amount of instructional minutes per proficiency level. Our pupil 
accounting secretary, administrative staff and ENL teachers create a spreadsheet of the mandated instructional minutes per 
student according to their proficiency level as determined by their scores on the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL The amount of 
Integrated ENL and Stand Alone ENL is based on their proficiency level as outlined in CR Part 154 regulations (noted in #1a). 
Our pupil accounting secretary, administrative staff and our ENL teachers schedule, record and provide mandated instructional 
minutes per student. Instructional minutes per student is closely monitored by administration throughout the school year.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Our ENL teachers and general education classroom classroom teachers use both SIOP methodologies and the New Language 
Arts Bilingual Progressions to make content accessible and comprehensible for ELLs in grades K- 5. Core content is delivered by 
both our general education classroom teachers and our ENL teachers. Our ENL teachers always include language objectives in 
lessons and use a variety of scaffolding techniques such as front loading and previewing the academic vocabulary, building 
background knowledge, using gestures and visual cues such as pictures and videos.  Instruction is differentiated in every lesson 
to match the needs of ELLs at all stages of language acquisition. Semantic webs are used in addition other graphic organizers to 
support students' comprehensible input of difficult text. Furthermore, sentence stems are used to support student with 
cognitive functions such as comparing and contrasting, inferring, etc.  This will ensure their active participation in the lesson 
and provide multiple points of entry into the curriculum. The ENL teachers share these methodologies and best practices with 
mainstream teachers. This opportunity for cross-articulation is provided during common plan time once a week for a 40 
minutes. The ENL teachers use data from these meetings, in addition to curriculum maps, to inform instruction and decision-
making. All students are engaged in making meaning of complex text and instruction is focused on developing their academic 
language. Additionally, students are offered bilingual books in Albanian, Spanish, French, Chinese, Russian, Korean and 
Vietnamese/English to read and to listen to (on CDs) that are comprised of the following genres, folktales, fables, fairy tales, 
fiction and nonfiction content area glossaries, as well 50/50 split fiction, nonfiction CCLS. We use Go Math aligned with CCLS at 
our school and  the homework (review) is translated by the company into Spanish. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Once a student had been administered the NYSITELL and the results indicate that he/she is entitled to English language 
services, he/she is administered the Spanish LAB if the home language is Spanish. All ELLs  entitled are provided with translated 
versions of state math and science tests, in-person interpreters contracted by BigWord, and bilingual glossaries. Based on our 
ELL population, the testing coordinator requests these tests in the appropriate languages. ELLs in grades 3-5 who have a home 
language of Spanish or Chinese, for example, are offered the translated version to use side-by-side with the English version. 
They choose the version in which they wish to record their answers. For low incident languages for which there are no 
translated versions of the tests, an interpreter is contracted ahead of time from BigWord. We have most recently used 
Chinese, Albanian, and Arabic interpreters for testing. ELLs are also provided with bilingual literature from Lee and Low 
publishers in the following languages: Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, French, Russian, Korean, Albanian, and Vietnamese. Some of 
the books are on CD as well so students can listen. Some of the literary genres include folktales, fables, fairy tales, biographies, 
and historical fiction.     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Our ENL teachers and classroom teachers differentiate instruction in each content area for every lesson. Instruction is tailored 
to meet students' needs when teachers differentiate the content, the process or the product. Differentiated instruction 
includes but is not limited to the following: targeted word study in all content areas accompanied by photos, diagrams, and 
translations; New Language Arts Progressions for scaffolded instruction; SIOP methodologies and strategies incorporated in all 
content area lessons (such as Close Reading, Chunking Text, Stop and Jot, Think, Pair, Share, Turn and Talk, Think Aloud) ; 4 
language modalities (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) targeted in all lessons; students are provided with multiple 
options (according to language proficiency level) to demonstrate learning; curricula is supplemented with Continental ELL 
workbooks (leveled) that target phonics, grammar, and vocabulary; all ELLs spend approximately 100 hours per week using 
Imagine Learning software to develop language skills.             
 
5a. We currently do not have SIFE students, however In order to make language and content comprehensible to SIFE students, 
we would employ various strategies to support their English language acquisition. SIFE students would receive sheltered 
language instruction that is modified to make content comprehensible.  Teachers tap into  students' prior knowledge and use 
visual/audio materials, a variety of manipulatives, graphic organizers, and collaborative learning activities.  Students are 
encouraged to use cognates from their native language.  Bilingual glossaries and dictionaries are available.  There is explicit 
instruction during the school day in phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, and fluency through the use of Fundations and 
Mondo phonics intervention. This provides students with opportunities to build oral language and early literacy proficiency.  In 
addition, it helps accelerate students' reading comprehension and builds vocabulary.  Students use Imagine Learning (English 
computer software program) as well as web-based programs such as Starfall, Brain Pop, Tumble books, etc.  SIFE students 
would be paired up with a language buddy for help translating classwork, directions, and other pertinent day to day activities. 
SIFE students would be encouraged to attend the Extended Day Tutorial program in addition to the mandated ENL services 
they receive throughout the school day. SIFE students are also entitled to participate in the Title III program. 
 
5b. ELLs in school less than three years (i.e. Newcomers) represent the majority of our ELL population. Newcomer activities 
involve partnerships in small group work and fostering peer socialization and language support. Language development and 
learning is accelerated through the use of visual aids (photo cards, realia, etc.). Language is modeled through role play and 
demonstrations such as think- alouds.Through peer and teacher interactions, students are provided many opportunities to 
develop oral language proficiency in the new language. Vocabulary is explicitly taught and materials are adapted to meet the 
language and learning needs of students.  Newcomers are also encouraged to give oral and written responses in their home 
language and picture dictionaries and glossaries are provided. An additive learning environment is fostered where students' 
native culture is recognized and valued. Meaningful learning activities that value students' cultural backgrounds are provided. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 
5c. We currently have a very small percentage of ELLs receiving services 4 to 6 years. Our plan is to teach with clearly defined 
content and language objectives. Our ENL teachers provide authentic activities that integrate lesson concepts with language 
practice opportunities such as letter writing, summarizing, and research-based writing. Students are taught to recognize 
cognates, and signal words. Words are defined and highlighted in content words walls. New academic vocabulary is explicitly 
taught and there are multiple modalities and opportunities for students to use Tier 1, 2, 3 words. Teaching methods include 
previewing, modeling and demonstrating, reviewing, assessing and re-teaching. New information and abstract concepts 
become concrete when both teachers and students create and use graphic organizers, create and play games for content 
understanding and review, create semantic maps, etc. Teachers plans for multiple learning styles, and incorporate video, film, 
posters, songs, web-based programs, charts, timelines, photos, etc. 
 
5d. Occasionally, we have a Long-Term ELL who has been held over, and has received 6 years of ENL services.  This is usually a 
student whose disabilities limit his/her ability to achieve Proficiency on the NYSESLAT. This student will be in an ICT class or 
receive SETSS. Our ENL teachers will articulate with the LPT, including the Special Education teacher, and together they will 
create an action plan with instructional objectives/strategies, and use data to drive the plan. The student is often proficient in 
listening and speaking, but requires intervention instruction in developing reading, writing and problem solving skills. As per 
CR part 154 students who do not make adequate progress will receive additional supports such as RTI and AIS. If necessary, 
the student will be referred for additional instruction. 
5e. We provide testing accommodations to former ELLs for up to two years after attaining proficiency on the NYSESLAT. 
Former ELLs are also invited to participate in Title III extended day school programs. As per part 154, students who are at the 
Commanding proficiency level will receive 90 minutes of ENL services for 2 additional years. Teachers modify their lessons and 
differentiate tasks according to student proficiency levels and student specific data. 
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Administration ensures that all teachers implement a provided checklist of best practices/strategies to support ELLs- SWDs. 
Some of the instructional strategies implemented are SIOP, Stop and Jot, Think, Pair, Share, Turn and Talk, and Think Aloud. 
Teachers also provide sentence frames and develop clear, “student friendly” language objectives. All teachers use UDL 
strategies to assist the children. Each classroom has listening centers with cds. Every ELL student has a password and uses 
Imagine Learning for a minimum of 30 min per day. To support students with disabilities, we use an RTI approach. Students 
who have been identified as having special needs receive supplemental services (in English with home language support) from 
related service providers using Wilson or Fundations. P.S. 108 has a Speech teacher, Physical Therapist, Occupational 
Therapist, Guidance Counselor, Psychologist, Social Worker and Family Worker. There is cross- articulation between our ENL 
teachers and related services providers, and the ENL teachers complete reports as requested, attend Annual Reviews, Child 
Study Team meetings and other meetings regarding ELL-SWDs. The Language Proficiency Team (LPT) will now be responsible 
for determining if students who have (or are suspected of having) a disability should be initially identified as an ELL student 
and receive bilingual or ENL services. Furthermore, the LPT will determine on an individual student basis how to best evaluate 
an ELL student with special needs. 
        
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our special education coordinator and ENL teachers articulate regularly to ensure that ELLs- SWDs receive instructional 
support to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the least most restrictive environment. Our ELLs- SWDs 
receive support from a licensed Special Education teacher, a licensed Common Branch teacher, and a licensed ENL teacher in 
inclusion classes (mainstream and special education). We promote an inclusive learning environment. Through creative 
scheduling and class programming, the school is able to provide the required number of mandated services to meet the 
diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least most restrictive environment. ELL-SWDS attend a homeroom daily. They participate 
in special classes:  Science, Art, Technology and Physical Education (weekly). ELL-SWDs are supported with the Imagine 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

Learning program within the context of their classrooms. Students are always placed in the most restrictive environment here 
at P.S. 108. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our school’s RTI and AIS teams collaborate with all teachers to test and identify all students including ELLs who are in need of 
intervention services in ELA and Math. We use the three tier system. In Tier One the students are served by their classroom 
teachers. The teacher then creates small focus groups based on data and teacher observations. Throughout the school day, 
teachers employ a variety of grouping configurations: whole class, pairs and focus groups. The data from RTI as well as other 
assessments assist the teachers in creating small focus groups. The classroom set up encourages collaboration, provides 
practice opportunities and increases the preferred mode of instruction for students. Ongoing informal assessments ensure the 
groups are fluid and adequate We use Wilson and Fundations to support students with decoding and making meaning for 
literacy. In addition, our school’s ELA and Math coaches support classroom teachers and the RTI and AIS teams. Our Go Math 
program provides differentiated instruction for ELLs. Our science program- demonstrations and content related video clips are 
used to scaffold instruction for ELLs.  In science we provide scaffolded instruction as well  to make concepts more accessible to 
students. We use Brain Pop videos to teach science concepts. The students are also engaged in experiments using Foss kits 
which allows them to make scientific concepts concrete. We also offer a 4th grade after school Science Sleuths 
program.  Strategies such as wait time (20 seconds) are employed by all teachers for ELLs to formulate responses. Although the 
language of instruction is English, we use bilingual paraprofessionals, teachers, and peer buddies to clarify concepts, build 
vocabulary and assist with procedures. If it is determined that a student is entitled to Tier 2 and 3 services then that service is 
provided by RTI instructors. All services that are available to general education monolingual students are also available to ELL 
students if they are in need of them, such as Speech,  At risk counseling etc. These services are provided in English. Extended 
day programs in ELA and Math are also offered to ELL students in grades 3- 5. Extended day programs for ELLs only are offered 
in grades 2-5 for support in English acquisition, ELA and Math. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

The following new programs and/or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year: 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

n/a 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All of our ELLs in grades K-5 are afforded equal access to RTI and AIS programs throughout the school day. All before and after 
school programs offered between the months of October and April are afforded to all students including ELLs in grades 2-5. In 
addition, Winter and Spring Break programs for Math and ELA are offered to all ENL students in grades K-5. Our school offers 
before and after school enrichment programs in ELA, Math, Science, and ENL. All students, including ELLs, are strongly 
encouraged to attend. In addition, notifications of special events, trips, activities and programs such as Boost, After school, AM 
Extended Day, Inside Broadway, Science Sleuths  etc. are distributed to all students (grade appropriate). Teachers working in 
these programs encourage ELLs to use glossaries and dictionaries, often provide translated texts and engage in scaffolding and 
differentiation to ensure understanding and completion of activities as they do during the regular school day.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our school uses the following instructional materials to support ELLs: teacher- created ELA/S.S. units of study based on 
NYS CCLS; EngageNY; NYC DOE Social Studies and Science Scope and Sequence; Mondo oral language reading and writing 
activities; Continental ENL workbooks; Lee and Low bilingual literature; SunBridge ENL literature; Mondo literature; ReadyGen 
literature; Reading A- Z digital literature; RAZ- Kids digital literature. Imagine Learning ENL software program is used for a 
minimum of 30 min. daily. Realia as well as access to the internet (every classroom has at least four laptops or desktops and 15

Ipads), bilingual glossaries, and dictionaries are available to students. In addition, first year ENL students in grades 1-5 are 
given a one year subscription to Rosetta Stone, an English language learning software students can use in school and at home.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Students’ home languages are supported through the use of translated texts and key vocabulary with picture representations. 
All school memos and school- home correspondence are translated for ELL families. In the freestanding ENL program we 
employ at P.S. 108, home language support is delivered by providing dictionaries, glossaries and bilingual or monolingual 
books in home languages. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Our administrative staff, special education coordinator, ENL teachers, service providers, and all classroom teachers ensure that 
ELLs receive the support and mandated minutes of instruction. All required services, support, and resources always correspond 
to the age and grade levels of our ELL population. Administration ensures that all resources offered are always age 
appropriate. Some of the resources provided to students are as follows: Fountas and Pinell leveled books; RAZKids leveled 
digital library; Lee and Low bilingual leveled readers; teachers provide some translated texts within ELA/S.S. Units of Study; 
picture dictionaries for younger students and/or beginners, bilingual glossaries with photos for older students or more 
advanced ELL students.

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Administration, our pupil accounting secretary, parent coordinator, ENL teachers, and guidance counselor work as a team to 
assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year and throughout the school year. Our team assists students 
and families in the following ways: completing school documents; providing translation and interpretation services; holding 
parent orientations; Parent Engagement scheduled every Tuesday; ENL Summer Program (Title III); provide summer learning 
packets to reinforce language skills.      
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Our school does not currently offer language electives.    
 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our ENL teachers provide professional development for all ELL personnel once each month. Professional development for the 
2017-2018 school year will include the following: reinforcement of CR 154.2 ; Language Access Handbook & Tool Kit Review; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

Translation and Interpretation Unit Review; New Language Arts Bilingual Progressions and CCLS alignment and 
implementation; SIOP implementation (emphasis on language objectives and learning scaffolds/differentiation); 
NYSESLAT preparation; ELLS- SWDs best practices and strategies; Oral language reading and writing best practices for ELLs. All 
classroom teachers, service providers, and paraprofessionals attend our in-house ELL professional development 1x per month.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 
 
Administration encourages and supports the ENL teachers and all ELL personnel to attend in- house and out- house ENL 
professional development throughout the school year. Administration informs all faculty of DOE professional development 
opportunities. Professional Development is also offered to teachers of ELLs here at P.S. 108 as they engage in Common Core 
learning Standards and New Language Arts Progressions with our ENL teachers, ELA coach and with the consultants 
of Mondo and Aussie. Our ENL teachers and assistant principal meet on a biweekly basis to plan. 
Administration distributes Professional Development binders to all staff members at the beginning of each school year. The 
professional development facilitator always presents a typed agenda and attendance sheet. As per CR 154.2, 15% of the total 
hours of professional development for all teachers will be ELL- specific (monthly in- house PD provided by ENL teachers). As 
per CR 154.2, the ENL teachers will attend and receive out- house PD for 50% of the total hours. Throughout the school year, 
our ENL teachers and selected classroom teachers of ELLs attend DOE professional development at various sites designated as 
well as 2-3 RBERN (national level) workshops.           
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our Administrative staff, ENL teachers, and parent coordinator work as a team to schedule individual meetings with parents of 
ELLs throughout the school year. Every Tuesday is dedicated to Parent Engagement where parents are invited and encouraged 
to come to school to meet with teachers to discuss their child's learning goals and progress. These meetings are scheduled to 
discuss the goals of our ENL program, individual student progress, and language proficiency assessments and results. 
Provisions for translated documents and interpretation services are made in advance when there's a need so that LEP parents 
fully understand and have access to the program and an understanding of their child’s development. In addition, our ENL 
teachers provide 2-3 parent workshops designed specifically for families of ELLs. The parent workshops may include some of 
the following topics: Become familiar with the community and available resources for immigrant families; How to support your 
child at home with ELA, Math, English acquisition, test preparation.          

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Administration, ENL teachers, and our parent coordinator collaborate to plan special events that foster parent involvement of 
our ELL population and their families. Our ENL teachers maintain and file all pertinent documents including agendas, parent 
attendance and participation sign in sheets. All documents and records are kept on file in an ENL binder in the main office. 
Events include a beginner/intermediate English class for parents and other adult family members that takes place every 
Tuesday afternoon during Parent Engagement. During parent engagement we hold small celebrations for various 
holidays/special events throughout the school year. We plan a large multicultural festival event each spring where ELL parents 
volunteer to share, present, and inform faculty and students about their unique cultures. Students and families perform 
dances, sing songs, play instruments, share poetry/stories, and share ethnic foods specific to their culture. In addition, we 
schedule 2-3 academic workshops for ELL parents. The workshops are designed to inform parents of specific curricula content, 
learning standards, and strategies to assist them with supporting their children at home.

As part of our translation and interpretation services to parents/families, we employ BigWord to provide in person interpreters 
for events mentioned above and during parent teacher conferences as needed. Our ENL teachers and LAC collaborate with 
teachers and have pertinent documents translated to home languages as needed. The provided NYC home language welcome 
and identification poster is clearly posted in the lobby entrance of our school as well.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Charles Sperrazza, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In order to assess the language preferences of parents for both written and oral communication, our 
administrative staff, ENL teachers, and pupil accounting secretary have conversations with parents/families very 
early on in the school year during the admissions process for school registration. The Home Language 
Identification Survey (HLIS) that parents complete when registering their child, asks parents or guardians to 
identify the language in which they would like to receive school communications: written translation and oral 
interpretation. The HLIS is given to parents in their native language. Parents also complete the Parents’ Preferred 
Language Form, available for download from the Translation and Interpretation Unit. The school community is 
informed of their rights to translation/interpretation services in a posting in nine languages at the entrance to our 
building. In addition, our administrative staff, pupil accounting secretary, ENL teacher, and parent coordinator 
assess the language preferences of our parent community in the following ways: initial conversations during 
student registration procedures; interviews and assistance with Home Language Surveys; Parent Orientation 
meetings; Parent Surveys. Once information is gathered, our ENL teacher/Language Access Coordinator creates a 
spreadsheet to organize and track each parent’s language preference for both written and oral communication 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

between home and school. Our ENL teacher utilizes the Language Access Handbook and Tool Kit and the NYC DOE 
website to provide families with translation and interpretation services as needed. All home/school letter 
correspondence is translated to accommodate each parent’s language preference. Over-the-phone and on-site 
interpretation services are provided as needed as well. In addition, we conduct questionnaire surveys, and hold 
parent orientation meetings several times per school year.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

certain languages are available in house and staff will be trained how to use the over-the phone interpretations. The 
Translation and Interpretation Unit for written communication to parents is used in our lower incidence languages. 
When turn around time is not an option, we attach a statement in the parent/guardian language : "This is an 
important document regarding the education of your child. Please have it translated for you promptly."  

These procedures will be monitored by the ENL teacher, LAC, and school administration. In addition, the LAC will 
turnkey additional trainings if attended and will review these procedures with staff on Election Day Professional 
Development.

Our administrative staff, ENL teacher, and parent coordinator collectively work as a team to ensure that the identified 
parents receive the translation and interpretation services needed. We adhere to and utilize the Language Access 
Handbook and Tool Kit and the NYC DOE website to fulfill all parental notification requirements and needs. The 
provided Welcome Poster has been posted inside the front entrance of our school building. The Language ID Guide 
has been posted at our school’s security desk. The Parents’ Bill of Rights and Parents’ Guide to Language Access are 
both distributed during our initial parent-teacher conference scheduled this year on 09/13/16. The ENL teacher 
ensures that all parents who are unable to attend the initial conference receive both notifications during our Parent 
Orientation meeting.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our administrative staff, ENL teacher, and parent coordinator collaborate to create a parent survey that is distributed 
once in the Fall and once in the Spring. In addition, we have ample opportunities to speak with parents in person 
throughout the school year and we make it a priority to encourage feedback on the quality and availability of 
translation and interpretation services provided. Once feedback is gathered, we assess our effectiveness in providing 
parents with a range of quality services. We make it a priority to make necessary adjustments/improvements as 
needed.
