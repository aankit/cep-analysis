Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

If we improve the instructional expertise of our teachers around effective student 
engagement strategies, with questioning and discussion skills, and checking for 
understanding, then instruction will be strengthened and students will learn in deeper 
and meaningful ways. 
Students will be highly engaged with intellectual and purposeful tasks and activities in and 
outside the classroom. Teachers will use data from periodic assessments to inform their 
instruction including grouping strategies and individualized learning tasks suitable to the 
cognitive level of students. 

Students will learn via better development and implementation of hinge point questions 
and class discussions that lead to higher-level thinking. Teachers will build their capacity to 
develop, pose, and provoke questions that will promote higher-level thinking and more 
class discussions and check for understanding. 
Rigorous Instruction is built with collaborative teachers working together with coaches 
and administrators to increase student achievement with benchmarks and indicators 
tied to instructional core. 
Domain 3, competency B of Danielson Framework for Teaching 

Domain 3, competency C and D of Danielson Framework for Teaching 
A successful classroom requires a strong curriculum—aligned to the Common Core— that 
challenges students, scaffolds their experience, and is enlivened by teachers who are 
engaged with their craft. The curriculum must meet students where they are and 
customize inclusive, motivating instruction. Rigorous instruction aligns practice and 
content to Common Core strategies within and across grades (vertical and horizontal 
planning). Students will learn by doing: crafting questions, discussing content to build 
skills as they grow intellectually, socially and emotionally. Artifacts will lead students to 
question content and reach new meaning and conclusions. These artifacts will be part of 
evidence needed to answer problems or driving questions posed in projects. Artifacts will 
have rubrics to assess student work and provide feedback.

Rigor at U. S. A. is defined as students analyzing and applying new information by building on prior knowledge. The 
teachers are aware of student strengths and areas of growth and each student is challenged to move to the next level 
of the Rigor Matrix. Students at U. S. A. have multiple opportunities to access the lesson and contribute to the class 
discussion and show their understanding.  

The U. S. A. teachers meet and discuss curriculum, assessment, pedagogy, and social-emotional supports during 
common planning time via content and grade teacher teamwork. The teachers also discuss the incorporation of 
Common Core learning standards (C. C. L. S.) and the Danielson Rubric. This allows teachers and administrators to 
discuss expectations for the above and define common language across classrooms. The teachers at U. S. A. come 
with a wide range of experiences, so we can differentiate our support for teachers based on their current capacity. 
Our capacity building is multifaceted and aligned to student learning outcomes. Teachers work collaboratively with 
each other and administration to reach school goals via grade and content teams. Advisory “Rounds” take place once 
a week to prepare students for future career goals using iMentor and Peer Group Connection (P. G. C.) using a social 
emotional learning curriculum which promotes weekly contacts with mentors. We focus on social emotional learning, 
via partnership with Center for Successful Schools, via our peer group connection where juniors mentor the freshmen.  

We have begun to use the Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy with Webb’s Depth of Knowledge (rigor matrix) as we develop 
tasks, assignments, and artifacts for our projects and classroom instruction. Most tasks and assignments fall in first 
two levels of the rigor matrix. We have had some extended thinking and reasoning at times in different parts of lesson 
or curricula. Our teachers use either exit slips or Regents' questions to assess instructional outcomes at the end of the 
period. We also use some Assessment for Learning practices like entry or exit slips, hinge-point questions, and peer 
revision strategies to check for understanding. We believe and practice ongoing professional development that is 
continuous and job embedded to improve students learning outcomes as evidence by our agenda and minutes with 
outcomes for common planning time and inquiry team meetings. Teachers work with coaches, Principal, and Assistant 
Principals to align pedagogy to student data and needs. We analyze data to inform instruction and plan to constantly 
make adjustments to our curricula.  

We are a project based learning school which means we use driving questions, anchors and artifacts to ascertain what 
students are learning and what next steps they should take in our student goals. Students use these projects to create 
knowledge and meaning. Our hands-on approach to learning allows students to practice what we teach . Students 
who struggles (general ed., special needs, or English Language Learners) are given tutoring after-school (per subject), 
and during our Saturday Academy. We have science laboratory make-up during the week. Our four year college and 
career plan starts our 9 th graders with resume and cover letter creation and college trips. Our college trips to St. 
John’s University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences or New York University College of Dentistry have allowed 
students to learn information about entrance requirements, S. A. T. scores needed, and types of courses students 
should take. We align all our activities to our community manifesto, vision, mission, essential skills document, 
common language protocols, student support plan, literacy plan, and our grading policy. The instructional core is 
fortified with our projects and hands-on learning experiences.  

Parents are involved in all facets of the school, from parents’ association meetings, college workshops, piano recitals, 
school shows and student trips. Parents call and visit the school on daily basis to ask questions, talk to teachers, 
guidance counselor and administrators. Parents accompanied us to Ramapo for Children cohort retreat week-ends at

beginning of year. This helps school bond and allows for student to leave city and connect with their peers and feel 
special.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

At U.S.A we have a range of special student populations including students with disabilities, English as a new language 
students, and students who are designated with both. Based on their individualized education plans, we provide 
students with Integrated co-teaching setting, counseling service, speech or other related services. Students who 
require ENL services are provided push-in ENL instruction and a Read 180 intervention course if needed. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

We have improved in the culture and trust area. Our staff felt that more supports via professional development and 
learning geared to job embedded practices like data analysis plans, student engagement strategies and problems of 
practice is energizing their work. They felt their voices were heard in terms of school policies, ordering systems and 
curricula. Parents felt that teachers and staff did more outreach this year. This allowed for students to get adults that 
were motivated and focused on their academic, and social emotional supports.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Goal: Increase the use of highly engaging tasks and activities by 100% of teachers to increase student learning 
outcomes in all classrooms by end of June 2019.  

 

The focus will be on improving instruction for the 18-19 school year will be around the Common Core learning 
standards especially in English,math, global, and the sciences based on data collected. We will work on improving 
student learning outcomes on both Living Environment and Common Core Algebra I Regents. Our freshmen (Cohort 
2021) only had 40% passing Algebra Regents in June 2018. Only 54.44% of our sophomores passed Geometry Regents 
in June 2018. We will focus our efforts on the new transition Global History and Geography Regents for 10 th graders 
as well. We had a 45.24% passing rate on Global Regents in June 2018.  

Additionally, we analyzed the N. Y. C. performance assessment data and the diagnostic data from September and 
October 2018 for Algebra I, which showed patterns and trends of questions students need to work on especially 
visualizations to make connections with mathematics concepts and word problems. The math team has decided to 
focus on multi-step problems as their problem of practice. The mathematics team used diagnostic and baseline 
results from teacher created diagnostic and N. Y. C. Performance Assessment to set student goals. We have joined the 
Algebra for All initiative to build our teaching capacity to help close instructional gaps with our mathematics students 
with math connections, problem solving and literacy integration as our focus.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By August 2019, Union Square Academy for Health Sciences (U. S. A.) will have 15% receive a 75% or better on the Living 
Environment Regents Examination and 70% passing the Living Environment Regents in Cohort 2020. 

By August 2019, Union Square Academy for Health Sciences (U. S. A.) will have 80% pass the Algebra I C. C. L. S. Regents 
from Cohort 2019 and 80% from Cohort 2020.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

1. For Living Environment, Earth Science and Chemistry, the item 
analysis of questions with copies of old Regents examinations 
using REDS reports will help us pinpoint student deficiencies 
with tutoring and small group instruction taking place after-
school and on Saturdays.  

2. We need to infuse more literacy into our Living Environment, 
Earth Science, and Chemistry courses focusing on vocabulary 
building, writing lab reports and constructed response question 
prompts.  

3. We will monitor how many labs are completed by students via 
word document. This should dramatically increase the number 
of students eligible for the Regents and also the passing 
percentage.  

4. The science content team will develop programs that 
encourage students to succeed in laboratories. This will be 
overseen by Assistant Principal or Principal.  

5. In 2018-2019, science teachers will create a system of 
reporting students who are not succeeding in labs and creating 
action plans tied to learning targets for each candidate for Living 
Environment, Earth Science, Anatomy, Advanced Placement 
Biology and Chemistry Regents.  

6. Science teachers will report students who are not succeeding 
to the Assistant Principal after each marking period. An 
intervention program will be developed. 

P. M. School will be begin in September to address students that 
failed courses in semesters one or two.  

7. We will work with students in temporary housing to connect 
them to social services via our social worker and provide them 
with books, school supplies and necessary items.  

8. We will have monthly workshops in addition to parents' 
association meetings to model, demonstrate and field questions

language learners and students with disabilities. College financial 
aid and application workshops will be offered as well.  

For Common Core Learning standards Algebra I students, we will 
use Carnegie Learning to set up adaptive tiered assignments for 
struggling mathematics students. This blended learning 
approach will use texts and computer adaptive to address the 
need of our English Language Learners and students with 
disabilities need for learning to identify patterns in math 
problems in order to answer the procedural steps to solve 
equations. It is common core aligned which will help us focus on 
key standards that students need to master to succeed on C. C. 
L. S. Algebra Regents in January 2018 and June 2018.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As in 2017-2018, teachers will meet in 2018-2019 in content and grade teams to analyze data, align curricula to 
current Common Core standards and transition to Next Generation standards, work on Danielson competencies, 
conduct Kids Talk using A. L. S. U. P. strategies from "Lost at School", revise curricula, discuss best practices and work 
collaboratively on school projects. This was successful in that it helped us conduct inquiry cycles to analyze school 
trends and patterns and revises our initial plans. They used teacher identified problems of practice to analyze student 
work around targeted instructional strategies that built student stamina, persistence with content knowledge and 
skills attainment.  

The school uses a uniform template for unit plans in all content areas that include the Common Core State Standards, 
some Blueprint for the Arts and Next Generation standards, domain specific vocabulary, instructional strategies; 
project based learning, use of technology, resources for the unit and professional resources for the teachers, learning 
targets, lesson studies, unit instructional plans and assessments aligned to the standards, and questions developed 
using Depth of Knowledge Framework. For example, a review of a unit of study in science, grade nine shows teaching 
strategies such as; think-pair-share, oral presentation and peer assessments expected to be used in the unit. 
Additionally, the unit evidenced the reading standards for literacy and the technical subjects addressed in the unit 
plan emphasized college and career readiness for all students.  

The school has developed curriculum maps for all content areas in all grades and has made strategic decisions in their 
revision and adjustment process to emphasize coherence and higher order skills across grades and subject areas. The 
leadership shared curriculum maps for grades nine through twelve demonstrating the adaptations and revision 
process for alignment and coherence for writing and English literature. Teachers collaborate on a weekly basis to 
analyze students’ data and make informed decisions on revisions of curriculum maps. Teachers and the leadership 
ensure that driving questions are written across the grades in all subjects and lesson plan templates are uniform and 
used by all when planning. After an analysis of the writing data, teachers decided to begin the writing units with 
graphic organizers across the grades and to align and adjust the rubrics to be more specific to the writing tasks. The 
school obtained state approval for our C. T. E. pharmacy technician and dental technician program. These 
certifications allow students to enter the world of work after completion of courses and passing certification 
examinations tied to work based internships and be eligible to meet C. D. O. S. standards.  

Students’ work in classrooms visited and tasks reviewed during students’ interviews across all content areas 
evidenced alignment to the Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Standards. In addition, tasks 
evidenced rigorous habits and higher order skills and instructional strategies are made to ensure access to the 
curricula. For example, a ninth grade English task asked students to write a medical case study after reading “The 
Bluest Eye”, using textual evidence and medical terminology learned in a previous lesson. A tenth grade task engaged 
students in analyzing some of the errors that may occur when processing a new prescription and evaluating 
prescriptions and patient profile to determine if the prescription should be filled. The tasks evidenced higher order 
thinking skills and promote college and career readiness.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As stated by the leadership and teacher teams, across classrooms, teachers use uniform mid-term and final 
assessments for each trimester. Each content area includes curriculum maps and assessments aligned to each unit of 
study. The assessments are given in the form of projects with artifacts. These exams are administered three times per 
year and students are responsible for completing two projects per trimester. Additionally, teachers use the results of 
the data to revise and add instructional strategies to ascertain academic achievement. Teachers and guidance 
personnel take the information gathered through the analysis of the data and create success plans for each student. 
The plan for success includes: reasons why the student failed the marking period, specific skills and content on 
curriculum maps where student is struggling, personnel at the school level and at the home contacted to inform, and 
strategies that will be used at the school level to support the students to achieve academic success.  

School leader and staff ensure that the curricula are aligned to the Common Core State Standards and the content 
standards and strategically integrate the instructional shifts across grades and subject areas. Academic tasks offer all 
students including English language learners and students with disabilities access to rigorous and engaging learning 
experiences.  
Impact  
As a result, the school curricula decisions ensure coherence across grades and rigorous tasks that 

support high levels of student thinking and promote college and career readiness for all students we will raise our 
College and Career Readiness Index in 2018-2019 by 2%.  
  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By end of 2018-2019 school year principal will work with leadership team to improve school culture and ensure staff 
feels and believes cohesively on vision and mission of school by building trust, creating more reflective dialogue and 
professional learning with 85% of staff.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
All Union Square Academy for Health Sciences teachers are fully certified in their content areas or T. E. S. O. L. or to 
teach students with disabilities. Some teachers are dual certified. We work in grade and content teams to build 
teacher capacity tied to student learning needs and data. We utilize our grade common planning teams, which 
includes days for common core integration, common assessment development, curriculum mapping to standards and 
project based learning to build teacher capacity. Teachers use team meetings to analyze student data, behavioral 
plans, plan inter-visitations, goal setting, plan school culture, and to align projects to standards using rubrics for 
assessments.  

 

During grade and content teacher team meetings, we use the bottom third of students in our school to analyze next 
steps to elevate their skills and meet their individual needs. This conversation leads to development of skills for all 
students via success plans tied to student work and data gaps. All curriculum maps and unit plans are tied to lesson 
planning to provide total instructional alignment. Teachers work with administrators to approve courses and credit 
values aligned to rigorous common core standards. New teacher mentor ship is offered for all new staff. We also work 
with Algebra for All to build teacher capacity and content mathematical knowledge. We will work on building student 
study skills via preparations and adaptations in all curricula to prepare students for Advanced Placement courses as 
detailed our vertical planning maps.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
---Algebra for All coach works with administration on a weekly basis to improve observations and feedback as we loop 
feedback to teachers. 

---Advanced Placement for All coaches will work with teachers and administrators to align all our courses to career 
and college readiness standards in preparation for students to take advanced placement courses.

---Professional development for administration to train their eye to enhance observation feedback via talent coach 
and central workshops is provided. 

---Professional development for faculty to improve teaching by reviewing Danielson framework and observing (video 
or peer observations) lessons to critique. This will allow teachers to be more aware of quality teaching practices with 
feedback from colleagues and administrators. 

---Next Generation standards trainings will continue with Manhattan borough support center.  

---Teacher leaders will work to turnkey, norm each competency and conducts a lesson study with teachers around 
that lens after summer trainings. They will use student work protocols like Atlas to move teacher analysis of data and 
student goal setting.  

---Each teacher works on annual goals at preliminary meetings each September followed with mid-year and end of 
year benchmark meetings to see where additional supports are needed. These are recorded on Google drive in 
teacher's individualized professional learning plan.

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

The school uses common assessments and rubrics aligned to the Common Core State Standards to determine 
progress towards curricula goals and provide feedback to students regarding their academic achievement. A review of 
portfolios during classroom visitation and conversations with students showed evidence of the use of rubrics and 
feedback given to students to advance their learning. Furthermore, students were able to articulate the purpose of 
the rubrics and checklists and they were able to explain the written reflections on work that they wrote based on the 
feedback given by teachers. For example, eleventh grade students spoke about how the feedback given by teachers 
has improved their work in pre-calculus and English class. Students also indicated that sometimes they work with a 
partner to help them with their work. Students and teachers shared that the school uses a uniform collaboration 
rubric for students to do peer editing and give each other feedback.  

The school has developed curriculum maps for all content areas in all grades and has made strategic decisions in their 
revision and adjustment process to emphasize coherence and higher order skills across grades and subject areas. The 
leadership shared curriculum maps for grades nine through eleven demonstrating the adaptations and revision 
process for alignment and coherence for writing and English literature. Teachers collaborate on a weekly basis to 
analyze students’ data and make informed decisions on revisions of curriculum maps. Teachers and the leadership 
ensure that driving questions are written across the grades in all subjects and lesson plan templates are uniform and 
used by all when planning. After an analysis of the writing data, teachers decided to begin the writing units with 
graphic organizers across the grades and to align and adjust the rubrics to be more specific to the writing tasks.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement.

Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Union Square Academy for Health Sciences Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment 
of the needs of all parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with 
disabilities. Our school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent 
involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation 
through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of 
parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

In developing the Union Square Academy for Health Sciences Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I 
participating students, parent members of the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as 
parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy 
and asked to survey their members for additional input.  

 

To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, Union Square Academy for Health Sciences will:

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We use the Scholastic Reading Inventory (S. R. I.) to assess student's lexile score to align resources, materials and reading to 
students via daily dashboard.  This dashboard is aligned to daily instructional activities were data is used to differentiate 
instruction from formative data in three structures: independent reading, computer adaptive and small group instruction tied 
to specific skills that students need to learn to fill in instructional gaps. Teacher reviews data each night to create their lesson 
plan and assign groups for following day. Student goals are set tied to our learning intentions for that day's three stations. 
Assignments on computer adaptive screen are aligned to individual student profiles with visuals, questions, audio support and 
teacher feedback. Small group instruction is tailored around phonetical awareness, sight words or sentence construction for 
emerging English language learners.  This is done with System 44 and teacher support. Transitioning and expanding English 
language learners receive support via R-books in small group instruction by teacher, tied to just right books based on interest 
and Lexile score, and reading comprehension activities tied to formative individual student data on dashboard. Teacher also

assigns project artifacts, like essays, book reports and oral presentations for different units of study to tie language acquisition 
skills to academic learning in other subjects.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
n/a We are still a new school.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We provide Scolastic Read 180 and System 44 to those English language learners that need each program's support for sight 
words, vocabulary, modeling, scaffolding, fluency, and reading comprehension tied to writing genres. We target students for 
small group instruction based on data from dashboard on particular skills and lessons. We meet with students for reading and 
writing conferences to provide one to one tutoring, and instructional support tailored to individual student needs based on 
student work.     
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We noticed we had many newcomers have moved into emerging and transitioning or even expanding levels with this ninety-
minute support literacy block in addition to regular English language arts class.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

All English Language Learner students are block programmed to ensure continual delivery of required instruction at end of day 
for two periods. We use materials from Scholastic and Read180/System 44 and Achieve3000. We have a licensed T.E.S.O.L. 
teacher that teaches all English Language Learners' at least the three periods a day. We use home language survey to ascertain 
home language. Students received an additional English class with a licensed English teacher in addition to their block. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Newly admitted English Language Learners take LAB-R to ascertain their language proficiency in addition to school 
based diagnostics like teacher created writing prompts and Scholastic's Reading Inventory. Former English Language 
Learners are programmed for grade appropriate content area classes with additional supports. Guidance counselor 
monitors student progress and meets with parents to ascertain student needs and programming. We give N.Y. S. E.S. 
L.A.T. each May to all English Language Learners to ascertain their progress and program them appropriately using the 
test and our own diagnostic assessments as well.   Ninth graders are programmed for Algebra, Global Studies Year 1, 
and The Living Environment; in the least restrictive environment. We have an ENL teacher and a co-teacher for three 
periods a day per child in the Algebra and two English classes. The ESL teacher is there to differientiate instruction by

learning profile, tiered assignments with scaffolded assistance as well as teach. The English teacher who is a dual 
certified Special Education is there to deliver content.  . By grouping the English Language Learner's and creating extra 
English literature classes, Union Square Academy is adhering to the mandated minutes required as stated on Page 2 of 
Language Allocation Policy. Therefore, as they are programmed into classes based on data as follows:  Beginner E. L. L. 
s (135 minutes/day), Intermediate E. L. L.s (100 minutes/day) or Advanced E. L. L. s (fifty minutes a day). Beginner and 
intermediate E. L. L.s  receive extra classes in English to enhance their verbal and reading skills coupled with grammar, 
vocabulary, independent reading, small group instruction, and whole class instruction in block. They are exposed to 
informational texts, magazine articles, literature, and many genres. Audio books are also used. All students receive 
the 9th grade ELA course in addition to this block to maintain their integration with mainstream as well. All U. S. A. 
teachers are working with the T.E.OS.L. teacher to provide additional and appropriate reading material for the 
students, based on skill and language proficiency in all subjects. Teachers coordinate this during common planning 
time.  Currently, all non-special education E.L.L.'s are grouped together to accommodate a program in which an 
T.E.O.S.L. teacher will teach them math and push-in to their ELA class. In addition, all E.L.L.'s are taking a double 
literature class to increase their reading and writing skills. Students with interrupted formal education (S. I. F. E.) are 
given Achieve 3000 in their native language and are programmed for Read180/System 44 support in reading, writing, 
listening, speaking and sight word development for ninety-minutes each day except Wednesdays (forty-five minutes). 
Native language arts support in Spanish is given once a week after-school. S. I. F. E. libraries and materials are part of 
the Read 180 program from Scholastic.

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Newly admitted English Language Learners take LAB-R to ascertain their language proficiency in additon to school based 
diagnostics like teacher created writing prompts, and Scholastic's Reading Inventory. Former English Language Learners are 
programmed for grade appropriate content area classes with additonal supports. Guidance counselor monitors student 
progress and meets with parents to ascertain student needs and programming. We give N.Y. S. E.S. L.A.T. each May to all 
English Language Learners to ascertain their progress and program them appropriately using the test and our own diagnostic 
assessments as well.  Ninth graders are programmed for Algebra, Global Studies Year 1, and The Living Environment; in the

to increase their reading and writing skills. Students with interrupted formal eduation (S. I. F. E.) are given Achieve 3000 in 
their native language and are programmed for Read 180/System 44 support in reading, writing, listening, speaking and sight 
word development for ninety-minutes each day except Wednesdays (forty-five minutes). Native language arts support in 
Spanish is given once a week after-school. S. I. F. E. libraries and materials are part of the Read 180 program from Scholastic.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
    All English language learners in the country less than six years gets one English period with additional periods of English that 
infuses reading, writing, speaking and listening in a ninety-minute block with phonetical activities, read aloud, audio books, 
sight words, fluency instruction, small group and individual differentiated supports as entry points. Long-term English 
Language Learners also get this support and tutoring by T. E. S. O. L. and content teachers. We use the Scholastic's Common 
Core Code X curricula for expanding students to raise rigor, provide direct informational text support, academic reading 
comprehension strategies and build vocabulary while connecting to other subjects.  
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

    The guidance counselor reviews the NYSESLAT information for list noticed students entering Union Square Academy for 
Health Sciences from their intermediate/junior high schools.  Students and their parents are interviewed at entry and 
administered the Home Language Identification Survey (H. L. I. S). They are placed in mandated ESL classes based on the 
indicated level from N. Y. S. E. S. L. A.T. and other classroom data like teacher diagnostics.  Over the counter students and their 
parents referred to U.S.A.  by the Office of High School Placement are interviewed (oral interview) by guidance counselors.  We 
administer LAB-R within 20 days of student arriving new to the country. The Home Language Survey is completed by all 
families with a staff member that is able to assist. Union Square has Spanish and Mandarin speaking faculty in case we need 
translation services.  Completed surveys are forwarded to the Assistant Principal who oversees E. L. L.  instruction.  Our 
Spanish teacher provides a period a week for native language arts support via tutoring. All students identified through ATS 
(RLAT) will receive the N. Y. S. E. S. L. A. T.  annually. Administration of the exam will be conducted by the Assistant Principal, 
the test coordinator in May each year. After the data is analyzed parents are called are called in to discuss the option and 
explained the 3 programs: Transitional, Dual Language and Freestanding E. S. L.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

ELLs are programmed for grade appropriate content area classes.  Ninth graders are programmed for Algebra, Global Studies 
Year 1, and The Living Environment.  Tenth graders are programmed for Geometry, Global Studies Year 2 and Earth Science or 
Chemistry.  Eleventh graders receive Trigonometry, US History and Government and a Science elective.  Twelfth graders are 
given Economics, Participation in Government, and a C. T. E dental or pharmacy elective.  All students receive Physical 
Education instruction for eight terms and a term of Health Education and are required to complete an a Music class as part of 
their graduation requirements.  English instruction is based on LAB-R and NYSESLAT scores.  ELLs receive instruction in English 
based on their level of English proficiency.  For English instruction, they are grouped by level for ESL instruction regardless of 
grade.  Emerging, Transitional and expanding ESL learners also receive ELA instruction according to their grades.  Students who 
are part of a co-teaching model and travel together as a group; however, all students benefit from the various organizational 
models in dental, pharmacy, instructional core, and piano. 
  
2. Staffing is based on student needs.  Tallies for all subject areas determine the number of teachers who will serve the 
group.  ESL teachers are assigned to groups of students based on students’ levels.  Teachers are currently assigned to teach 
ESL, with co-teaching push-in model classes. The school also utilizes a number of software programs, such as PowerSpeak, 
System 44, and Read 180 to incorporate technology and improve student outcomes. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

  
3.  Content area instruction is delivered in English.  Pairing and grouping of students facilitate their comprehension of content 
in classes. Bilingual dictionaries and visual aids are used in content area classrooms.  Some teachers also speak the native 
language fluently. 
  
4.  SIFEs (Students with Interrupted Formal Education) receive Basic ESL instruction and are scheduled for the reading 
workshop model of instruction class which assists them with decoding and encoding and reading comprehension with infused 
sight words.  In addition, books with visuals, System 44 and Read 180 materials are geared to adaptive assignments tied to 
their learning needs with a heavy emphasis on vocabulary, pronunciation, fluency and phonetical awareness. 
  
•     ELLs in US schools less than three years’ proficiency levels were evaluated with the Scholastic Reading Inventory (S. R. 
I.)  The System 44 program is added to the instruction of Basic newcomer  ESL students.  This accelerates and adapts to 
individual students' language skills.  Read 180 and Code X programs have been added to support ESL instruction for emerging, 
transitioning and expanding ESL learners to build reading comprehension and thinking skills.  It also builds vocabulary by 
differentiating based on how students answer the questions.  Computer rooms and times have been specifically set to 
facilitate the implementation of these programs. 
  
•           ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years are given additional support in the form of tutoring and credit-bearing after school 
classes in ESL, Regents Prep and Native Language Arts instruction.                                                                                                      
  
•     Long- Term ELLs who have completed 6 years are given additional support in the form of tutoring and credit bearing after 
school classes in content areas and Spanish instruction.   
  
•     ELLs identified as having special needs are programmed in CTT classes.  When warranted (as per IEPs) individual 
educational para-professionals are assigned to support the instruction of these students. 
  
•     The schoolwide and individual Data Inquiry Teams study and evaluate the transcripts of at-risk students including 
ELLs.  ELLs are part of the final target groups selected for Inquiry Teams to work with.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 We provide tiered assignments online to support the students with teacher feedback loop which models and supports 
language learners  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
After school classes and tutoring in ESL, ELA, Math, Regents Prep, Science and Social Studies are offered to support the 
transition of ELLs.  Bilingual dictionaries and visuals are used in content area classes to support content comprehension and 
mastery.  A native language arts class taught in Spanish, helps build student literacy skills eventually leading to transfer of 
skills.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Bernardo Ascona, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

As per Chancellor's Regulations all incoming students are given H. L. I. S. to determine their home language 
followed by NYSITELL to determine English Language Learners status. We then determined that Spanish, and 
Mandarin are languages that need translation and interpretation services. All correspondence is sent to homes in 
foreign language or translated via School Messenger system. School messenger translates into the two languages 
our students speak at home: Spanish and Mandarin.  

Written information is effectively translated for parents into the languages identified above when needed. The 
Assistant Principals work with school business manager, Spanish teacher, and translation unit to translate 
documents to Spanish. Time constraints have been noted during oral translations. The majority of parents need

translation services in Spanish and Mandarin. These were reported via the monthly at the Parents' Association 
meetings.  

 

 

 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language
