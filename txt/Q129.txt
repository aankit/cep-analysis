Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our school mission statement for P.S. 129 is as follows: 

“Children can…” 

“Through a commitment to educational excellence, in a secure and supportive environment, the P.S 129 community 
will inspire students to become lifelong learners and to develop a strong sense of self-worth and respect. We facilitate 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

scientific discovery, artistic creativity, and the use of technology. We respect different learning styles and encourage 
students to become independent thinkers and responsible citizens in a diverse world.” 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S. 129 is located in College Point, Queens. College Point is a historical neighborhood with many one and two family 
homes. Traditionally, College Point has been a stable community with many long- time residents. Within the last ten 
years there has been a major increase in population in the community. Several multiple family dwellings have been 
constructed in place of some one family homes. We are proud of our diverse school community with diverse 
backgrounds. We have approximately 1080 students in grades K – 5. In addition to our general education population, 
we have 11 (ICT) Integrated Co- teaching classes and 5 Self Contained Special Education classes of which we are very 
proud. Our ESL (English as a Second Language) teachers provide an English as a New Language(ENL) program to assist 
children for whom English is a newl anguage. We have approximately 300 students in our current ENL program. 

Students are exposed to technology at a young age. Each classroom has one-two IMACs available and a minimum of 
10 IPADS. In addition, students are able to access laptops and additional IPADS in their classrooms for research and 
student work. Each classroom is outfitted with a SMARTBOARD (two in each ICT(Integrated Co-Teaching) classroom) 
and each teacher with a Lenovo laptop. Our library will also contain at least 25 IMACS. This increased technology 
helps to prepare students for the technological changes to the world around them. 

 

Partnerships 

Currently, all grades are using Go Math, Algebra for All (Grade 5),Ready Gen, Fundations provided by NYCDOE (New 
York City Department of Education). Teachers adapt these programs to meet the needs of their students. Our arts 
program consists of full-time visual arts, dance, and drama teachers. Dance, Visual Arts and Drama incorporate music 
into their programs, allowing students to access all four arts disciplines. We have partnerships with NYC Mental 
Health Association,The New York Debate League, CASA(Cultural After School ARTS Programs); Project Boost; Activity 
Works, Move to Improve and Dancing Classrooms.  

 

Initiatives 

 

P.S. 129 has been selected as a P.R.O.S.E. ( Progressive Redesign Opportunity Schools) school for the next five 
years. Extra Professional Days will be added to the calendar, as well as flexible parent engagement time. 

PS 129 celebrates its promising practices. Our programs foster a sense of respect and pride in our students. Students 
learn how to treat each other as equals, learn the basics of chivalry, and take great pride in their performances 
throughout the year. Continued and new initiatives will take place this year. They include: 

  Our positive behavior program which was highlighted on the DOE(Department of Education) website. 

Students in grades 4 and 5 will continue as mentors for our younger students to help solve problems and 
become big brothers and sisters. In the 2015-2016, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 school years, we have been 
designated as a 'Respect for All' winning school. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

  We have been selected to be part of PE works, giving us four Physical Education teachers on staff. We will 

engage in Field Day Activities next year, engaging community members, parents and students, in 
collaboration with our Health and Physical Education program... 

  We celebrate students’ good work through writing celebrations, our annual awards night and student arts 
performances. In addition, this year, all of our teachers including cluster teachers, science, health, dance, 
visual arts, computer and drama held celebrations for parents of classes in their schedules. This year we plan 
to recognize 'Citizenship' at award ceremonies every two months and Attendance awards every two months, 
as well. 

  We began a program for parents who speak another language and who want to learn English, weekly. This 

year many more parents attended and hope to even expand more next year.  

  Teacher teams will be slightly revamped. With the PROSE option teachers will work in teams to plan together, 

study student work and data and visit each others classrooms to improve both writing and mathematics.  

New and Continued Initiatives this year are: 

  Algebra for All will be added to our fifth grade departmentalized classrooms. 
  Our ‘Wildcats’ basketball team and cheerleaders will again take place next year, giving students a sense of 

 

teamwork and responsibility. 
Four years ago, we instituted the ‘Star-Bucks’ behavioral program as a school wide initiative. Students earn 
both individual and class ‘Star-Bucks’, which are redeemed for a wide range of rewards. The initiative was 
embraced by the entire school community with class rewards that included a tour with the custodian 
engineer, popcorn and movie parties, lunch with the Principal and Assistant Principals, etc. These rewards 
help to promote community awareness, interpersonal skills, and acts of kindness. It will continue next year 
with a few adjustments. Assistant Principal for an hour, Magic and Science with the Principal, Crafts with the 
Assistant Principal, and tours of the basement with the Custodian Engineer were highlights. 

  Our "Wildcats" incentive program rewarding best behaved classes will continue. 
  The departmentalization of our grade 5 classes continues. We will be departmentalizing in ELA, social studies, 

math and science. Algebra for All will be a new initiative for our fifth grade this near. 

  Career day will continue to be held in June in conjunction with college and career readiness. Volunteers from 

city agencies, our parent population and community members come in to share a little about their careers 
and children get a better understanding of how the skills they learn in school can and will apply to real life 
situations. 

  We will continue with the American Debate League this year and Dancing Classrooms. Our students were the 

top winners in Elementary School for Top Speakers and Top Teams. 

  We have an active Parent Teacher Association. One of the highlights is our after school parent-child arts and 

crafts workshop. In addition, our teachers have worked together on classroom celebrations and workshops to 
help bring parents into the building and share ways to help their children, bridging the home-school 
connection.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Special Student Populations and Specific Needs 

 

We have approximately 300 English Language Learners and 240 Students with Special Needs, in addition to 71% of 
our students in a low economic bracket and 76 Students in Temporary Housing.

Our subgroups are in need of at-risk counseling services, funds for activities within the school and trips, Response to 
Intervention services and classroom scaffolding of work. Through professional development through a partnership 
with the Mental Health Clinic, we will increase our already high level social-emotional programs.  

 

Through GoldMansour-Rutherford scaffolding techniques, teachers will continue to refine their practice. Our teachers 
work collaboratively in professional learning communities to analyze student data and direct student learning 
objectives. They also create and share rubrics that are given to students prior to beginning projects and activities, so 
that students are constantly aware of expectations set for them. 

 

We will maintain two guidance counselors and two speech teachers, one bilingual, to help meet the needs of these 
students. We have an f-status teacher to assist with Response to Intervention Services, and an 5 teachers for ESL 
children. We have three staff developers who will also assist with Professional Development and an IEP teacher 
providing Response to Intervention (RTI) services.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Elements of the Framework that We Made Most Progress Over the Past Year 

  Rigorous Instruction 
  Collaborative Teachers 
 
 
  Effective School Leadership 

Strong Family Ties 
Supportive Environment 

Rigorous instruction in math was and still is a major focus. We incorporated Productive Struggle at the beginning of 
math lessons this year to increase student understanding of problem solving. We have seen a growth this year. This 
will continue in 2018 with an inquiry based lab model in math. 

We also made strides in the area of Collaborative Teachers. Our productive struggle group was complimented by the 
superintendent and invited to present at a Principal's Conference this year. 

We began Sanford Harmony practices this year in our Health Education classes and also our regular classrooms. 
Social-emotional well being is stressed through varied activities. 

Key Areas of Focus for this School Year 

In the areas of rigorous instruction teachers will continue to engage in data analysis through the use of formative 
assessments within lessons. This data will be used to inform planning and pacing of lessons, and provide multiple 
entry points to meet the needs of all students. We will also continue to focus on productive struggle in mathematics 
by beginning lessons with a group problem of the day. The strategies will be discussed and students will decide what 
needs to be improved and what was done well. Algebra for All in Grade 5 will be instituted this year. 

In the area of effective school leadership, we have maintained positions for three staff developers to mentor teachers 
and provide demonstration lessons throughout the school.  

As a P.R.O.S.E. school teachers will meet collaboratively to work on improving lessons and plan intervisitations to 
improve instruction and student growth.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

Strengths 

 

● 1. As a result of our latest Quality Review on March 31, 2016, we received a score of Well Developed in 1.1 and the 
suggestion was to further the refinement of curricula to contain more specificity in Unit Maps in alignment with the 
Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS).  

 

We have a collaborative staff, who work together as both grade teacher teams and cross-grade teacher teams. For 
the past two years, teachers have worked on filling in any gaps in the Ready Gen reading and writing programs and 
the Go Math program. Productive Struggle in math will continue to be revised. 

 

The NYC School survey 2017 shows our rating in Rigorous Instruction is 4.84 in total. 98% of the staff agrees that the 
shifts in ELA are rigorous at 4.64. 97% of the staff agrees that the shifts in Math are rigorous at 4.45. 

 

Areas of Focus 

 

2. PPO in 2018 preliminary data encourages us to give additional attention to ensure that there is consistency of 
feedback across all administrators on your team. "Please consider the following recommendation: Revisit your 
systems and structures for evaluating observations. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15 

 

PPO areas of improvement also indicated that we engage in analysis of feedback practices across our school 
community, provide professional learning to staff and routinely follow-up so that the quality of feedback remains 
consistent across classrooms. 

 

As we receive results from state tests, we will analyze item analysis in literacy and mathematics. 

Teachers have noted that students have improved in their struggle with problem solving proficiency based on 

June results. Preliminary data shows that 97% of Grade 3 students, 96% of Grade 4 students and 97% of 

grade 5 students met preliminary cuts in mathematics. However, this will still be a focus this year 

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

 

By June 2019, we will align professional learning to deepen student’s conceptual understanding and problem solving 
skills resulting in a 5% increase in the number of students in grade 5 achieving proficiency on the school created 
Productive Struggle assessment in May.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

Strengths 

The Framework for Great Schools Report 2017-18 shows that we received a Well Developed in this area . Our Quality 
Review, March 31, 2016 score was well-developed in this area, as well. 

 

The School Quality Guide 2017-2018 had a high of 4.43 in Social Emotional. 

We will continue maintaining two guidance counselors and three staff developers. 

 

School Survey: 98% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the adults teach students the skills they need to regulate 
their behavior. 

95% of parents agreed that their school make them aware if their are any social or emotional issues affecting their 
children's academics. 

 

 

Need 

Based on a needs assessment, professional development is needed in social-emotional development. Parenting 
workshops are needed to help parents meet the social and emotional needs of their children.  

 

In the 2017-2018 PPO it was stated, "As you plan for next year, it is recommended that you consider organizing a 
school based team to evaluate the diverse needs of your parent community and design a tiered parent engagement 
plan to reach and support your most struggling parents." This was accomplished. We plan to do more outreach to 
parents to attend Family Fridays to observe teaching and learning.

School Survey 2015-2016 showed an increase from 85% to 94%. 

PTA meetings will continue to be rotated in the morning, afternoons and night to make it convenient for parents to 
attend. 

One of our strengths is that parents come to our school in large numbers for Parent/Teacher Conferences and School 
Performances.  

We have noted a marked increase in parent engagement when having celebrations, performances, contests, 
classroom activities and celebration weeks. We will add "Good Citizen" recognition this year. 

 

Need 

We have instituted English classes weekly for our ESL parents and hope to outreach more to increase the numbers 
attending.  

Increased engagement by students in book clubs.

administration to include their ideas and thoughts in adapting curriculum. Mastery Connect will be used to maintain 
data. Training is done by Staff Developers on MOSL administration and grading. Mastery Connect training is done for 
teachers in need by the Assistant Principal and teacher leads. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 129 in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 129 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
Begin description here:  We have analyzed the NYSITELL scores for children in our ELL 
program.  When analyzing preliminary data from NYSESLAT and classroom assessments we 
have found that ENL students have made gains in speaking but their listening, reading and 
writing skills are lower in proficiency scores.  We have also noticed that ENL students perform 
well within grade bands of the NYSESLAT (1-2, 3-4) but when shifting to a new grade band 
their progress is minimal within the proficiency levels. Our current grades 3, 4 and 5 ELLs who 
have been in enrolled in ENL programs for 3 or more years have not made significant progress in 
testing out of ENL. We have found greater success with new ENL students making greater 
progress based on our projections for the 2018 NYSESLAT results. We hope with the 
continuation of our after school and Saturday programs we will continue to see progress for all 
ENL students and better address the needs of the long term ELLs.As a result of this analysis, we 
found that children do not score proficiency in Listening and Speaking. These lower scores 
prevent the students from moving to Commanding in the ELL program. In order to meet the 
needs of all of our diverse families and students we will offer two programs, one after-school 
program for 3 hours per week. We will focus on beginners and students who made little gain in 
NYSESLAT scores. We will also offer a Saturday Program for 2 hours, due to the needs of the 
working parents.  Many of the ELL’s are picked up by private schools for after school 
babysitting and homework help for most of the working ELL parents.  The children remain in 
these programs until 6-7 PM, a service we cannot provide.  Therefore Saturday services are 
necessary to assist our children.  
We will offer the Saturday program to ELL students in grades 3, 4 and 5, who scored Entering 
through Commanding on the NYSESLAT test in May 2018, as well as newcomers to our school 
this year.  This is approximately 120 students.  We anticipate 80 students will accept.  The 
program will be 2 hours long each Saturday from 9AM -11-AM for 13 Saturdays (January 7- 
April 6).  The after-school program will begin on October 17 and continue through May 16.  We 
anticipate approximately 40 students to accept the after-school program. 
The Saturday program will include 4 ENL teachers and 2 content specialists for 13 sessions 
(2hours per session).   This is a total of 6 teachers.  The after-school program will include ENL 
teachers and 2 content specialists. 
The program will begin on January 7 and end on April 6. 
Activities include 
1.     How does a photograph tell a story 
2.     Knowing and using  materials and resources 
3.     Understanding different points of view 
4 .     Examining photos from newspapers and magazines , as well as famous photographers 
5.      Understanding that photography is a powerful means of communication. 
 
The after-school program will provide teaching specialists from Marquis Studios to work 
alongside our own teachers in a residency called “Project Respect”.

using critical thinking and verbal skills.    Students will respond in both written and oral language 
their understanding and interpretation of the photographs and conversations..  Students will 
recognize the features and understand the function of structure within a diverse society.   Self- 
confidence, critical thinking and free expression is enhanced through these program. 
When critical thinking is integrated within the daily curriculum, engaging and numerous learning 
experiences transpire for early childhood learners (Chauhan, 2004; Royka, 2002). Besides being 
"fun" for most children, kinesthetic activities can help young learners, especially English 
language learners, develop decoding skills, fluency, vocabulary, syntactic knowledge, discourse 
knowledge, and metacognitive thinking (Sun, 2003). Teaching language skills through 
constructing and movement gives children a context for listening and meaningful language 
production, provides opportunities for reading and writing development (Chauhan, 2004), and 
involves children in reading and writing as a holistic and meaningful communication process 
(McNamee, McLane, Cooper, & Kerwin, 1985). In addition to the development of gross and fine 
motor coordination skills, creative expression and thinking, social interaction, problem solving 
can be enhanced.  The ENL Standard #5 talks about cross cultural identification, which will be 
met through our Social –Emotional program.  
In addition to the residencies, time will be devoted to language acquisition, listening and 
speaking, solely by the ENL teacher in conjunction with content specialists.  ENL teachers are 
certified in English as a New Language.  Content specialists are licensed in Common Branches. 
Teachers will parallel teach, team teach and scaffold instruction to meet the needs of all students. 
We will support home language by hiring bilingual paraprofessionals to help in native 
language.

Professional Development will take place in conjunction with our partners using ELL approaches 
to coherent instruction in reading, writing, listening and speaking in the content areas. By 
integrating authentic learning in photography, students will engage in motivating lessons, write 
about their photos and speak about their photos.  Their self-esteem will show gains by displaying 
the photos throughout the building. ENL teachers and general education teachers  will share in 
use of in ELL strategies. With a focus on Common Core and Next Generation Standards, 
research-based strategies supporting ENL comprehension and participation will be explored 
throughout the year with our ENL Instructional Lead. The Instructional lead will attend a 
minimum of 4 days professional development from the BFC throughout the year and will 
turnkey this information to teachers in the program.  We will devote Monday afternoon 
professional development (80 minutes each Monday of the school year) to  research-based 
studies on content area learning and authentic learning for ENL teachers.  In addition, we will

devote 1/2 hour of professional learning and sharing on each Saturday (14) of the Saturday 
program.  Teachers will be present during the teaching artist sessions and co teach with them in 
hopes that they can use this hands-on PD with the ENL students not able to attend the program. 
Reciprocal meetings with the teaching specialists and ENL teachers will place prior during the 
10 weeks that Marquis Studios works with the students.  The ENL teachers will share research 
and information from ENL workshops to best assist the children. By teaching English through 
content areas, children will be motivated to learn creating greater improvement in their 
progress.    Attendance sheets and agendas will be kept in the main office.  The program will be 
supervised by an Assistant Principal.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Teacher-created assessments, checklists, observations, and conference notes are used on a daily basis to drive instruction. 
Teacher-created assessments in the home language are also used. Early literacy skills are assessed with the Fountas and 
Pinnell evaluation system for independent reading levels. The data from this assessment tool helps provide information 
relevant to how the school's instructional plan may be adapted for appropriate differentiation. The data indicates that ELLs are 
slower to progress in their reading levels (due to the demands of language acquisition), and are then used to plan small group 
instruction for reading. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

ENL teachers meet twice a month to discuss instructional planning for academic, social and emotional success. ENL and 
classroom teachers meet once a month to discuss reading levels and grouping. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of our ENL program by using NYSESLAT scores to track the increase in the percentage of ELLs that 
moved up one or more levels, as compared to the previous year. Additionally, we use the ELL Periodic Assessment to 
determine progress mid-year. The NYC Performance Tasks and curriculum-based assessments are also used. Curriculum goals 
and objectives are adapted for student achievement in alignment with the NYS Learning Standards to improve the success of 
our program.  Areas of Need are in writing and reading. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the data has been gathered and analyzed in September, the ENL teachers use the EDAT and meet as a team to plan how 
to address needs in listening and speaking while further assessing reading and writing needs to close the students’ 
achievement gap. ENL teachers then meet on grade once a month to reflect and discuss results of the assessments and best 
practices to close the achievement gap. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
RTI providers collaborate with classroom and ENL teachers. Progress monitoring data is used to assess student progress in 
order to differentiate research-based targeted instruction focused on promoting language and literacy development. In order 
to increase their motivation and literacy success, tasks are related to students’ lives. When necessary, a special education 
referral is also considered.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The 2016 NYSESLAT data reveal that the majority of students across all grade levels scored at the Expanding or Commanding 
levels.  The overall number of ELLs is largest in grade 2, however there has been a slight increase in Entering and Emerging 
levels in grades 3 and 4 due to NYSITELL results of newly enrolled students.  Students are grouped according to ability 
(Entering and Emerging) (Transitioning, Expanding, Commanding).  Data provides areas of focus.  ELL teachers work in 
consistent grades and push into classes to work in the content areas and provide ENL lessons.  Struggling students will be 
offered an after school program two days per week. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

ENL teachers refer to EDAT on a weekly basis and participate in inquiry meetings to focus on instructional planning that 
addresses students’ needs based on the language modalities and sub-groups of ELLs. Teachers reflect on their practice by 
viewing and discussing student work and assessment results, to decide what interventions need to be put into place and/or 
what adjustments should be made. Mastery Connect also allows administrators and teachers to analyze school-wide data to 
determine which learning standards students need additional support to master, and provides a list of possible 
interventions.  The structures are assessments in reading, writing and math monthly  and weekly as appropriate.  Formative 
assessment takes place daily to monitor student growth and understanding. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

 ENL teachers push into classrooms using approaches of parallel, station, and alternative teaching.  All classes are 
heterogeneous.  The Freestanding ENL program follows a push-in program model for teachers to deliver 
instruction.  For those students requiring 360 minutes, half the time is spent on stand-alone ENL, implemented in 
their classrooms, and the other half of the time is spent on integrated ENL, also in their classrooms.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not applicable. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Not applicable. 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

         All ELLs in our school receive the NYS mandated number of hours for acquiring English language skills by certified ENL 
teachers. Entering and Emerging students receive 360 minutes per week.  Transitioning and Expanding level students receive 
180 minutes per week.  Commanding students will continue to receive 90 minutes of instruction per week for two 
years.  Certified ENL teachers look at students' proficiency levels, check the number of minutes mandated, and push into the 
students' classrooms for the mandated time.  We have 5 push-in ESL teachers who provide both ENL and Content area 
instruction to Entering and Emerging students and Content area instruction in conjunction with the classroom teachers takes 
place during the mandated times with scaffolded teaching lessons. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  ELA, Math and other content areas are delivered in English in a co-teaching setting during the school day.  Differentiated 
instruction is delivered to all ELLs through various methods and approaches to make content comprehensible and enrich 
language development.  Objectives are clearly defined and designed to meet the demands of the NYS Learning Standards. 
Students are provided with opportunities for meaningful discussions around content and skills, vocabulary is pre-taught, and 
concepts are made clear through modeling, gestures, visuals, etc.  Scaffolding techniques and critical thinking questions are 
used throughout all lessons.  Children work actively in a student-centered environment.  Every lesson addresses all four 
language skills.  Newcomer students are taught basic social and academic language skills.  When possible, the native language 
is used to support learning.  Students are also paired with reading partners who speak their native language.  Bilingual 
dictionaries, bilingual paraprofessionals and native language materials are used.  The review and assessment of student 
comprehension and learning is ongoing.  Students are given preparatory instruction throughout the school year for both the 
NYSESLAT and the ELA.  Specific strategies are targeted based on students' previous performance on the reading and writing 
sections of the NYSESLAT.  Materials used in the freestanding ENL program are: charts, realia, pocket charts, flashcards, 
sentence frames and sentence starters, visuals, word lists, picture cards, shades of meaning cards, lucites with templates, and 
picture dictionaries. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  After being administered the NYSITELL and a Spanish speaking student is identified as an ELL, he or she is then evaluated with 
the Spanish LAB.  Bilingual ENL teachers administer formative and summative assessments to their students in the home 
language throughout the year. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

Instruction for ELLs is differentiated and aligned with NYS Learning Standards for all subgroups, and is culturally relevant to 
motivate all students to participate. 
Our instructional plan for SIFE students includes: a supportive environment for the students with a bilingual staff, ENL teachers 
using specific second language learning strategies to help SIFEs reach academic success, a buddy system with classmates, and 
parent coordinator support for both students and parents in the school.  An increased use of visuals and collaborative learning 
opportunities is implemented.  Thematic curricula and individual learning plans, as well as an adapted curriculum is used to 
cover most relevant information that is accessible and age-appropriate. Explicit instruction is given in the basic reading 
components: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and text comprehension.  Finally, students have access to a 
literacy-rich environment. In addition, students are given a tour of the school so they can locate important places, and they are 
taught the names of important people.  Specific school routines and behavior expectations are reviewed.  The child's home 
language is used when possible to support learning.   
Regarding newcomers, a similar plan is put in place. A print-rich environment is provided for students.  Word associations and 
KWL charts are used to activate prior knowledge.  Students are engaged in hands-on learning through role-play, drama, TPR 
and SMARTboard activities.  New vocabulary is pre-taught and analyzed in context.  Explicit instruction in the basic reading 
components is given, and students work in collaborative discussion groups to develop and practice social skills.  In addition, 
students are given a tour of the school so they can locate important places, and they are taught the names of important 
people.  Specific school routines and behavior expectations are reviewed.  The child's home language is used when possible to 
support learning.   
For ELLs receiving services between 4-6 years, small group instruction is provided to target their specific needs.  Previous 
testing data is used to determine their academic needs, and to teach them strategies and skills to improve their academic 
performance.  Picture cards and picture dictionaries provide additional support.  Students are guided in editing and publishing 
final pieces in writing and research.  They use computer and Internet programs that are designed to increase vocabulary and 
improve grammar, such as Imagine Learning and Starfall. 
Regarding long-term ELLs, a focus on literacy development across content areas is key.  Explicit vocabulary instruction, 
sentence analysis and scaffolding activities are used. Teachers collaborate on lesson planning tailored to students' needs.  
Former ELL students receive 2 periods of ENL instruction per week for two years after reaching proficiency on the NYSESLAT.  If 
students are not successful in class, transitional support is offered based on individual needs.  This support may be limited to 
specific content areas as needed. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
When ELLs are identified as having special needs, the ENL teacher reviews their IEPs and confers with special education 
teachers and other service providers. They receive small group instruction provided by means of parallel and 
alternative  teaching models.  In some classes, students are assisted by bilingual paraprofessionals.  Students are supported 
with anticipatory strategies such as front-loading vocabulary and previewing texts to access background knowledge.  Other 
scaffolding strategies included differentiated graphic organizers, sentence frames, and guide cards to help students focus.  In 
addition, picture dictionaries and books in the native language are available for them. Collaborative student discussions are 
facilitated with the use of conversational prompts to improve comprehension, as well as speaking and listening 
skills.  Materials are content-specific in that materials such as manipulatives and picture cards for math are mathematical, 
whereas vocabulary, sentence frames, and pictures for science will be science-based.  Further, scaffolds for literacy will be ELA 
based, such as scaffolds with temporal words to move a story forward.  Our ENL students use the Imagine Learning program, 
as well as Kidspiration, Razkids, Smartboard, and the ELMO.  The certified ENL teachers who work with ELLs have been trained 
to use supports that correspond to age and grade levels.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In order to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least restrictive environment, ENL teachers utilize the push-in 
model to collaborate curricular and instructional strategies aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards.  Classroom and 
special education teachers, out of classroom service providers,  and ENL teachers are flexible in scheduling to focus on specific 
needs of ELL-SWDs, in order to achieve their IEP goals.

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Small groups work on explicit and intensive phonics instruction with programs such as Fundations, to help build decoding skills. 
Frequent and systematic vocabulary instruction through language analysis is provided. Strategies for reading comprehension 
are taught, such as predicting, asking and answering questions, and summarizing, for analyzing and comprehending texts of 
different genres.  Oral reading, discussions and questioning, and increased exposure to print are strategies used to increase 
reading fluency. Structured opportunities for discussions are provided, as is time for independent reading. All interventions are 
offered in English for all subgroups and the native language is used whenever possible to make content more 
comprehensible.  All beginner ELLs have access to Imagine Learning accounts.  The native language is used in intervention if 
the teacher actually speaks the language.  There are no bilingual programs here, so all instruction is in English, however, 
bilingual dictionaries or computer dictionaries may be used.  Programs include Go Math interventions and scaffolded lessons, 
Fundations Decoding and Phonemic awareness program and Levelled Literacy Intervention by Fountas and Pinnell for guided 
reading. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

The push-in ENL teaching model is used to provide continuity in the classroom. Both teachers work together in a team-
teaching model to provide differentiated instruction and multiple entry points for all students.  Based on our data and 
observations, entering and emerging learners benefit from good English-speaking role models. Students at the commanding 
level have provided extensive support to both newcomers and transitioning and expanding learners.  For the upcoming year, 
class composition has changed somewhat so that those classes with ENL students are more heterogenous; whereas, students 
who require 360 minutes of service are placed in a class with former ELLs and non-ELLs, and those who require 180 minutes 
are placed in another class with former ELLs and non-ELLs. This will help students’ acquisition of the language due to increased 
opportunities for interaction with native English-speaking peers. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

There has been no bilingual program in our school. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
We plan to offer an after-school supplemental program for ELLs in the upcoming school year, and a Saturday program is open 
to ELLs.  ELLs can participate in extra-curricular activities such as basketball, cheerleading, and ballroom dancing.  Our dance 
teacher teaches content areas through dance and movement.  Students learn vocabulary, cultural differences and similarities. 
All notices regarding curricular and extra-curricular programs are provided in English and the home language.  All children are 
represented equally and can fully participate in any and all activities in our school community. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning ELLs have received access to Imagine Learning accounts, which provide them with 
vocabulary and language development activities at their individual level, with native language support as needed.  Picture 
dictionaries and picture cards are used to support ELLs in the classroom.  Internet access is available for educational websites 
(such as Raz Kids, Starfall, and BrainPop Jr.), designed to increase vocabulary and improve grammar.  Interactive SMARTboard 
activities are used to support English proficiency. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is delivered to the students through bilingual paraprofessionals, bilingual picture 
dictionaries,  Internet translation services, and books in the native language.  Any teacher working with ELLs who speaks the 
native language may also deliver instruction in that language in a small group setting.  Additionally, a peer who speaks the 
same language may provide support by translating instruction and/or assignments. Bilingual ENL teachers administer 
formative and summative assessments to their students in the home language throughout the year. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

All required services support ELLs' ages and grade levels in line with the curriculum, at their English proficiency level. Resources 
are age-appropriate and accessible to all grade levels  according to the cognitive needs of the students.  Resources are 
provided in students’ native language when available, awards are given to students for effort in class, students are encouraged 
to share work with their peers, writing celebrations are given to boost students’ self-confidence as they present their work, 
and students work in small groups and pairs to encourage collaborative learning. The certified ENL teachers who work with 
ELLs have been trained to use supports that correspond to age and grade levels. A welcoming and supportive learning 
environment is provided in all classes. Students’ individual differences are valued and respected so that a trust can form with 
teachers and peers. Lessons that include home life examples from many different cultures and engaging discussions also help 
to support individual differences.  All students are placed in age appropriate classes.  Former schools are called to gain 
information when appropriate.  Required services are provided by our licensed ESL teachers 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We are not a co-location building. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Before the beginning of the school year in August, the parent coordinator provides a new student orientation for all parents 
and students. Kindergarten orientation takes place in early September with classroom teachers, ENL teachers, school 
counselors, and parent coordinator.  For Kindergarten students who are newly enrolled before the beginning of the school 
year, a packet is provided encouraging the parents to work with their children on basic skills that they will need in school. 
Separation anxiety workshops are also provided by the guidance counselor to help students adjust to their new 
environment.  Parents are encouraged to contact the parent coordinator with any questions or concerns that arise.  Students 
are helped by counselors, teachers, paraprofessionals, translators, peers and administrators to acclimate to their new 
schools. Peer buddies are assigned.  Periodic check in by counselors and staff is conducted regularly.  The ESL teachers, Parent 
Coordinators, counselors and administrators have multiple meetings with parents when needed.  Weekly workshops are 
conducted to help parents learn English. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

There are no language electives offered at PS 129. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Not applicable. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All ENL personnel attend grade and faculty conferences devoted to differentiated learning and inquiry work.  Weekly PD and 
inquiry meetings are held to view student work and analyze how learning strategies are working for students.  In addition, ENL 
personnel may be given opportunities throughout the year to attend outside professional development highlighting specific, 
research-based strategies to use with ENL students.  There is presently no ESL coordinator in our school. 
ENL teachers may attend DELLSS PD opportunities, during which they share and exchange best instructional practices with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

 

colleagues.  Additionally, ENL teachers participate in webinars related to instructional shifts of the CCLS as they pertain to 
ELLs.  PDs that teachers attend are geared toward Common Core State-aligned instruction to support ELLs. Teachers look at 
data in small groups to see if teaching strategies used are beneficial to different student groups. Teachers use Mastery 
Connect, NYSESLAT data, interim assessment data, ELA and Math NYS test data, and formative assessments to assess student 
progress. 
 
Paraprofessionals attend Professional Development Mondays with teachers and ESL staff to ensure ELL teaching strategies are 
consistent throughout.  We will have cycles of Professional Learning which includes: 
How Can We Adapt Learning Objectives for ELL Students to Increase Engagement and Student Outcomes? (K-2) (3-5) 
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Teachers at PS 129 are experienced, certified teachers who have received the mandated ENL requirement of 15% of total 
hours.  ENL Teachers give specific ENL strategy workshops on PD Days.  Teachers  receive training in best practices for co-
teaching strategies, and integrating language and content instruction for English Language Learners.  ENL teachers receive a 
minimum of 50% professional development which focuses on language acquisition in alignment with core content area 
instruction. ENL teachers work together on PD days to participate in webinars, and teachers are sent to PD opportunities led 
by the Borough Field Support Center.  An agenda maintains records of teachers meeting the required training.  Teachers 
document their weekly professional development activities on the PD Evaluation Form, which includes attendance and is then 
submitted to the Principal.  New teachers receive mentors who assist in this training.  All teachers collaborate during inquiry 
work to discuss strategies that would best assist ENL students. This is to help teachers to become familiar with best practices in 
teaching ELLs. 
As ELLs transition from Elementary to Middle School, the guidance counselor supports staff and speaks to the class as a whole, 
providing a directory and answering questions posed by the students.  The guidance counselor is always available for students 
to meet with privately if they need additional concerns addressed.  The assistant from the middle school comes in to present a 
summary of expectations and directives.  Finally, open houses at the middles school are held throughout the year, and ELLs 
and their parents are strongly encouraged to attend. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
 
Once the EDAT is reviewed, parents are brought in individually on parent engagement days to discuss the language progress of 
their child, to explain the education policy as it pertains to ELLs, and to give them suggestions for supporting their child 
at home.  Interpreters and/or translation services are provided. Parents sign documentation of the meeting. A copy of this is 
kept in the cumulative folder and another is kept in the student file in the ENL office. 
 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents have the opportunity to attend weekly ESL classes at our school.  The ESL staff produces a quarterly newsletter, 
to    inform parents of the units of study in each grade. Parents are invited to classroom performances and celebrations 
throughout the year.  For the Lunar New Year celebration, parents had the opportunity to volunteer to create crafts with the 
children, and to contribute decorations for the celebration. 
Parents have the opportunity to individually meet with ENL teachers weekly during Tuesday parent engagement time.  At 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

 

these meetings, teachers discuss goals of the program, students' individual language development progress, assessment 
results, and language development needs in content areas.  Translators are provided for these meetings when needed.  Staff 
who speak Chinese, Spanish, and Korean are available to translate.  Parents may also bring a translator with them to 
meetings.  Additionally, other parents are available to translate. 
A log of parent meetings is kept by classroom teachers, ENL teachers, and administration.  To ensure parent needs are 
accommodated, parents are invited to workshops, and have the opportunity to communicate with teachers in person, through 
phone calls, and letters.  Staff who speak Chinese, Spanish, and Korean are available to translate.  Parents may also bring a 
translator with them to meetings.  Additionally, other parents are available to translate. 
ENL teachers hold several parent workshops per year, which specifically address ELL academic issues, and provide parents with 
information about community services.  Workshop invitations and materials are provided for parents in their native 
language.  Monthly arts and crafts workshops and movie nights are offered for all parents and students.  A Parent Book Club, 
workshops in content areas, and PTA meetings are held each month for parents.  Our Parent Coordinator works with the PTA 
using Title 1 funding for Parent/Child evening shows and special assemblies.  Parents are always welcome in our 
school.  Writing celebrations, recorder concerts, and drama presentations are held in classrooms throughout the year, and 
parents are encouraged to attend.  An opportunity to meet the teacher is held for the parents at the beginning of the school 
year.  Teachers keep communication open with parents regarding their children, to give them the opportunity to express their 
concerns and address any questions.  Staff who speak Chinese, Spanish, and Korean are available to translate.  Parents may 
also bring a translator with them to meetings.  Additionally, other parents are available to translate. 
We partner with the EPIC organization which provides workshops for parents each year.  Staff who speak Chinese, Spanish, 
and Korean are available to translate.  Parents may also bring a translator with them to meetings.  Additionally, other parents 
are available to translate.  The ESL teachers hold several workshops for parents each year, such as We Read Together, 
NYSESLAT workshops, and a curriculum fair.  Additionally, parents are invited to help with picture day, bake sales, classroom 
celebrations, school store, class trip chaperone, and are invited to PTA meetings to become members of the PTA committee. 
The SLT and PTA are integral parts of our school.  At both meetings we learn of parents' needs.  We use the Parent section of 
the Environmental survey as a place to identify the needs and wishes of parents.  A Preferred Language Report is generated to 
determine parents' first language.  All important documents are translated, including those events from the school 
calendar.  School guides are available in all languages, and translation services are available for parent-teacher meetings and 
conferences.  The ESL teachers have sign-up sheets for workshops on Meet the Teacher night in September, to see how many 
parents and which parents are interested in specific workshops.  At that time, we also discuss the needs of the parents.  The 
parent coordinator reaches out to parents to invite them to various workshops and functions. 
Parents have requested arts programs, workshops, communication in native language, and methods for hearing about their 
childrens' successes.  We have addressed these needs by having translated copies of notices, increased arts programs and 
more workshops (at least three per month).  We have also provided each teacher with translated "success notes" for sending 
home, to share the accomplishments of students with their caregivers. 
 
ELL Parents are part of our Executive Board of the PTA.  This year all parents, including ESL parents, will be invited to Family 
Fridays to sit through a lesson in their child's class once a month.  As stated before, ESL parents are invited to workshops to 
help them learn English.  Many of our parents serve as translators for others.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Marilyn Alesi, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Our assessment is based on past needs. Leadership Team, Parent Coordinator, teachers, administrators, 
counselors and parents have all given their input. HLIS forms and ATS reports indicate the language needs. Federal 
lunch forms and emergency cards were an excellent indication of the needs of the school. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
