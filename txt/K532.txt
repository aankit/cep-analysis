Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

New Bridges Elementary believes in empowering each child’s best self and preparing them for success in college and 
in life. New Bridges is both an achievement-centered, academically rigorous environment driven by high expectations 
for scholars and their families, and a holistic community school, focused on the whole development of each child 
through the active engagement of our families; the integration of the arts into curriculum; and the social and 
emotional education of our scholars. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

New Bridges Elementary - PS 532 opened as a new school in 2013 in the heart of Crown Heights, Brooklyn at the 
corner of Schenectady and Eastern Parkway. In the first year of operation, New Bridges served over 200 students 
ranging from Pre-Kindergarten to 2nd grade. This year the school expanded to serve third grade as well as two 
additional Pre-K classes. The school community this year, 2018-2019, continues at it's full size, serving Pre-K - 5th 
grade students in the 2018-2019 academic year. The community that New Bridges serves is unique and culturally 
diverse. Just over 75% of our student body identifies as black, and 19% as Hispanic.  

 

To bring the mission of the school to life, New Bridges has several purposeful and supportive partnerships. This 
includes being a Teacher’s College Reading and Writing School. The school’s literacy program is not only Common 
Core aligned and academically rigorous, but also focuses on fostering a student’s love for reading and writing and 
developing independence in both subjects. This partnership also offers significant and consistent professional 
development to teachers and staff as they develop their skills. A second partnership that the school has developed is 
with Ramapo for Children, an organization that provides teachers with training, coaching and workshops offering 
tools and tactics to create environments that foster positive behavior and promote success in children. Additionally, 
the school has been selected to participate in the Showcase Schools program with a spotlight on our best practices 
around Student Empowerment.  

At three Showcase visits throughout the year, visitors from around the city will see how New Bridges Elementary has 
created a school culture that ensures all students feel safe, supported, known and cared for. These practices include 
greeting all students at the doors by name, having every student’s birthday recognized as a community during Bright 
Start each morning, and the creation and use of “Community Codes” in each classroom to establish and maintain a 
positive, emotionally intelligent environment.  

Visitors will have the opportunity to engage with teachers who implement and plan these practices as well as to learn 
how these structures were prioritized and put in place.  

As an Arts based school it is a priority to ensure that every child has access to the Arts daily. The school provides daily 
instruction in Dance, Music and Art as well as after school programming in Keyboard, Violin, Drama and Drawing. The 
school produces several major Family Engagement productions a year, including a Family Arts Night which encourages 
parents and families of students to explore their own creative talents.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Just over 89% of students at New Bridges are eligible for free or reduced lunch. There are two ICT classrooms on each 
grade to serve a high population of students with special needs.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

In the last year, the school has made great process in the “Collaborative Teachers” component of the Framework. 
Through creative scheduling, all teachers share a common prep period five days a week. This shared time allows for 
regularly collaboration and reflection. During this time, the school made a push to Additionally, the school has grown 
in the component of “Effective School Leadership.” Teachers reflected in a school wide PD on the level of supportive 
feedback delivered by the Principal, and recognized the specificity in “next steps” as a source for professional growth.  

In the upcoming year, an area of focus for the school community will be to continue to develop in the “Rigorous 
Instruction” component of the Framework. The school community made a collective decision to choose a new Math 
curriculum, and with this change will come thoughtful planning on how to incorporate high levels of discussion and

writing within the subject. The aim is to build a deeper and more foundational mathematical understanding among 
students to support them as they grow and develop more complicated skill sets. This mindset should transfer across 
all content areas. The school will work to prioritize high level of discussion and reflection through writing in an effort 
to support a deeper and richer understanding of ideas and content. We will push practices in the instruction of 
Reading so that every classroom in the school averages over one year's growth in Reading.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Rigorous instruction requires classrooms that set high expectations and deliver common core aligned lessons but also 
differentiates and scaffolds based on the learning style and need of every student. According to the Learning 
Environment Survey and Principal Performance Observations, our school has several key strengths in this element. 
96% of our teachers believe that students do reading and writing grounded in evidence from text and in general, 91% 
of the teachers responded positively to questions about Rigorous Instruction. According the our most recent Quality 
Review Report, the school received a Developing rating in both 1.1 Curriculum and 1.2 Pedagogy, stating that, “There 
is implementation of multiple entry points, consistent student engagement by all learners, including English language 
learners and students with disabilities, in appropriately challenging tasks and demonstration of higher order thinking 
skills in all student work products”. NYS ELA and curriculum based assessment results indicate necessary areas for 
growth, including especially in students' ability to comprehend and write about texts. Finally, this year in most 
classrooms the average reading growth as measured by Fountas & Pinnell reading levels was less than a year of 
growth. Each of these data points led to the development of a SMART goal that will support improvement in these 
areas across the school. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Through an increased focus on strategically analyzing data to plan small group instruction, by June 2019 every class will 
average over a year's growth in Reading as measured in reading levels from the Fountas & Pinnell running record 
assessment.

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers will participate in data-analysis meetings every six 
weeks with formal and informal assessment data. 

Teachers will work with small groups of readers "fishbowl style" 
as a labsite to grow practices associated with particular data-
identified challenges readers are having.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
The comprehensive assessment of the Supportive Environment element at New Bridges surfaced many significant 
findings. One strength, as highlighted by the School Survey, is that 98% of parents believe New Bridges has an 
environment that is safe. Additionally, the school was given a Proficient rating in Danielson 3.4 (establish a culture for 
learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students and families and provide supports to achieve those 
expectations). It is our finding that increasing numbers of classes have safe environments, as evidenced by the 
decrease of out of class removals. On the School Survey, however, only 78% of teachers reported students do their 
work when they are supposed to and only 68% students try hard to get good grades. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 

  By June 2019, all classrooms will function at a high level of independence, with over 92% of on-task students 

during unannounced monthly “independence” walkthroughs.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In the element of Collaborative Teachers, New Bridges has demonstrated several strengths. Teams collaborate 
multiple times per week, once officially with leadership and as needed with the teachers. On the School Survey, 100% 
of teachers say they talk with one another about instruction and 98% of teachers say they design instructional 
programs together. In terms of needs, there is room for growth in collective responsibility, with only 81% of teachers 
saying that teachers take responsibility for improving the school. While teachers are working collaboratively within 
grade teams, there is growth to be made in terms of the quality and accountability of team planning structures.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
 

By June 2019, 100% of teams will have planning meetings that score "Highly Effective" in the Framework for 
Instructional Conversations*, as measured by scored transcripts of randomly selected teacher team meetings.

In the most recent School Survey, 98% of teachers say that the principal makes clear to the staff his or her 
expectations for meeting instructional goals. In the Quality Review, in response to, "How clearly are high expectations 
communicated to 
students and staff? (3.4)," the school scored effective. Growth is possible in this element too, however, as indicated 
by the 87% of teachers who agreed or strongly agreed that their school has well-defined learning expectations for all 
students. (Q6h).

In order to recruit staff for our growing new school, we posted all vacancies on the Department of Education website. 
We attended various recruitment fairs around the city meeting with energetic and driven individuals. We also found 
potential candidates through the New Teacher Finder database and by reaching out to schools we admired who 
employed Teaching Assistants with full certification. 

Our entire staff is deeply involved in the collaborative hiring process.

Once candidates were deemed qualified to be considered for a position, teachers were then interviewed as part of 
the Immersion day by the panel members. Each candidate was scored using a committee created rubric aligned to our 
school’s vision and mission. Each candidate’s references, employee history and certifications were checked. All 
educators hired demonstrated mastery in the subject area they are teaching and have a deep understanding of the 
real-world application and its impact on students for middle, high school, college and beyond. All teachers are 
committed to the empowerment of each child’s best self, as well as preparation for college and careers.

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
At our school, more than 80% of our students qualify for free or reduced lunch and 25% of our students are living in 
transitional housing. A full day Pre-K program offers systematic structure and consistency which supports our 
youngest learners in their social, emotional and academic development. Our Crown Heights neighborhood has many 
daycare programs which provide working families with non-academic child care, but as educators we believe that a 
student’s experience in a Common Core aligned, academically rich Pre-K program is the key for setting our students 
up for academic and social success as they enter Kindergarten. Maximizing a student’s time in an engaging, inclusive, 
and scholastic classroom at New Bridges Elementary gives them the strong start for their time here and a lifetime of 
learning and growth – and we look forward to welcoming this year’s Kindergarten class from our over 75 Pre-K 
students served in 5 early childhood classrooms this year. 

Pre-K students will not have any questions when they enter our Kindergarten rooms for the first time the following 
September. We eliminate the mystery or fear of transitioning by offering miniature “field trips” in which Pre-K 
students join a Kindergarten room for a period of the day. They get to ask and answer questions, observe the room 
around them, and start to become familiar with the changes they will soon face. We work to create a welcoming 
culture for families by offering an open house back to school night, in which new Kindergarten families are welcomed 
into classrooms and are briefed in the academic, social, and emotional curriculum that their children will engage in. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Through the MOSL committee, Coordinator Cabinet, and in collaborative planning at the Grade Level, all teachers are 
involved in decision making and ongoing collaboration around the use of assessments. Teachers participate in both 
the selection of these tools, and ongoing professional development and collaborative learning about how best to use 
these tools to drive instruction.  

Driven by our belief that all students can learn and that it is necessary to do whatever it takes to pursue that purpose, 
we always ask ourselves “what do we want students to have learned?”, “why do want them to learn it?”, and “how 
will we know when they have learned it?” With this information we are able to intentionally plan and design whole 
class, small group, and individualized instruction which meets the needs of all students. At New Bridges, student 
achievement is assessed and tracked in ways that are common and consistent across grade teams and vertically 
aligned from grade to grade. In this way, we are able to always focus on results, planning and modifying instruction 
and responding to the needs of all of our learners, in order to most effectively drive student achievement.  

In Reading, comprehensive assessments--measuring scholars’ accuracy, fluency, rate, and comprehension--are used 
on a formative and summative basis. The running records we utilize allow teachers to determine students’ 
independent and instructional reading levels, and to get to closely know their students as readers. The independent 
level--the level at which scholars can and should be practicing the skills they learn in all their literacy-driven 
experiences throughout the school day, and the instructional level, at which scholars are pushed and challenged while 
working directly with teachers in guided reading groups, are essential to our literacy instruction. The running records 
are administered both quarterly and as New Bridges scholars appear to their teachers to be ready to progress to the 
next level. Besides the running records, which are holistic reading inventories, we also utilize assessments such as 
concepts of print, letter-sound lists, high-frequency sight word lists, decoding inventories, and rubric-graded writing 
about reading. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

With Reading assessments as well as with Math baseline, midyear, and End of Year assessments, and “On Demand” 
CCLS writing assessments, teachers engage in professional development and collaborative analysis to plan instruction. 

Professional Development in analysis of the F&P Running Records is provided through Teachers College Reading and 
Writing Project, and of the Math MOSL through our Math Partnership with National Training Network. Professional 
Development is also ongoing during Monday afternoons and collaborative planning meetings and is facilitated by 
teacher leaders and administration.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 17K532 in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

New Bridges Elementary will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

New Bridges created a newcomers group where newcomers to the country (0-6 months) meet in 
a linguistically homogeneous group in terms of English proficiency (but not native language) in 
order to gain early literacy skills and adjust to school and life in the United States. The purpose 
of this group is to provide as much support as possible so that students will be able to glean 
information from their mainstream classes, but also  to introduce students to some of the cultural 
norms. The instructional language of the program is in English and facilitated by a fully 
certified(K-12) ESL teacher with a Common Branch (1-6) licenses.  The ENL instruction is 
within a balanced literacy framework.  We teach word features and high frequency words in 
isolation, build and solve words putting word features together, model strategies and provide 
direct instruction in vocabulary through level appropriate text, and ensure the application of 
skills into reading and writing, shared reading, guided reading, interactive writing. Newcomers 
engage in discussions using sentence frames, new vocabulary, and building on ideas. This 
foundational skill building gives students confidence they need to read, write, and speak English. 
We use parts of  Fundations, Preventing Academic Failures, Leveled Literacy Intervention, 
Teachers College Reading and Writing programs to develop a comprehensive program from our 
newcomers. The PAF and Leveled Literacy Intervention programs are supplemental programs 
that provides materials that will support language growth. We use the New Language Arts 
Progression standards for planning, printable resources, leveled paper choice, and graphic 
organizers for additional support. The newcomers group will meet during the afterschool time 
from 3:00 PM - 4:15pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Students will be invited based on 
NYSITELL and NYSESLAT results. We will analyze classroom data such as running records, 
teachers’ conferring notes, and how well students are able to interact in class with grade level 
content. Parents will receive invite notifications in the language indicated on their home 
language identification survey. As notices are given and received we will maintain records in an 
ENL binder along with student attendance.

by administrators or staff.  Mainstream ELL teachers will also have opportunities to register for 
professional development opportunities outside of the school. They will come back and turn-key 
information so that the entire ELL community can benefit from these workshops. 
Teachers of ELLs currently participating in weekly professional development through a cycle of 
grade team meetings, and after school professional developments in which practices to support 
ELLs are discussed. Additional ELL workshop series will be offered to teachers that are based 
on supporting the growth of teachers and ELLs. These meetings are facilitated through either our 
ENL Coordinator Sarah Heredia, Principal Mr. Bowles, Assistant Principal Sophia Tkac. These 
PD's take place every Monday from 3pm- 4:40pm, during grade team on Wednesdays for 50 min 
blocks, and an hour fter school on dates scheduled for additional support.  Meeting topics include 
strategies to support ELLs, Co-teaching, Building Academic Literacy, Enhancing ELL 
instruction in integrated classrooms, using the NLAP to plan read-alouds. 
Additional Title III funded PD opportunities for the General Education teachers of ELL students 
will happen as per session meetings after school on Wednesdays, planned and facilitated by the 
ENL Coordinator on best instructional practices for ELLs. The agendas, powerpoints, sign in 
sheets, and materials for all professional developments will be maintained on New Bridges

This school year, New Bridges will offer a series of "Bilingual Family Workshops".  These 
workshops will be geared to parents of ELL students and opened to any parent that can use the 
language support.  The focus of these workshops will be to introduce various strategies and 
activities that parents will have an opportunity to create, practice,and take home to support 
students academically at home. 
At these workshops we will also  "Show" rather than "tell" about our current curriculum and give 
parents an opportunity to ask questions in their native language.  These workshops will be 
provided by our ENL Coordinator, Ms. Sarah Heredia with supporting staff who can translate. 
Many workshops will be in partnership with the parent coordinator Ms. Beth, and the PTA. Each 
workshop will last for an hour and parents will be notified about workshops through parent 
notices translated in preferred languages and courtesy phone calls. 
Title III funds will be used to ensure translation through per session fund or through a contracted 
translation vendors, materials for parents to make and take at-home supports for working with 
their students, and minimal, light refreshments for parents who attend. 
The agendas, powerpoints, sign in sheets, and materials for all professional developments will be 
maintained on New Bridges google drive, in addition to the ENL binder that holds and paper

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses Fountas and Pinnell running records to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs. We also supplement Fountas 
and Pinnell with TCRWP concepts of print assessment and spelling assessments. The data shows that our ELLs are able to use 
oral and verbal cues to identify items, but struggle to use context within a text to acccess information. This data will inform our 
instruction by helping us define our aims, developing academic language, and questioning that will be used during leveled 
literacy intervention groups as well as in guided reading.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

The culture of reflection and growth is a part of our everyday practice at New Bridges. At the end of each "learning cycle," we 
have a data analysis meeting in which we study the results of our running records (Fountas and Pinnell tests, letter sound 
assessments, sight word assessment, and interim assessments in math). We analyze the successes of each of our ELLs and 
identify the instruction that we can link to those successes. We also analyze the breakdowns in understanding and the teacher 
or school actions that contributed to those breakdown. Once we've analyzed where we need to go, we use that data to inform 
our new cycle of instruction and design teaching points and conferring notes based on that data. Additionally, we have a 
NYSESLAT analysis meeting in which we study the results of our ELLs and identify learning goals based on areas in which they 
struggled. We also compare the scores of NYSESLAT/ benchmarks on the exams to the results from this Spring so we may 
assess where our programming is best serving students and where we can work to be better.        
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 In implementing RtI approaches with ELLs, a significant challenge is determining students' knowledge and skills in their first 
language and then understanding their performance in their second language (English). For example, there are subgroups of 
students whose literacy knowledge and skills in their first language (e.g., Spanish) are adequate, but whose literacy skills in 
their second language (English) are low. These students have demonstrated the capacity to acquire reading skills and now 
require instruction so they can apply those skills to the acquisition of English literacy. Other students may have low literacy in 
both their first language and English because they have not received adequate instruction in either language. Still another 
group of students, the smallest group, demonstrates low literacy skills in both their first language and English even after 
receiving adequate instruction. Currently, our school regularly collects data every day in the classroom. From observational 
notes to more formal running records or assessments, we have a lot of information to work with as we develop targeted 
intervention through small grouping, push in and pull out services.. Our school will work within the RtI framework to support 
instruction by strengthening core instruction through coaching. We will develop our teachers to develop langauge and literacy 
across curriculum and integrate meaningful lessons in which students partner with teachers to produce meaningful work.      
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Based on the NYSESLAT T and NYSITELL performance levels  indicate that our ELLs face significant challenges in reading and 
listening, but are having greater success in Speaking and Writing.  This information has helped us ut in some key next steps 
that will further push instrusction and language development with our ENL students.  Restructuring writing rubrics to align 
with state exams, focusing on tiered comprehension questioning during reading and shared reading, and pushing the use of 
academic langauge through accountable talk and opportunities to practice language through writing and speaking. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ESL provider collaborates in Monday PD and Wednesday collaborative planning meetings with each of her "co-teachers" 
across the grade levels who have ELLs in their classrooms. During our Data Meetings and Looking at Student Work protocols, 
she brings this focus to the collaborative teacher team conversations.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The ELLs at our school (grades K-5th) receive Push-In/Pull-Out ESL services. All expanding students receive 180 
minutes of ESL instruction per week and all entering, emerging, and transitioning students receive 360 minutes of ESL 
instruction per week regardless of the model of services that they recieve. Push-In ESL periods involve a Co-Teaching 
model where the mainstream teacher and the ESL teacher collaborate in order to provide scaffolded, differentiated 
instruction, and parallel reading instruction. The two teachers plan together in order to ensure students' needs are 
met and that lessons are adapted so that they reach our ELLs.   
Additionally, New Bridges  currently uses the Teachers College curriculum program. The program provides explicit 
instruction in all four English modalities: listening, speaking, reading and writing. Class discussion and structured 
partner talk are highly scaffolded components of this program and the use of projectable resources provide visual 
supports that are particularly helpful for ELLs. This curriculum is being utilized school-wide (K-4) with the hopes that 
students will be supported throughout their entire elementary school experience. This curriculum also provides 
valuable resources and methods of adapting content so that while in maintream classes ELLs will still have access to 
content that is being taught.  This curriculum is aligned with the common core standards and it encourages teachers 
to focus on consistent assessment practices in order to group students and plan for future instruction. Additionally, 
the curriculum caters to various learning styles in order to try and reach all students. Different kinds of visuals such as 
pictures and projectable materials cater to visual learners while the incorporation of music caters to auditory learners. 
Explicit grammar instruction embedded in guided reading, word study, and interavtive writing is also part of the daily 
curriculum at New Bridges.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

              Paste response to questions here:    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Here at New Bridges we use the workshop model to deliver lessons: I, We , You, so that students have a chance to watch a 
model of an objective, have a time with guided instruction have a chance to practice, and independently digest and produce 
work.Within the workshop models teachers provide visual support along with language support. Students use partner talk and 
partner reading for additional peer support.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We make sure that students are assessed in the language in which they best understand and can produce the most amount of 
meaningful work.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. SIFE: When a SIFE student returns to school, they are given a brief informal assessment of their basic skills and knowledge of 
English. The student is reintroduced to the classroom environment through displaying language and content objectives and 
presenting information in varied ways (written, demonstrations, manipulatives). Once the student feels comfortable in his/her 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

classroom environment, they follow the structured ELL program that is currently in place. If there is a need for extra tutoring, 
the ESL teacher meets with the student’s content teacher and discusses areas for improvement and possible meetings for the 
student. 
b. Newcomers: ELLs who are in United States schools fewer than 3 years take part in a newcomers program their first year. The 
main focus here is to adapt to the classroom environment, develop their basic English vocabulary, and begin Fundations with 
their content area teacher and with the ESL teacher. After their first year, the program changes to fit the student, addressing 
any academic weaknesses. Focus is then placed on utilizing the skills acquired in their first year to develop stronger abilities as 
a reader and writer of English. 
c. ELLs receiving 4-6 years of service: Students participate in their chosen ESL program, working with the ESL teacher on 
developing stronger reading and writing skills. At this point, most ELLs are either advanced or proficient in the listening and 
speaking modalities. All four modalities are addressed in most activities, but deficiencies are more prevalent in reading and 
writing in English. Making predictions, inferences, brainstorming lists, and asking questions about the text help ELLs 
understand the material. Making outlines, creating charts and using graphic organizers are evident in ESL instruction. 
d. Long Term ELLs: Looking at data and conferencing with content area teachers will help create a profile for these ELLs. If 
needed, teachers will arrange tutoring sessions throughout the school day to pinpoint and address any issue the student is 
having with a particular concept/content area. We will supoport our former ELLs by carefully monitoring their academic 
progress at each term and reflecting on structures we can input into their classrooms to maintain their growth.  Testing 
accommodations for former ELLs are dependent on the student's learning needs and will be individually determined by the ELL 
Suport Team before the beginning of each testing cycle.     
E:Former ELLS receive push in support.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELLs who have special needs are part of the Push-In instructional ESL program; the only ELL with special needs at our school is 
on an advanced level so she will receive 360 minutes of combined Push-In time per week. ELLs with special needs will be 
grouped with students on their grade level and with students at their proficiency level for ESL instructional time. ELLs' IEPs are 
always taken into account in order to ensure that instruction that is being provided is consistent with students' needs.       
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In efforts to provide services within the least restrictive environment, students with disabilities are mainstreamed with 
students in general education classes on their grade level for ESL services for 360 minutes per week.          
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All intervention services are offered in English. We provide after school Mondays through Thursdays in literacy and reading to 
help students develop their foundational reading skills (letter sounds, blends). Every Friday classroom teachers support 
students in math intervention by pulling small groups and doing a re-teach of a lesson that was not mastered. Students are 
pulled into targeted centers based on their mastery of the lessons taught that day.     
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 In the upcoming school year, there will be a NYSESLAT prep after school program, in which we will provide additional help in 
listening, speaking, reading and writing in English. In addtion there is a Newcomers beginners group that is an additional 30 
mins in the morning to help students in basic English skills.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

All students, including ELLs, are welcome and do participate in any and all programs in our fully inclusive schools.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All students, including ELLs have access to computer time in their classrooms as well as a diverse and rich student library. 
Teachers have been given access to a website called "Reading A-Z" which offers books in both Spanish and English. Word wall 
words posted around the room are posted in both Spanish and English.  The interactive reading website, Starfall, which is used 
during centers time, that gives students access to readin programs in Spanish and English. Phonemic awareness is necessary 
for EL students in order to demonstrate an understanding for the linguistic characteristics of English.  This supports ELD 
standards as well as builds foundational reading skills, IMAGINE.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support for students in the ESL program is delivered through using a cognate word wall, and culturally 
relevant texts that may incorportate foreign language words into mostly English writing so that students can connect to English 
books. Explicit use of the native language during instructional time only occurs when absolutely necessary within the 
framework of the ESL class, and usually with new-arrivals to the school in order to ease their early experiences at the school, if 
the teacher general ed teacher speaks the native language.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Every students is supplied with materials and resourses based on their needs as learners 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
All students, including ELLs have access to computer time in their classrooms as well as a diverse and rich student library. 
Teachers have been given access to a website called "Reading A-Z" which offers books in both Spanish and English. Word wall 
words posted around the room are posted in both Spanish and English.  The interactive reading website, Starfall, which is used

for EL students in order to demonstrate an understanding for the linguistic characteristics of English.  This supports ELD 
standards as well as builds foundational reading skills, IMAGINE.    
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Because we do not know the language status of students prior to administering the NYSITEL and LABR, we do not have any 
activities prior to the beginning of the school year.  Once students are identified, they participate in a "Newcomers 
Group"were they are introduced to the the schooling style and structure of the instructional day in the United States.   e:    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
In addition to professional development workshops held regularly at the school , all ELL personnel participate in Teacher’s 
College Workshops once a month, as well as ELL meetings held by the district . Also, ESL staff takes part in the school cabinet. 
The purpose of the school cabinet is to discuss instructional strategies and methods that would address any academic 
difficulties for all students, including ELLs. Our parent coordianot,  common branches teachers, guidance counselors, and 
secretaries will participate in professional development sessions across the year. Professional development will be afterschools 
on Tuesdays every other month.  
2. Each Wednesday grade teams have a collaborative planning meeting led by the academic coach who offers specific literacy, 
math, and other coaching related to grade wide needs, including those of ELL students. This coaching is aligned with common 
core learning standards and can focus on how to meet the needs of ELLs as they are workign to engage with the common core 
learning standards.  
3. The ESL staff must attend each individual grade level meeting once a month to discuss ELL progress and how the content 
area teachers can further develop the students academic and language proficiency. The meetings are designed to enable 
communication between the principal and pedagogues about various topics, including transitioning students into middle 
school. Our guidance counselor will partner with ELL providers at the local middle school to beginning developing our 
understanding of how to create a smooth and successful transition. The guidance counselor will turnkey this information to 
teachers during professional development sessions on how to set up for a successful transition. 
4. There are regular professional development workshops held for all teachers at the school. The ELL training workshops will 
take place once every two months. They address topics ranging from literacy, informal and formal assessments to translating 
NYSESLAT data into effective instruction for all levels. Records of these workshops and trainings will be recording the by ESL 
support team.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kevin Bowles, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources

If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting.

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The ATS report, RCPL, is generated and reviewed to determine the home languages of students. Informal 
assessment is also conducted. Administrators, supervisors, teachers, PPS staff, and LAB/BESIS Coordinator are 
surveyed to determine the most common home languages of our students. The school collects data (Home 
Language Survey) regarding the primary language spoken by the parent/guardian of each newly enrolled student 
and whether the parent/guardian requires language assistance to communicate with the school. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

We utilize a mobile connection device called School CNXT which provides translated, instant communication.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Information was presented in Summer PD and will be presented again in quarterly Monday PDs. Information has also 
been communicated in the Staff Handbook and the Bulletin.

Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

While English, at 82%, is the dominant home language of our students and families, we provide translated signs and 
posters, as well as have Spanish-speaking staff members available in the Main Office of the school building to facilitate 
the immediate provision of translated information to parents.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We will utilize a parent survey to gather feedback from our non-English speaking parents and families on the quality 
and availability of services. The ESL Coordinator, who is also our Language Access Coordinator, will facilitate 1:1 
checkins with families in order to gather additional qualitative feedback to adapt, modify, and improve our language 
and translation services.
