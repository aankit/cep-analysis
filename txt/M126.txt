Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

School’s Mission and Vision: 

We envision our school as a community where kindness and caring is sustained, nourished and benefited by a 
diversity of learners. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

Our goal is to foster a nurturing environment that acknowledges, encourages and expects our students to be 
rigorously as well as joyfully involved in reading, writing, mathematics, science, technology, and history on a daily 
basis with the constant integration of technology. 

All of our students are expected to develop creative and critical thinking abilities, thereby becoming capable of 
flexible problem solving and independent learning in all content areas. 

 

We will accomplish this by: 

• Promoting ongoing communication to extend and connect learning between school and home 

• Expecting accountability for student achievement from parents, staff and students 

• Providing assessment driven Standards-based instructional model 

To every extent possible PS126/Manhattan Academy of Technology will create the proper environment and 
pedagogical modifications to ensure that all children will succeed. 

Our theory of action to reach our mission statement is centered on creating a school culture where teachers feel free 
to take risks, share student work, and open up their practice, what we call a “permanent state of thoughtful revision.” 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
PS126/Manhattan Academy of Technology is located on the Lower East Side, bordered by the Smith House Projects, 
Chinatown and Knickerbocker Village. Our population reflects the diversity of the neighborhood, including students 
from Tribeca in our Middle School. We are a PreK-8 school with 786 students. The school’s population is comprised of 
9% Black, 18% Hispanic, 8% White and 62% Asian students and 3% multi-racial.  

 

Building this culture for the adults in the building supports teachers in creating curricula that kids are excited to learn 
and that teachers own. We hold Ron Berger’s AN ETHIC OF EXCELLENCE as an example of creating curricula that 
includes supports for all students to reach the same standards. Our Social Studies work and self-portraiture work are 
examples of this work K-8. 

 

The five pedagogical practices that we emphasize through our action plan is derived from Berger’s (2006) 

work are: 

1. Assign work that matters 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

2. Study examples of excellence 

3. Build a culture of critique 

4. Require multiple revisions 

5. Provide opportunities for pubic presentation 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The student body includes 16.5% English Language Learners and 19% Special Education students. The specific needs 
of the ELL population are a language rich environment, immersion in a balanced literacy program, exposure to 
academic vocabulary, cultural texts and experiences. The specific needs of Student With Disabilities are small group 
differentiated instruction, hands on multi-sensory approach to learning, exposure to high interest texts, and 
scaffolded learning. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

When thinking about the many initiatives of our school, we organized them (as a challenge to our thinking) within the 
capacity framework; therefore we could see areas of strength and weakness and also how some initiatives fall under a 
several frameworks. 

 

Our biggest HIGHLIGHT is SHARING. We are a school with a huge focus on sharing practice across disciplines and 
grades; building a consistent belief system about how students learn best and what supports ensure all students 
reaching the same standard. If you read the list below, the pattern that emerges is one of community building, joy in 
teaching and learning; and only as a community can this be achieved.

cyclical throughout the year – that encourage teachers to learn 
something new and apply the learning process to their own teaching. 
Develop uniform rubrics that are clearly aligned to the CCLS. Rubrics 
are made together with Teachers and students and are shared with

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

Based on the School Quality Review and our Administrative observations we determined the need to provide 
actionable feedback that is “user-friendly” for all students and equipping all students' ability to fully realize their 
potential. The rubrics will be written using language that enables students to interpret and articulate feedback. 

 

● Based on the School Quality Review and our Administrative observations our strengths show that many school-wide 
practices create an expectation of self-reflection and feedback. The following practices under "Rigorous Instruction" 
are: Vertical Planning, Using consultants, Teacher collaboration, and Reflective practice. In addition, under 
"Collaborative Teachers" we exhibit other strengths: Use of classroom observations, creating equitable grading 
policies, ongoing think tanks, professional development. These practices support our goal of creating students who 
are highly articulate about their work in terms of their learning and presenting their work publicly. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

By June 2019, teachers will create 5 rubrics aligned to their units of study across all content areas. The purpose of the 
rubrics is to communicate expected learning outcomes for students, to foster student ownership of their learning, and 
to increase student achievement. The effectiveness of these rubrics will be measured by 75% of the students showing 
improvement in three parts of the rubric.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers will meet in grade and department team meetings that 
focus around student work highlighting strengths and 
weaknesses to create rubrics that are student friendly (keeping in 
mind English Language Learners and Special Education students); 
enabling them to reflect on the quality of work throughout the 
process.

Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
According to the Cumulative Absence/Lateness Report (RCUA) for the 2017 - 2018 school year, 99 out of 786 students 
(12.4%) have 15 or more latenesses. Based on this information we determined the need to reduce lateness/absences 
by reaching out to families and facilitating workshops.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

By June 2019, as a result of the school-wide efforts, there will be a 4% reduction in students' lateness as measured by 
the 2018 - 2019 ATS attendance/lateness reports, compared to the 2017-2018 ATS attendance/lateness reports. The 
school will utilize the NYC DOE attendance teacher, teacher records, iLog records, daily parent outreach, and ATS 
reports to monitor and measure progress.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

According to the 2017-2018 classroom observation data, review of the New York State item analysis, and the 
examination of student work with teachers and administrators, there is need to develop a system of collecting data 
that uncovers student needs and student potential. We will use this information to revise instructional plans that 
highlight the shifts in classroom practice to meet and exceed instructional benchmarks.  

The school's culture is collaboration through conversations among the staff that results in a dynamic curriculum, a 
close examination of student work, an in-depth understanding of how to align instruction to standards, and a learning 
environment for students that is both rigorous and nurturing. 

According to the 2015-2016 School Quality Snapshot, 98% of teachers say that they work together to design 
instruction. 

Based on observational data, students’ reading logs, and conversations with teachers, staff developers, and students, 
we uncovered a need to increase student choice and exposure to a variety of texts. 

Based on our five pedagogical practices, we want to build upon students’ skills, strategies, and content knowledge. 
Students will respond to texts in a more meaningful, purposeful, collaborative way, and engage in current events. 
These texts will be used as a communication tool, as well as fostering sophisticated language, complex thinking, and 
increase exposure to texts and independent reading stamina. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, school wide assessments will be administered 3 times throughout the year. (F&P, ELA, and Math) By 
February 2019, 50% of students will be meeting benchmarks in these areas. Based on this evidence, teachers will revise 
their instructional plans to meet or exceed the needs of students. By June 2019, 70% of the students will be meeting or 
exceeding bench mark standards in the areas of ELA and Math.

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 
 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S 126, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 126, will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
 
Activity 1: The Dragon Express – School Newspaper Class 
The target population is sixth through eighth Grade ELLs and recent former ELLs, taught by one 
certified ESL teacher in English. The program's schedule is Thursdays from 2:45-4:15 from 
10/4/18 to 6/13/19 with 15 ELLs participating ranging from Entering (1), Emerging (4), 
Transitioning (3) and Expanding (7) running for 20 weeks.  Based on data from both the 
NYESELAT and the State ELA tests, ELLs need to improve their non-fiction writing skills. 
ELLs range from Transitioning to Expanding. Writing for a newspaper and having their peers 
read it will motivate the students to do their best.    
Budding journalists will learn about starting a school newspaper by meeting once a week for an 
hour and a half to learn the fundamentals of journalism, page layout and design, and publishing. 
Students will choose the stories to write about and gain important writing skills by editing and 
revising multiple drafts to perfect their writing so it can be published.  They will benefit from 
having a real audience and purpose for their accurate writing. Students will conduct interviews 
with teachers, administrators, parents, and other students as part of research for articles in the 
newspaper. Asking adults questions (that they have created) can be a challenge for English 
Language Learners, but they will be using academic English to both write interview questions 
and write their findings.  Students will take pictures of events going on at our school to go along 
with their stories, and create captions for the photographs. We will also have an original comic 
strip utilizing both English and their native Chinese language. This will increase their writing 
skills and ultimately give them the skill of grant writing for the future. 
Students will work out a budget, honing their math and financial literacy skills, which play an 
important role in developing the next generation of responsible leaders. Then the students will 
work on marketing and advertising the newspaper through posters. This year-long program also 
promotes grit and perseverance in the students because it takes a lot of time and hard work to 
finally see their newspaper come to fruition. Parents will be interviewed and asked questions for 
quotes about the topics in our newspaper, as well as possibly purchasing advertising space for 
their businesses. Due to time and cost, we will publish our newspaper twice a year.   
The school will provide the program with IPads, Laptops, a camera and publishing software to 
support the needs of the program.   
Rationale: Finding authentic and meaningful writing exercises can be difficult for English 
Language Learners. Starting a school newspaper gives students an opportunity that few students 
have. They have to solve real-world problems, meet their deadlines and manage a budget for 
supplies. Students learn that the quality and timeliness of their work affects everyone on the 
newspaper staff.  Students will devise their own questions for different people about the various 
topics and stories the newspaper will cover and conduct the interviews in English and Chinese 
when necessary. The teacher will emphasize academic English writing strategies that can be 
applied to their class work and improve their writing during exams.  
Activity 2: Academic English Enrichment through Video 
The target population is sixth to eighth grade ELLs taught by one certified ESL teacher. The 
program's schedule is Wednesday's from 2:45-4:15, starting 12/5/18 through 6/15/19 for 25 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
sessions. The language of instruction is English. Students are current ELLs, 10 in the program; 
students in the program are Entering (2), Emerging (1), Transitioning (2), and Expanding (5). 
Students are shown different ways of telling a story through film and how to create their own 
short videos.  Materials to be purchased are video editing apps, notebooks, pens, markers, 
pencils, book binder and binders, card stock, puppet making supplies, chart paper, and 
storyboards.  Techniques include interviewing, stop motion, how to's and drama.  Students learn 
how to be a camera person, actor/ interviewer, director and editor.  Students use iPads to film all 
of the work.  Students are taught the process of creating short films: planning (scripts, set design, 
order of filming), shooting (multiple takes) and editing (adding sound, putting the shots in order, 
additional audio dubbing.)  Students work in groups of three to five to create their short 
movies.  Students will practice making documentaries, personal narratives, and creative stories. 
Rationale: Students’ language repertoires are important to who they are.  Being able to learn to 
express themselves and share with others is important.  Students that might be shyer in a 
classroom setting are more open when working in small groups and able to edit their own work 
with editing software and using multiple takes.  The skills needed to create and edit videos are 
similar to the writing process used in ELA and other subjects by planning, writing and 
editing.  Additionally, being both in front of the camera and behind it will help students with all 
modalities in the NYSESLAT, reading, writing, speaking and listening.  The styles of films made 
will use similar vocabulary to classroom content (documentaries will be about science or social 
studies topics with vocabulary skill that will provide transferable vocabulary to those subject 
areas; stop motion and dramas will use the film making process which mirrors the writing 
process.)  They will be focusing on both fictional and real stories and these areas need more 
development as indicated by review of ELA scores. These students got scores ranging from 1-3 
on the 2018 ELA test.  This program will help them build their English language that can be 
directly transferred to their classrooms. 
 
Activity 3: Academic English Enrichment through Orienteering 9/21-10/26 and 2/15-6/7/19 
The PS126/MAT Orienteering Program for ELLS is aimed at serving fourth through eighth 
grade ELLs. It is taught by one certified ENL teacher in English, with 8- 12 ELLs participating: 
ranging from Entering to Commanding proficiency levels. The PS 126/MAT Orienteering 
program is an after-school program that takes place on Wednesdays and lasts for one and a half 
hours (2:45-4:15), in the fall from 9/21 to 10/26 and spring from 2/15-6/7 for a total of 25 weeks 
Through orienteering at PS126/MAT, 4th-8th grade ELL students will enhance their academic 
skills in all four modalities: reading, writing, listening and speaking. Students will research and 
explore the surrounding neighborhood, highlighting its historic as well as everyday features. 
They will write about, compare, and be able to present, on the Brooklyn, Manhattan, and 
Williamsburg, bridges. 
Ells will expand their vocabulary while learning the useful, sophisticated and intuitive aspects of 
orienting and navigating through maps. Students will learn how to read important symbols on a 
map and relate them to the corresponding aspects of their surrounding neighborhood; they will 
learn about contours and topography.  As students become familiar with the basics of navigating 
and map reading, they will create their own map of a nearby area. This will enable students to 
also expand their mathematics academic vocabulary. They will be able to create a graph to 
represent the varying contours of their map. This will include measuring and putting to scale a 
nearby area and the objects within it. A written and verbal presentation at the culmination of the 
program will further enhance academic and speaking skills. 
Rationale: The program offers ELLs an opportunity to excel academically while communicating 
and exploring with peers and teachers outside of the traditional classroom school environment. 
The program gives ELLs a strong sense of identity by linking academic skills through the 4 
modalities of English: Reading, Writing, Listening and Speaking, to real life experience of their 
own environs.  Learning the commonly used terms and phrases used in state math, social studies,

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
and ELA tests is an important and necessary skill for ELLs.  Participating ELLs learn hands-on 
how to measure and graph, and how to present their findings to their peers. This will help 
students in the NYSESLAT, Science, Math and ELA tests by using appropriate academic 
English to communicate concepts in writing and speaking.  The program fosters a team 
atmosphere.

Bank Street 2018 Language Series: Multiple Pathways to Learning in the Age of Accountability 
Professional Development for 3 certified ENL teachers.  The 2018 Language Series explores 
teaching methods designed to support educators who are seeking to enhance their practice in 
spite of prevailing, one-dimensional accountability pressures. The focus will be on student 
engagement in both language and content development through multiple pathways: music, 
project based learning, multimodal literacy, and others.  It takes place Saturday October 27, 2018 
from 8:00am to 4:00pm.  The cost of this professional development is $195 per teachers.   
The 6 certified TESOL instructors will attend professional development through the Department 
of Literacy and AIS Academic Intervention Team Speaker Series including: (These 
learning opportunities are free of charge and teachers will choose three to attend)

Rationale: All of these professional development opportunities further the teachers’ 
understanding of different ELL populations (Entering through Expanding, struggling readers and 
writers) and teach them up-to-date skills that can be immediately applied in the classroom 
throughout the subject areas through the four modalities of reading, writing, listening, and 
speaking.  They are all approved CTLE providers.

Begin description here:            
A series of How to Help Your Child Academically From Home will be provided on the 
following Wednesdays: 3/1, 3/22, 4/5 from 2:45-3:45.  Parents will be invited via letters home in 
both English and their Home Language.  The first session will be how to help with homework 
when you do not know much English, the second sessions is how to use technology in the home 
to support your child's education, and the third session is how to support your child through the 
NYSESLAT from home.  We will have an interpreter to translate the workshop and questions of 
parents.  All parents of ELLs will be invited.  This will be a per session series for the ENL 
teachers. 
Activity 1: The Dragon Express – school newspaper class 
Parents will be interviewed by students to get quotes for our articles in both English and their 
Home Language. Students will create their own questions to ask parents about their opinions or 
expertise on a certain subject that will be written about in the newspaper. We will ask parents 
who are in the business field to put an advertisement in our newspaper, designed by the students 
and parents together.  Students will be practicing English and writing both nonfiction and 
fictional articles through the interviewing and writing process.  These are ongoing throughout the 
school year while the paper is being written, 10/4/18-6/13/19.  Student will both do this on their 
own time and invite parents into the school.  An ENL certified teacher is holding this program.   
Activity 2:   Academic English Enrichment through Video and Film 
Parents will be invited to movie nights via letters home in both English and their Home 
Language by the certified ENL teacher.  After several movies have been made parents will be 
invited to movie night where the students will show their parents their films, one on 2/13/19 and 
one on 6/12/19, both from 3;00-4:30.  Parents will have the opportunity to ask the directors and 
movie makers (students) questions.  
Activity 3: Academic English Enrichment through Orienteering 
Parents will be invited via letters home in both English and their Home Language by the certified 
ENL teacher and will accompany the orienteers on neighborhood exploration. Students and 
parents will teach each other what they know about orienting and navigating through maps.

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At P.S. 126/MAT, we use Fountas and Pinnell from grades K-8 to measure early literacy skills of our ELLs. The data provide us 
with insight into the reading proficiency level, fluency, and comprehension skills of each student. They also provide us with 
more data with which to program our students into their ENL program, teacher, and schedule. We use these F&P scores to 
group our students into homogenous groups for ENL instruction. Also, these scores let us know the strengths of our students. 
Often, students can be particularly strong in one modality over another. The F&P scores combined with the NYSESLAT scores 
give us a clearer, rounded picture of our ELLs. This is used to individually assess all students’ reading levels four times a 
year.  Once these levels are obtained, students are placed in the appropriately leveled guided reading groups. These groups 
are fluid and change over the course of the school year depending on the strengths and weaknesses of the students.  First 
grade students are also assessed using the Reading Rescue Program’s Classwide Screening Assessments of Emergent 
Literacy.  This identifies low-performing students who will be served in the Reading Rescue tutoring program. It also gathers 
baseline data for all students at the beginning of the year and helps track student progress at midpoint and again at the end of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

the year.  The data is shared with classroom teachers in order for them to be able to plan and utilze strategies for their ENL 
students.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teachers assess student three times a year, using the data to establish a baseline and determine progress.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At P. S. 126, we evaluate the success of our ENL program through the use of the AMAO tool provided by the DOE, our Fountas 
and Pinnell levels, the scores from the NYSESLAT, as well as the scores from the ELA and Math tests. With the AMAO tool, we 
are able to see growth across grade levels each year. We are also able to analyze patterns, group students by various 
subgroups, and verify whether or not our program is successful through the growth of our students as seen in the AMAO tool. 
F&P is a resource that we value at P.S. 126 in that we can see growth of our students in reading at 4 different points in the 
school year. The ENL department keeps record of students F&P scores across years to monitor progress and success of our 
program. The NYSESLAT scores that are released each fall provide our program with data on our success in the four modalities. 
We are able to see which modalities to focus on in the year ahead, and in which modalities we are successful. Lastly, the ELA 
and Math test scores provide us with valuable data on how our ELLs fare comparatively in the school. This year, our ELLs did 
not do as well on the ELA test as compared with their peers. In 3rd grade, 70% of our ELLs scored a Level 1, and 30% scored a 
Level 2. In 4th grade, 75% of our ELLs scored a Level 1 and 25% scored a Level 2. In 5th grade, 70% scored a Level 1, 10% a 
Level 2, and 20% a Level 3. In 6th grade, 43% scored a Level 1, 43% scored a Level 2, and 14% scored a Level 3. In 7th grade, 
33% scored a Level 1, 33% a Level 2, and 33% a Level 3. In Math scores, our students fared slightly better than their non-ELL 
peers.  In 3rd grade, 23% of our ELLs scored a Level 1, 31% scored a Level 2, 38% scored a Level 3, and 8% scored at a Level 4. 
In 4th grade, 75% of all P.S. 126/MAT students scored a Level 1, and 25% scored at a Level 2. In 5th grade, 30% scored a Level 
1, 40% scored a Level 2, 20% scored a Level 3, and 10% scored a Level 4. In 6th grade, 28% scored a Level 1, 57% scored a Level 
2, and 14% scored a Level 4. In 7th grade, 33% scored a Level 1, 33% scored a Level 3, and 33% scored a Level 4. Therefore, we 
will be working this year to improve instruction for our ELLs in ELA, specifically in Writing, and we will continue our successful 
instruction in Math.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We provide teachers the data and it is utilized to establish homogeneous reading groups to address specific needs and 
strategies.  Also, we have a partnership with Reading Partners and the data allows for teachers to recommend students to the 
program.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our school uses data within the Response to Intervention (RtI) instructions for ELLs. For Tier I interventions, our school 
strengthens the core instruction in the classroom. ELLs who have F&P scores that fall behind grade level, as well as Beginner 
ELLs and ELLs with a low score in one modality, receive small group instruction in the classroom, have instruction that includes 
a focus on language functions and structures, and receive whole-class instruction that makes lessons meaningful by 
incorporating students background knowledge.  The progress of these students is monitored through F&P scores, as well as 
teacher observations, and the instruction is adjusted as needed. For Tier II interventions, we offer extended day services to our 
ELLs who are also in the lowest 3rd subcategory. Extended day gives students extra instruction in reading and in writing, and 
allows for smaller groups and one-on-one instruction. ELL students deemed at-risk due to low ELA and Math scores from the 
previous year receive extra support in the form of pull out reading and/or math intervention services several times per week 
from a specialist teacher. We use data to inform all decisions regarding RtI procedures. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We have the most ELLs in the lower grades, primarily K-3.  They are also the same grades that have the largest amounts of 
entering and emerging ELLs.  Most students pass the NYSESLAT by fifth or sixth grade. The data patterns across proficiency 
levels and grades reveal that there are certain students who benefit from grouping across grade levels and proficiency levels. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

We make the stand alone ENL groupings by looking at the entire student. The F&P levels, in combination with NYSESLAT and 
NYSITELL scores are used to determine groups for stand alone ENL services. For example, in the 5th and 6th grades, there is a 
group of students that are newcomers at the Entering level and are therefore grouped together for stand alone ENL that is 
ungraded.  Also, a student scored at an Transitioning level on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT, while having a begginer level F&P 
and is therefore placed in a group in which they can receive instruction on their F&P level. Additionally, our Writing scores on 
the NYSESLAT and on the NYSITELL are consistently low across grade levels and proficiency levels. Therefore, we will focus our 
ENL stand alone and integrated services on instruction in writing, particularly for the Expanding students. Graphic organizers 
will be used, along with instruction that consists in vocabulary development specific to academic writing. Students will have 
the opportunity to share their writing with their peers, and receive feedback from both peers and teachers. Long-term and 
short-term writing assignments will be completed so that students can gain experience in the writing process in order to 
become more proficient writers. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Each grade uploads the F & P scores to a Google Document that all teachers have access to, especially our ENL 
teachers.  Teachers are also given a list of the ELL's in their classes along with the students' scores in each of the 
NYSELSAT modalities.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

1a. ENL instruction is delivered by several organizational models at PS 126/MAT by 3 certified ENL teachers.  With our 
entering, emerging and transitioning students, we use both the pull-out model where we take small groups to our 
rooms and give them explicit reading, writing, and language instruction, and the push-in model.  The pull-out groups 
are homogeneous; for the lower elementary grades it is graded by level, and with the upper elementary and middle 
school groups it is both graded and un-graded based on proficiency levels. The ENL teachers also use the push-in 
model for all ELLs entering through expanding and commanding where the ENL teacher goes into the ELLs’ regular 
classroom and works on the content that the classroom teacher is doing.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

Paste response to questions here:    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           There are 3 certified ENL teachers.  One teacher provides service to kindergarten, third grade and sixth grade.  With 
kindergarten and third grade teach pushes-in for 180 minutes to the classrooms.  This ENL teacher teaches Drama to all sixth 
graders for 140 minutes a week. The next teacher provides service to first and second graders.  Each class will be pushed-in to 
for 180 minutes and the entering and emerging will be pulled-out in homogeneous proficiency leveled groups for an additional 
180 minutes.  The third ENL teacher provides service to the third through eighth grades students. Third grade entering and 
emerging students will be pulled-out for 180 minutes.  For the fourth and fifth grade ELLs the ENL teacher will push-in to each 
class for 180 minutes and pull-out the entering and emerging students for an additional 180 minutes by proficiency level.  For 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

the seventh and eighth grade ELLs the ENL teacher will push-in to the social studies classes for 140 minutes a week.  The push-
in time for all three ENL teachers is for entering through commanding ELLs. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 In Pull-Out classes, the ENL teachers provide a variety of strategies to ensure content is comprehensible in English and the 
Common Core Learning Standards are met.  The certified ENL teachers are given pacing calendars by the classroom teachers to 
plan their instruction and include content information and vocabulary that the ELLs will need in their regular classroom.  The 
ENL teachers use visuals, manipulative, and videos to customize the display of information that has already been taught in 
their classroom or will be taught in their classroom.  Picture Dictionaries, Picture word walls, and iPads are used to clarify 
vocabulary, and prompts and sentence starters help clarify syntax and structure.  The ENL teachers activate prior knowledge 
by using concept maps and charts they have created together while discussing students’ experiences.  The ENL teachers use 
both fiction and non-fiction books and topics during Shared Reading, Guided Reading, and Interactive Writing. The non-fiction 
books will be chosen based on each grade’s unit plans.  Skills are explicitly taught to find key ideas and details, identify 
similarities and differences between two texts, and ask and answer important questions. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

 Our school does not offer TBE or Dual Language programs so we do not evaluate ELLs in their native language throughout the 
year.  For new students we administer the LAB-R in Spanish or conduct an interview with the student and parent and 
appropriate translator to establish the literacy level in their first language. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. We currently have 0 SIFE students in our ENL program.  When there is a SIFE student they are introduced to basic school 
routines and structures.  The student participates in a pull-out class that is un-graded, but a homogeneous leveled group of 
Beginners and Intermediate students. The certified ENL teacher sees the student multiple times per week. The certified ENL 
teacher also makes sure to help the classroom teacher simplify directions for that student. Leveled guided reading texts are 
used during a readers workshop model that includes a mini lesson, guided reading, and reflective response. Guided reading 
texts are available in his native language. 
b. There are 127 newcomers. The newcomers are put into homogeneous groups where they interact with their peers who 
speak their native language to lower anxiety.  The smaller group allows them to take more risks while practicing English.  The 
ENL teacher uses each grade level’s pacing calendar to plan specific topics to cover what the regular class will be studying, 
many times working on specific projects in the ENL room with the guidance of the certified ENL teacher. More visuals are used 
and adaptive texts are given where needed.  Supplementary materials are selected to help bridge new content to the students’ 
background knowledge. Guided reading groups are leveled homogeneously in the ENL class.  Materials used are leveled guided 
reading books as per Fountas and Pinnell. The students who have been in school for more than 1 year and are qualified to take 
the ELA test, will be given extra  test prep time to become more comfortable with the testing environment and learn what is 
expected of them. 
c. There are 7 students who have been in ENL for 4-6 years. These ELLs are put in un-graded, somewhat homogeneous leveled 
groups to work on their reading and writing skills, with a focus on explicitly teaching the rules of grammar while still adapting 
any directions to reduce the linguistic complexity.  The certified ENL teacher helps to scaffold meaning and clarify 
information.  We use both pull-out and push-in for this level of student. 
d. We currently have one Long Term ELL who have 7 or more years in ESL.  This student receives push-in instruction by a 
certified ENL teacher. 
e. Recent former ELLs (passed the NYSESLAT within the last two years) are still given accommodations, such as extra time and 
small groups, on standardized tests and performance assessments.  They receive push-in support in their classes for 90 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

minutes a week.  In the middle schools, this push-in is during social studies. They are also welcome to join the various after 
school Title III programs we offer to improve their background knowledge even more.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
There are 14 ELL-SWDs.  The ENL teachers utilize the Universal Design for Learning for ELL-SWDs.  This includes using visuals 
and pictures that trigger schema, graduated scaffolding, embedded prompts to stop and think, checklists, templates, concept 
maps, and mnemonic strategies when applicable.  The ENL teachers work with the classroom teachers in developing this 
differentiation for ELL-SWDs.  Most classes have electronic dictionaries, touch sensitive white board with projectors (similar to 
Smartboards) and laptops or tablets to facilitate learning.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our school offers Integrated Co-Teaching classes in every grade. ELL-SWDs are integrated with students without learning 
disabilities, students who are not ELLs but have learning disabilities, and ELLs without disabilities.  The ENL teacher pulls-out 
ELL-SWDs with ELLs without disabilities to provide the least restrictive environment, yet still follow the IEP and maximize 
learning with the ENL teacher.  We pay careful attention to not overlap ENL with related services. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 Response to Intervention (RTI) is used to identify ELLs at risk for poor learning outcomes, monitor student progress, provide 
evidence-based interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a student’s 
responsiveness, and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities. Targeted interventions for Expanding ELLs 
include the ENL teacher helping to support the content areas of ELA, Math, Social Studies, and Science.  For each ELLs' 
transitioning needs, the ENL teacher works closely with the mainstream teachers to keep up with the schedule and daily 
classroom activities.  Targeted interventions for math include one on one support during math instruction periods, focusing on 
word problems and modeling examples of the process.  The ENL teacher supports the emerging through transitioning ELLs by 
utilizing ENL strategies through small group instruction in pull-out classes.  The ENL students gain confidence in the format and 
routines that occur in the mainstream classroom. The continuity helps support ELLs in reaching the Common Core Learning 
Standards for ELA, Math, Social Studies, and Science.  The Expanding group has more independent time to practice the skills 
and strategies taught both in their mainstream classrooms and in their ENL classes.  The flow between the two classroom 
environments helps the students to bridge from the highly scaffolded ENL environment back to the larger mainstream class 
environment. Integrated language and content instruction provides opportunities for Beginner ELLs to acquire a new language 
through the study of the academic disciplines such as Math, Science, History, and Language Arts.  The middle school students 
also receive additional math classes that are beyond the mandated minutes to support those that need the additional 
support.  When needed, determined case by case, students  will also receive interventions from the additional support staff 
such as OT.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are part of the CUNY NYSIEB (City Universities of New York New York State Initiative on Emergent Bilinguals) in which the 
school continues work to ‘translanguaging’ techniques to be used in the classrooms throughout the school through a statewide 
initiative to improve teaching techniques for ELLs.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We have not discontinued any programs or services for ELLs at PS 126/MAT.    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All students at PS 126/MAT are welcome to join the many after school programs and sports we offer.  Announcements are 
made schoolwide, posters or letters home in multiple languages are displayed or sent home about available

programs.  Starting in 4th grade there are team sports, both competitive and non-competitive, for both boys and girls in 
almost every sport imaginable including bike riding, surfing, soccer, basketball, volleyball, football, wrestling, cheerleading, 
lacrosse, and cross country.   ELLs are also able to attend the 2 after school programs offered by the local YMCA and ISS 
(Immigration Social Services.)  The YMCA program is free and is offered on a first come/first served basis.  ISS is available to all 
families and offers homework help by a certified teacher, which is available at a very affordable price.  Many of the teachers 
and counselors in both programs speak Chinese, the predominate first language at our school.  All forms and invitations that 
are sent home are offered in English, Spanish, and Chinese.  Students are not discriminated on ELL status when being 
considered for school programs. 
Title III funding is used to offer a variety program to all ELLs and former ELLs at our school; chess is offered to all students in 
grades 1-5, a music program taught by a certified ESL teacher is available to ELLs in grades 3-5 and three certified ENL teachers 
provide afterschool activities such as cross-country running, Miniprenuers, and an intro to Movie Making.  
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All of the ELL subgroups, SIFE, ELL-SWD, newcomers, ELLs with 4-6 years in the ENL program, long term ELLs, and former ELLs, 
utilize a variety of resources and materials.  Leveled guided reading sets of books are offered at all Fountas and Pinnell levels. 
The ENL teachers have their own sets that are kept in their rooms.  There are also many books in both Spanish and Chinese. 
For the younger students games, puzzles, art projects, and manipulatives are offered to reinforce the language they are 
learning.  The 3 certified ENL teachers use document cameras, projectors, DVDs, as well as online websites geared specifically 
for ELLs in the ENL classroom.  The ENL teachers use iPads, laptops, and computers to incorporate technology into their 
lessons.  Many books on tape and cd are available to the students to take home.  Our certified ENL teachers have successfully 
acquired many supplies and equipment from generous donations through Donors Choose.  The teachers write their classroom 
project requests and post on the Donors Choose website.  Donors then donate to certain teachers’ projects.  The ENL team has 
received an iPad, extra large white board easel, kidney shaped table, a laminating machine, a rug with a map of the United 
States on it, reams of paper, colored paper, art supplies, mobile organizers, and so much more all from their Donors Choose 
projects!  Class created bilingual or multilingual materials are created to support English language acquisition.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home Languages are supported, recognized and celebrated by the ENL program.  Students are encouraged to share their 
knowledge of their home language both verbally and in writing when producing work.  Students work with each other to 
support their language needs.   At PS 126/MAT we strive to celebrate the native languages and cultures of our student 
population.  Students and families are invited to the annual Dragon Dance performed at the school for the Lunar New Year 
celebration.  ELLs and their families are afforded equal access to all school programs and are invited to all school wide 
functions. All official school notices are sent home in Chinese and Spanish in addition to English and all students are given the 
option to participate in after school activities without bias.  Many books at all reading levels are available in Chinese and 
Spanish. Because our school is located in Chinatown, near Chatham Square where there is the Kim Lau Memorial Arch 
dedicated to the Chinese who died in World War II, many field trips are taken to local Chinese attractions including Confucius 
Plaza, the Mahayana Buddhist Temple, the largest Buddhist temple in Chinatown, Mosco Street to Mott Street, the oldest 
Chinese inhabited street in New York City, the famous Doyers Street with a 90 degree turn so straight-flying ghosts can’t move 
through it, and MOCA (Museum of Chinese in America.) 
  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required services support ELLs and resources correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade level.  In Kindergarten through grade 5, 
the certified ENL teachers work collaboratively with classroom teachers and other staff to teach challenging academic content 
to prepare students for middle school and beyond.  Using each grade’s pacing calendar as a guide, they work with small groups 
both inside and outside the classroom to provide targeted instruction and support based on individual student needs, ages, 
and grade levels.  Students actively participate in hands-on language rich activities in the classroom that promote academic 
language development and creativity. 
At the secondary level, grades 6-8, the certified ENL teacher teaches the English necessary to demonstrate complex thinking 
and learning.  Through engaging and challenging interactions with teachers and peers, students acquire the English language 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

proficiency skills and content knowledge needed to be ready for high school and college.  ENL teachers carefully choose, plan, 
and adapt activities and topics to be covered throughout the year along with each grade’s Pacing Calendar.  Teachers provide 
student instruction in the process of choosing an appropriate text and the students and teacher work together to choose 
appropriate writing topics in the persuasive, narrative, and comparing/contrasting genres. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
All of the ELL subgroups, SIFE, ELL-SWD, newcomers, ELLs with 4-6 years in the ENL program, long term ELLs, and former ELLs, 
utilize a variety of resources and materials.  Leveled guided reading sets of books are offered at all Fountas and Pinnell levels. 
The ENL teachers have their own sets that are kept in their rooms.  There are also many books in both Spanish and Chinese. 
For the younger students games, puzzles, art projects, and manipulatives are offered to reinforce the language they are 
learning.  The 3 certified ENL teachers use document cameras, projectors, dvds, as well as online websites geared specifically 
for ELLs in the ENL classroom.  The ENL teachers use iPads, laptops, and computers to incorporate technology into their 
lessons.  Many books on tape and cd are available to the students to take home.  Our certified ENL teachers have successfully 
acquired many supplies and equipment from generous donations through Donors Choose.  The teachers write their classroom 
project requests and post on the Donors Choose website.  Donors then donate to certain teachers’ projects.  The ENL team has 
received an iPad, extra large white board easel, kidney shaped table, a laminating machine, a rug with a map of the United 
States on it, reams of paper, colored paper, art supplies, mobile organizers, and so much more all from their Donors Choose 
projects!  Class created bilingual or multilingual materials are created to support English language acquisition.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
During the summer, new students can enroll in one of the summer camps offered at our school through the local YMCA and 
ISS (Immigration Social Services.) The camps have bilingual counselors who can speak the students’ first language.  The 
children get an opportunity to interact with other children who speak their language and learn English from these experiences, 
as well as meet their future classmates.  Throughout the school year, ELLs can join the various Tittle III afterschool programs 
the school offers.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish is a language elective that is offered to ELLs in 7th and 8th grades. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
  The Professional Development Plan includes the 3 certified ENL teachers attending various workshops and professional 
development opportunities offered by OELL throughout the year.  There is a weekly ENL team meeting during the week where 
we discuss goals, opportunities, materials, ideas, planning, and any other ESL issues that arise.  There are also funds allotted 
for Professional Development through Title III that includes classroom teachers attending the same workshops as the ENL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

teachers. Our plan includes attending CUNY NYSIEB cohort 4 professional development which focuses on translanguaging and 
using students’ home language as a resource for learning English a first grade, third grade and sixth grade teacher are also a 
part of this program.  We attended 2 in person professional developments this fall, have 2 webinars this winter and one more 
in person session in the Spring.  The future dates are still TBD.   
ESL professional development opportunities that support ELLs in regard to the Common Core Learning Standards are offered 
through OELL throughout the year.  The Title III funded professional development is also used to learn about supporting ELLs as 
they engage in CCLS. The school has several literacy consultants who come to the school to give workshops with all the 
teachers, including the ENL teachers. November 23rd a team of CUNY NYSIEB representatives will be providing a PD for the 
entire staff and provide the staff with ideas on how to improve the schools multilingual ecology and using bilingualism as a 
resource in the classroom.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Since we have a middle school in the same building as our elementary school, almost all of our 5th grade ELLs are accepted to 
our middle school.  The certified ENL teacher meets with the 6th grade teachers to discuss the students, their needs, and any 
other concerns or questions she may have about the incoming ELLs.  The certified middle school ENL teacher also offers way 
she can support the students in their middle school classes.  The ENL teacher and the school counselor discuss high schools 
with 8th grade former  ELLs.  Guidance counselors also help with the transition and go to periodic professional developments 
throughout the year. 
Some classroom teachers are included in the Title III professional development sessions which provide ELL training.  Some of 
the classroom teachers attended a professional development with the CUNY NYSIEB (New York State Initiative on Emergent 
Bilinguals) team.  All staff participates in ongoing professional development sessions on Universal Design for Learning 
(UDL.)  UDL is a set of principles for curriculum development that give all individuals equal opportunities to learn. These 
principles align perfectly with the principles of teaching English as a second language.  UDL provides a framework for 
understanding how to create curricula that meets the needs of all learners from the start and places the burden of adaptation 
on curricula, not the learner.  All teachers, counselors, and staff participate in these UDL workshops that emphasize the 
importance of eliminating unnecessary barriers without eliminating the necessary challenges. There is ongoing professional 
development throughout the year that is offered by various staff developers in Reading, Writing, Math and Social Studies.     
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL department holds an orientation for Newcomers at the start of the year to discuss parent choice options for the three 
programs the city offers ELLs.  With kindergarten, parents are met with a member of the ENL team before or after they come 
in for their orientation with their home room teacher.  Other meetings with parents are as needed and at a time when an 
interpreter is available.   Records of these meetings are via parent sign-in sheets. Goals of the ENL program are also stated at 
the parent orientation.  One on one meetings are also held during registration of new students with the assistance of an 
interpreter.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
ENL teachers frequently participate in grade level field trips that all parents are invited to join.  ELL parents often chaperon on 
these trips.  As part of one of our Title III programs, parents are invited on the Explorers’ field trips around the city of New 
York.  These parents have accompanied us to museums, an amusement park, and ice skating, just to name a few.  Parents of 
ELLs are also invited to any class performance or special day hosted by the ENL teacher or classroom teacher.  Parents 
attended one our ENL teacher’s performance of “The Grouchy Ladybug” starring only newcomer ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Carlos Romero, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The school’s written translation and oral interpretation needs are determined through ATS, emergency cards as 
well as Home Language Identification Survey. During enrollment, one of the school’s aides, along with a 
pedagogue, will assist and guide parents in completing all the necessary documents. Similarly, if a child is 
transferring from a different school, the office staff will look through the student’s cumulative folder to ensure all 
documentation are present. In addition, most of our school’s aides are bilingual speakers who can provide 
assistance in written translation and oral interpretation for non-English speaking parents.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.

identified to support the language needs of our families.

Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

By using the resources in the Language Access Kit we will place a Welcome Poster at the main entrance of the school. 
The Language ID Guide will be placed at the security desk and main office. Additionally, copies of the Parents' Bill of 
Rights and Parents' Guide to Language Access will be sent home with all students.
