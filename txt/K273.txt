Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our mission here at PS 273 is to develop high achieving, critical thinkers in a safe, risk free environment. We see our 
school as a community where all members, students, staff and parents create an atmosphere where learning, 
creativity and participation take place. Ideally all members will work cooperatively utilizing all resources (libraries, 
museums, community based organizations, etc.) in and out of the community in order to enable our students to 
become lifelong learners and active participants in our school and our society. The student will develop decision 
making skills, critical thinking skills and the ability to communicate effectively.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Public School 273 is located in the East New York section of Brooklyn, New York. This Pre-Kindergarten to fifth grade 
(PK-5) school serves a population of approximately 370 students from diverse backgrounds. The school is a central 
part of the community to many of the students and their families. The school building is a well-kept, traditional 
building where pride in the students' accomplishments are evident in the prominently displayed student work. PS 273 
offers After-School opportunities, Reading Plus, MobyMax, and support from other CBO's to enhance our targeted 
goals.  

 

The school houses two full day Pre-Kindergarten classes, two full day Kindergarten classes, two first grade, two 
second grade, two third grade, two fourth grade, and two fifth grade classes in general education, two collaborative 
team teaching (ICT) classes (serving grades kindergarten and one ), and three self-contained special education classes 
(12:1:1; serving grades K-2, 2-3, and 3-5). There is also a freestanding ESL program for grades K-5, which serves English 
Language Learners. The average class size in kindergarten through third grade, following the Early Grade Class Size 
Reduction Program, is twenty one (21) students. The average class size in fourth and fifth grades is twenty-five (25) 
students. Students are heterogeneously grouped within each grade. Current strategies for implementing the Common 
Core Learning Standards include using differentiated instruction and developing programs to increase movement to 
less restrictive environments for Students With Disabilities (SWD).  

 

PS 273 will take a continuous improvement, data-driven approach to improving student performance, through 
Northwest Evaluation Association's interim assessments in ELA & Mathematics. We will continue to use item analysis, 
portfolio assessments, and other indicators to identify and address student weakness and target areas for growth. 
Ongoing assessments will be both formal and informal. Assessments will essentially be used to drive instruction.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

PS 273 offers two collaborative team teaching (ICT) classes serving grades kindergarten and one, and three self-
contained special education classes (12:1:1; serving grades K-2, 2-3, and 3-5). There is also a freestanding ENL 
program for grades K-5, which serves English Language Learners. Their specific needs are, speech, occupational and 
physical therapies, academic support and counseling.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The following two elements are where we made the most progress this year: 

1. Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 

2. Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 

Our key focus for the upcoming school year is to improve the rigor of instructional practices throughout our school.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
A review of accountability data indicates that the percentage of students scoring at Levels 3 & 4 in ELA decreased 
from 26% in 2017 to 24% in 2018.  

Classrooms are generally strong in the following Danielson components: 

2a: Creating an environment of respect and support 

2d: Managing student behavior 

Higher order questioning and high levels of student engagement are present in some classrooms, and teachers' 
content area knowledge is generally strong.  

A review of Quality Review/PPO results and Advance data indicate that establishing a schoolwide common 
understanding of instructional best practices remains an area for continued development. 

Quality Review (Page 5): Build capacity for faculty to collaborate with school leaders and develop rigorous instruction 
to accelerate student achievement. Strengthen the inquiry approach to teacher collaboration and encourage 
teachers' participation in decision making.  

Our priority need for Rigorous Instruction will be to accelerate student achievement through providing teachers with 
the coaching and support necessary to improve their pedagogy and increase levels of student engagement. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, through the use of Marzano’s Classroom Instruction that Works, all teachers will increase their expertise 
in the Danielson high-yield strategies:

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
According to our School Quality Snapshot (2017-2018), 73% of respondents replied positively to questions about 
supportive environment. In the NYC School Survey (2017-2018) 97% of families say their child feels safe and 
supported at PS 273. 

Although, students feel safe and supported, the percentage of chronically absent (45.4%) and late students is still an 
issue. There is a need for us to support our families through various measures 

Some practices that are in place and will continue to be expanded on are: 

Student of the Month celebrations 

  Reading celebrations 
  Attendance celebrations 
 
  Principal’s secret room 
  Wise Wildcats 
  Targeted small group intervention 
  Arts/STEM/Test Prep afterschool 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, we will reduce the percentage of chronically absent students by 6% (45.4% to 39.4%) through a tiered 
system for identifying and supporting students at risk for chronic absenteeism.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

A review of accountability data indicates that the percentage of students scoring at Levels 3 & 4 in Math decreased 
from 17% in 2017 to 15% in 2018.  

The principal nurtures professional growth of teachers by training them to facilitate professional development of 
fellow staff members based on the trends identified through data such as NWEA, surveys, teacher feedback, 
Danielson, etc. 

We want our staff to become master teachers and to feel empowered to take on leadership roles and become true 
stakeholders in the school community. 

Ensuring that the distributive structures are in place to allow teachers to grow as leaders and improve Math 
instruction throughout the school is a priority need this school year. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, we will implement shared leadership structures consisting of small learning teams and teacher leaders 
serving as the conduit for shared communication, improved teacher practice, and improved student achievement as 
measured by an increase in Math PI from 59.9 to 76.2.

Measuring student learning allows educators to better understand their students’ strengths and how best to support 
student growth. By collaboratively making thoughtful MOSL selections, schools can measure student growth in 
meaningful ways that reinforce their instructional priorities.  

A MOSL team is assembled and meets to select appropriate multiple assessments that each grade and cluster will be 
held accountable. Professional development involves the following in terms of MOSL implementation: 

Looking at student work and assessment results in vertical and horizontal teacher teams  

 
  Using norming exercises to plan instruction across grades or subjects  
  Using benchmark and formative assessments to regularly check-in throughout the year to assess student 

progress 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 273, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 273will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At PS 273 we use the Fountas and Pinnell Running Record for monitoring progress at the beginning, middle and end of 
year.  The insights that is provided from the data allows us to use the student's instructional and independent levels to provide 
ELL services. The data also evaluates a students reading and comprehension ability to determine a student's guided reading 
level to group students accordingly. The assessments also allow us to observe the processing strategies and problem solving 
actions a student has. It is useful in gathering information about the literacy skills of ELL students when planning instruction 
and creating groups for reading instruction. The benchmark levels in the assessment also help make good decisions regarding 
student's movement for small group instruction. The insights provided by the data allow the ESL teacher to design the 
curriculum and to choose the tools that would be appropriate for the current academic level that the student attains on the 
assessment. The assessments show that the ELL students are reading below grade level. The struggles of the students are not

solely based on language acquisition. Also with the possibility of the DIBELS being implemented in the Fall as an additional 
assessment to track students and to further target student's weakness, it will allow us identify what literacy skills can be 
reinforced and worked on in small groups and with RTI to promote student progress. Overall, assessments allow you to track 
progress over time, analyze trends in reading performance, and compare data within your class in order to inform your 
instructional plan.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 DIBELS being implemented in the Fall as an additional assessment to track students and to further target student's weakness, 
it will allow us identify what literacy skills can be reinforced and worked on in small groups and with RTI to promote student 
progress. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of the ELL program at the school is evaluated by the students meeting the set goals and standards for the year. 
The students are considered successful when they are able to have full conversation in English and meet the Listening, 
Speaking, Viewing Standards for ELA. Students progress in assessments and benchmark assignments also demonstrate the 
success of Ells in the program.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  
Reinforcement in small group assignments to AIS staff along with additional RTI to promote student progress. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Once the ELL learning profile has been established using assessments, observations and collected data, specific issues are 
targeted for intervention. An effective and comprehensive approach to promote ELL's academic achievement will include 
targeted supplemental interventions offered to those who need more support. Students who are performing below grade 
level will be placed in Tier II after initial assessments. Beginners and Intermediate ELL students will receive intervention 2-3x's 
a week for 30 minutes per session and advance students will receive 1-2x's a week for 30 minutes per session. This support is 
provided in smaller group instruction and one to one learning. Our Literacy Coach will also provides additional support for ELL 
students in addition to what is received in the classroom and ESL program.  Kindergarten ELLs struggling with early literacy skill 
development receives assistance with further development of phonics strategies. Progress will be monitored over time to 
ensure that instruction continues to be adjusted to meet the needs of each individual ELL learner. The students will also 
receive small group instruction for additional support in the classroom.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
At this time, the data patterns that appear across performance levels are that the students are scoring the least on the writing 
section of the four domains on the NYSESLAT.   Most of the ELL students need additional support with reading and writing. The 
majority of the students achieved lower scores on the Reading and Writing section of the LAB-R and the NYSESLAT than in 
speaking and listening. The reading domain has shown progression and regression over time. The writing domain within the 
NYSESLAT is impacting the overall raw score with students with disabilities (SWD). The struggles of the students are not solely 
based on language acquisition.     
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Ongoing process monitoring every 3 weeks.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

        Students in the freestanding ENL program will received standalone ENL and or/ intergrated ENL according to their 
ENL proficiency levels determined from the NYSELAT. ELL students will not be served in classes of more than 2 
contiguous grades. Former ELLs will receive service for 2 years after reaching proficient/commanding level.  
  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here:    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

              Beginner/Entering: Students will receive 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA 
Low intermediate/ Emerging: Students will receive 90 minutes of standalone ENL, 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL ( 
with ELA or other content area)depending on students needs and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA 
Intermediate/ Transitioning: Students will receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of 90 minutes of 
standalone or integrated ENL (with ELA or any other content area) depending on students needs. 
Advanced/Expanding: Students will receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area 
Proficient/Commanding: Students will receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
       Students who arrive with home language literacy skills receive academic support as they transfer knowledge directly as 
they are learning to read and write in English. Content area instruction is carefully planned and scaffold, vocabulary is 
emphasized, language objectives are identified, materials used are well thought out, lessons should be adapted to reach 
differences learning styles, proficiency levels and abilities for newcomers. Tne newcomers backgrounds must also be 
considered. The teachers in collaboration with administration, coaches and other staff work to design the best educational 
experiences possible for these students.ESL teaching meteorologists are shared and incorporated as ELLs are engaged in 
writing across genres on a variety of fictional and non-fictional topics as strategies differ based upon the difficulty of the 
language encountered and the amount of emphasis needed in a particular content area. They learn how and why writers 
write, the structures of different genres and author’s craft. Content Area vocabulary is emphasized as ELLs learn new words 
encountered in subject areas. Teachers demonstrate the act of writing by engaging in Think Alouds to help Ells understand the 
connection between thinking and writing. Grade and age appropriate vocabulary is developed, as well as phonemic awareness, 
phonics. Students are also provided with content instruction while incorporating ESL methodology and techniques including 
the use of visuals, modified text, TPR, graphic organizers, and scaffolding. Native language supports are also available if 
needed.  
  
The instructional practices for ELLs in the early stages include language modeling, visual aides and context clues to obtain and 
convey meaning with the focus on comprehension. As development continues, the uses of video tapes, cassettes, and 
earphones are concrete, helpful tools for learning English. Hands-on activities, computers, dialogues, motivational 
conversations, chants, arts, literature and multicultural activities are all necessary and useful practices that enable ELL 
students to acquire and develop English language skills. With the demands of the Common Core Learning standards, the ESL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

curriculum reflects these changes while working towards the 6 instructional shifts. Instructional practices will include modeling 
how to respond using text-based answers, writing from sources, using academic vocabulary, and  increasing the use of text 
complexity. Students must be instructed to use the evidence they collect from what they read in order to form cogent and 
convincing opinions and arguments in the writing they produce. Students must also begin to think and argue through texts by 
constantly being asked to find evidence in what they have read.There is also an increase in the use of non-fiction, writing in 
response to reading,  and expository writing.  Last, instruction will develop students ability to use and access words that are 
showing up in everyday vocabulary, but are slightly out of reach for our students, thus utilizing context clues and the 
contextual understanding of words and domain specific terminology.      
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

       The Spanish LAB-R is administered to students who speak Spanish at home and score below proficiency to determine 
language dominance. Whenever possible, native language proficiency in content areas is used during literacy instruction in 
order to build English proficiency. Pre-reading skills are developed as scaffolding is incorporated in lessons. The use of graphic 
organizers help to structure information as students try to relate prior knowledge to material being taught. Schema is 
activated as visuals, technology, audio aides, reader's theater, and discussions help. The ESL teacher and testing coordinator 
also work together to ensure that students receive appropriate testing modifications such as the use of a bilingual glossary 
when applicable.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

  a. In the event that we will have SIFE students we plan to provide support with the mandate ESL instruction as per CR 154 
 regulations.  by offering an environment that meets the social, cultural and linguistic needs of these students. Trained staff 
will use 
 instructional methods designed to meet their individual needs. Sheltered instruction that modifies English language 
instruction 
 can help make the subject matter more comprehensible to students with limited vocabulary. Learning will be differentiated  
through sheltered instruction that  includes visuals, collaborative learning activities, audio aides, and demonstrations. 
Standards 
 can be adapted so that explicit teaching of the most critical content area vocabulary and information is presented in a way  
that can be most effective and age-appropriate.   
b. Newcomers (ELLs in US schools for less than three years) will be provided with ESL services based on CR 154 regulations. 
They 
 are welcomed as teachers, specialists, and others become familiar with their linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Basic facts  
are learned about the students and their families. Information is gathered by assigned staff concerning the students prior 
 experiences student's home/native language is accessed. It has been proved feasible to start with ESL and classroom thematic 
 units on themes such as: All About Me, Where We Were Born, Family Orgins" and other units of this type. Our Administration 
is 
 very involved in all aspects of the newcomers successful adjustment and welcome to our school as they reach out to the 
families 
 and students. Tours are given, key personnel are pointed out. Our Parent Coordinator, Mrs. Karmo ensures that notices, 
letters, etc 
 are offered in preferred languages. Newcomers are paired with a friend or buddy to help them learn and feel comfortable in 
 their new environment. A variety of formats are put in place to meet the multiple of needs the newcomers and their families. 
As 
 we begin to know more about the students teachers and staff are better able to offer social and academic support as 
programs  
are differentiated to meet their individual needs.

c.ELLS receiving services for 4-6 years will continue with their mandated ESL services. They will aslo be given extra support in 
 areas of weaknesses noted as a result of their ELA, Math, Content Area, NYSESLAT/ LAB-R Formal Assessments and Informal 
 Assessments. Data is collected from these resources as instruction is designed to address and remediate these deficiencies.  
Students are provided with work, which is contextually relevant and reflects the urban experience. Students and staff are  
trained to access technological resources to facilitate the writing/learning processes. Teachers strive to structure assignments  
to tap higher order thinking skills. All staff is assisted in understanding the lingering problems in negotiating a new 
 language. Students, parents and teachers are encouraged to develop activities, which reflect the rich diversity of our school 
 community. ELL services will be provided by the ESL teacher. The instructional strategy will enable our students to listen 
d. Long term ELLs receiving 6 or more years of services will continue with mandated ESL services with additional RTI support 
within 
 ESL instruction and in the classroom. These students will be given Academic Intervention Services, as appropriate, in the areas 
of  
weaknesses noted as a result of their ELA, Math, Content Area, NYSESLAT and informal assessments. If a child continues to 
struggle 
 despite the further intervention provided, a formal evaluation for additional services may be needed.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 The ELL instructional practices in the early stages of English language acquisition include language modeling, visual aides and 
context clues to obtain and convey meaning. At this point, the focus is on comprehension. As development continues, the use 
of videotapes, cassettes and earphones are concrete, helpful tools for learning English. Hands-on activities, computers, 
dialogues, motivational conversations, chants, arts, literature and multicultural activities are all necessary and useful practices 
that enable ELL students to acquire and develop English language skills. All students are involved in supplemental programs 
and extracurricular activities offered by the school. The instructional and intervention programs in PS 273 that support our 
Special Needs ELL students are: 
• A Comprehensive Approach to Balanced Literacy 
• Differentiated Instructional Strategies for all curriculum 
• Research-based Mathematics program 
• Academic Intervention Services 
• School Assessment Team (SAT) 
• Guidance Counselor 
• Mandated Guidance Counselor 
• Special Needs Speech Services 
• Paraprofessionals in the 12:1:1 classes 
• Integrated Co-Teaching Class (ICT)for grades K-4 
• Open Court Phonics Program Grades K-3 
• Reading Plus  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The ESL scheduled block time was created with a team to ensure that students receive their ESL mandates in addition to their 
IEP mandated related services. The Special Education Teacher works closely and networks regularly with the Teacher of ESL 
when addressing the needs of students being serviced per IEP mandates. ESL strategies and lessons are tailored for the 
classroom teacher using ESL support materials. Content area vocabulary is introduced via diagrams, picture representations, 
vocabulary games, flash cards and other audio and visual means. Informal assessments are ongoing as progress is monitored. 
The teacher is encouraged to offer frequent positive reinforcement in all subject areas, as warranted. More time is given to the 
student to complete assignments, as needed. Hard copies, as well as, on-line and audio bilingual glossaries and dictionaries 
offer differing approaches to assisting the student in the classroom setting with vocabulary, parts of speech, pronunciation, 
etc. Materials and lessons are differentiated and broken down in very small steps until evidence of comprehension is reached. 
The ESL teacher and the Special Education teacher address IEP goals while designing lessons best suited for the student. 
Cultural factors are considered along with the individual learning needs and styles of the students.

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Programs/services are open to ELLs and others on an equal basis according to individual needs. Programs are school-wide. 
Former ELLS all receive invitation to participate. Services and resources correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels.   The Science 
Teacher, Ms. Ford provides support in preparation for NYS Science Exam along with testing accommodations when 
administered to 4th grade ESL students. Students can also be provided with Academic Intervention Services and RTI.  ELl 
students also attend the after school program provided for test prep in ELA and Math 2x a week. Students also attend lunch 
and learn program provided by selected teachers in their classroom to provided additional intervention.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

This upcoming school year the new programs being implemented are Go Math and ReadyGen. The school is also using the 
Reading Plus program that will be used to target 100 students who are performing below in their reading fluency, 
comprehension, and recalling of information in a text.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

  As of date there are no programs/services slated for ELLs that will be eliminated of discontinued.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 ELLs are invited through the use of back-packed letters, telephone system or mailings. Letters are sent hom in student's native 
language. Parents are encourage to participate in school programs and are provided with information to participate in PTA 
meetings, book clubs, and the Parent Cook shop program. Parents are also welcomed to suggest programs they would like and 
the Parent Coordinator will assist with helping them when applicable. Afterschool Programs are open to all students in grades 
3-5 which focuses on Test Prep and strategies in Reading and Math. This will help students develop strategies for test 
preparation. In the Spring after school programs for 1-2 provided additional reading and math instruction when available.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Students participate in computer generated programs such as, "Starfall" and "Nessy" reading and writing programs. The 
practices for ELLs in the early stages include language modeling, visual aides and context clues to obtain and convey meaning 
with the focus on comprehension. As development continues, the uses of video tapes, cassettes, and earphones are concrete, 
helpful tools for learning English. Hands-on activities, computers, dialogues, motivational conversations, chants, arts, literature 
and multicultural activities are all necessary and useful practices that enable ELL students to acquire and develop English 
language skills.  Students also participate in ST math with the math cluster teacher which incorporates technology into the 
math content. Wowzers is an additional program we have also began using which is visual and uses repetition for math 
concepts. Brainpop ESL is also used to help support ELLs. Videos are also used as a supplement to enhance comprehension of 
math concepts.        
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 Native language support is offered through use of bi-lingual glossaries and dictionaries, leveled libraries, books in native 
languages, audio and visual aides to help support content areas, teaching content embedded vocabulary using native 
languages as support, games, dramatization, parental input and involvement in lessons and activities. Technogology is 
incorporated in activities, writing assignments, study of grammar and usage and English language practice of reading passages 
and skills.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 The ESL teacher strives to ensure that required services for ELLs do support their learning at all ages and grade levels. The ESL 
teacher collaborates with the classroom teachers to promote the academic success of all ELL students. The teachers 
communicate the needs of their students, and the ESL teacher makes sure that the proper resources are available at all ages 
and grade levels                

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Students participate in computer generated programs such as, "Starfall" and "Nessy" reading and writing programs. The 
practices for ELLs in the early stages include language modeling, visual aides and context clues to obtain and convey meaning 
with the focus on comprehension. As development continues, the uses of video tapes, cassettes, and earphones are concrete, 
helpful tools for learning English. Hands-on activities, computers, dialogues, motivational conversations, chants, arts, literature 
and multicultural activities are all necessary and useful practices that enable ELL students to acquire and develop English 
language skills.  Students also participate in ST math with the math cluster teacher which incorporates technology into the 
math content. Wowzers is an additional program we have also began using which is visual and uses repitition for math 
concepts. Brainpop ESL is also used to help support ELLs. Videos are also used as a supplement to enhance comprehension of 
math concepts.        
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
   Before the start of the school term, in many cases, ELLs visit at time of enrollment. Our Prinicpal, Ms. Avery welcomes the 
children and their families. The Parent Coordinator reaches out to the parents to help secure information, answer questions, 
and further assist. Translators are on hand if possible, if not, contacts are made. There are onsite translators for the languages 
in the school. Further assistance is needed administration reaches out to the network.The parents and children are taken on a 
tour of the school to help with adjustment to the new environment. Packets or brochures are handed out, such as, "What your 
child needs to learn…" Literature is offered in language of choice. They are introduced to key staff and shown the basic layout 
out the school. Newcomers are made to feel completely welcome as they look forward to joining our school family. Literature, 
calendars, school newsletters, posters pertaining to upcoming workshop, community activities, etc are always available at 
front entrance of school building. Bulletin boards are always kept up to date. Translators and interpretators are on hand 
throughout the day. If not available, all avenues are explored to secure help with home languages not readily available for 
translation. Support is offered from selected School Support Organizations (SSOs), localized Integrated Service Centers (ISC) 
and the Translation and Interpretation Unit. When necessary follow ups are made in person or by phone until parents have the 
information required or requested.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Melessa Avery, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The school uses the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) to identify the primary language of parents. In 
addition to completing the HLIS with the help of trained staff member, an oral interview is conducted. The 
information is recorded, maintained and reviewed by both the Pupil Accounting Secretary and the ESL 
teacher.The data and methodologies used to assess the school's parents who are non-English speaking were done 
through a survey developed by the School Leadership Team and the PTA. Information about parent's language 
preference is also filled out on the HLIS forms and documented. Information from the Learning Enviornment 
Survey also serves as data to implement change. Meetings are held with the ESL teacher to address direct 
concerns of parents.

The School Leadership 
Team reviewed the survey 
and found that there was 
a need for translation of 
various docouments and 
information packets 
within the school. Parents 
have requested that a 
team of staff members be 
organized to address the 
needs of all parents who 
are non-English speaking. 
The information was 
dissseminated during the 
School Leadership Team 
meetings. Information is 
also disseminated to 
parents via school letters 
that are backpacked. The 
language indicated by 
parents whos preferred 
language is other than 
English was Spanish.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.
