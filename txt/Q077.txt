Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our Mission: The school’s mission is for all students to realize their potential and become lifelong learners who 
assume leadership roles in their communities and in their futures. Our school strives to provide an academically 
rigorous program within a safe, nurturing learning community that cultivates the diverse needs, interests and skills of 
the individual. We believe that we can achieve this mission only with the cooperation of the parents/families, 
students, staff, and community partners. 
  

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Intermediate School 77, located in Ridgewood, Queens, was formerly designated as an America’s Choice Model 
School, an honor bestowed upon only ten middle schools throughout the United States. This sixth to eighth grade 
school serves a population of approximately 1,093 students. The majority of the students are Hispanic (74%), while 
the remainder of the student body is Asian (5%) and Caucasian (5%). Our English Language Learners comprise 20% of 
our school population. 

The motto of IS 77, “A Family of Learners,” illustrates the commitment of the faculty and staff to pursue ongoing 
professional development in order to provide the most current research-based instruction available.  

The faculty and staff have participated in a number of initiatives such as Quality Teaching for English Language 
Learners (Q-TEL), Expediting Comprehension for English Language Learners (ExC-ELL), Kate Kinsella’s Academic 
Vocabulary Toolkit (AVT), and Collaborative Strategic Reading (CSR). These initiatives have enabled the staff to 
incorporate best practices in teaching for our sizeable population of English Language Learners. Since many of our 
students reside in homes where English is a second language, these practices have become invaluable tools for 
teaching all students.  

Our parent coordinator holds monthly lunch and learn workshops for parents in English, as well as in Spanish. Some 
topics include Cyber-bulling, Understanding the Common Core Learning Standards, and other topics addressing the 
academic, emotional and social well-being of our students. 

IS 77 recognizes that in order to meet the diverse needs of the students and families of this community, the role of 
the school should expand beyond traditional teaching and learning. In addition, our school has maintained an ongoing 
relationship with P.S. 239, one of our feeder schools. Our sixth graders visit first grade classes at P.S 239 to teach the 
younger students reading strategies. These young mentors benefit by serving as role models to the younger students, 
as well as sharpening their own skills in reading. 

IS 77 currently benefits from various community partnerships including those with Greater Ridgewood Youth Council, 
Assemblyman Mike Miller (Student of the Month), Department of Transportation (student/community project), 
Kiwanis Club of Glendale (Builders Club and Support Peer Mediation), and CHAMPS. Our partnership with Greater 
Ridgewood Youth Council provides homework help, sports (IS 77’s first basketball team), and a STEM program. STEM 
is a national initiative to increase student future pathways towards industries involving science, technology, 
engineering and mathematics. 

IS 77 was recently awarded an Arts Horizon Grant. Arts Horizons recognizes the transformative power of the arts and 
is dedicated to providing high quality programs for learning of all ages and abilities. Their programs for Literacy 
Development are led by professional teaching artists who engage students in hands on workshops that stimulate 
creativity, vocabulary development, speaking and communication skills. Through these programs, our ELL and SWD

School wide initiatives that promote literacy, including the Book of the Month, the Book Campaign, and non-fiction 
reading and writing across the content areas are established. Future Leaders of America at IS 77, a leadership 
program for our 8th grade students was created. This program includes a bulletin board team, a clean team, and a big 
brothers/big sisters program while also enhancing leadership skills. A variety of after-school clubs are offered to 
address student interest and academic need. Some of these include a book club, SHSAT Prep, Math help, and a music 
club. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

IS 77 has a large number (approximately 25 % of the student body are ENL and 25% are students SWD. Both of these 
populations have not met AYP in ELA, and the ENL students did not meet AYP in Math. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

We are working on Rigorous Instruction . We are analyzing and strengthening the Instruction Core as per the work of 
Advanced Literacy with Nonie Lesaux. Two key shifts that we will continue to work on: 1) The Instructional Core. We 
will look at the use of school wide protocols to support reading, writing, speaking, and listening. 2) Placing data at the 
core of the literacy improvement effort. We need to look at data to see what is wrong and WHY it is wrong.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans  

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 3 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
3.2 

The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of 
rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students. 
Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction 
(DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and 
address student achievement needs. 
The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner 
within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the 
arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities. 
Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative 
assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student 
reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

7th grade ESL Students will learn on average 5 academic vocabulary words per week, reinforced in the 4 major content 
subjects. Each subject will be mandated a particular day of the week to teach the target words. The words will appear 
on word walls in the class rooms as well as student s' source books. IS 77 has adopted the Word Gen program from 
MSQI. This is a structured program to teach high impact vocabulary words across the grades and content. This aligns 
with our shift to strengthen the instructional core. Part of this shift is to study a small set of high-utility vocabulary 
words needed to master language and content.Supervisors will also see the lesson taught as per the schedule and this 
will be documented in Advance for informal and formal observations. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.

By June 2019, all students with a focus on SWDs and ELLs will participate in specialized Word Gen, HD Word, and Great 
Books programs for ELA, and ST Math for mathematics to improve the rigor of instruction as measured by an increase in 
scores on the NYS Standardized Test for ELA and Math and an increase in DRP scores.

According to the School Quality Snapshot, IS 77 has a 94% student daily attendance this year. From the same survey, 
91% of students feel that IS 77 offers a wide variety of programs, classes and activities to keep students interested in 
school. Along with our CBO, the Greater Ridgewood Youth Council, IS 77 has a very comprehensive after school, SONYC 
and ELT program. Based on sign in sheets for last school year, about 200 students attended programs each day after 
school. There are still about 19% of our students that are chronically absent. This needs to be reduced.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           41 

 

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. IS 77, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student 
Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the 
connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed 
to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of 
their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and 
Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

IS 77 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement 
level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning 
and decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support 
and monitor their child’s progress; 
● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, 
and in languages that parents can understand; 
● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to 
improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between 
parents and other members of the school community;

The school’s Parent Involvement  

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of 
the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School 
Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their 
members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 
implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 
● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are 
allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting 
skills; 
● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 
strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, 
the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes 
providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership 
skills;  
● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, 
Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 
parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their 
right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 
1118 and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of 
the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations 
and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

The majority of the ELL students tested on the expanding level  in terms of the five 
modalities.  Ten percent (10%) of students scored at the entering level, with 17% scoring at the 
emerging level, with 29% scoring at the transitional level, with 46% scoring on the expanding 
level, and with 8% scoring on the commanding level.  With the majority of students falling into 
the expanding level, we offer support in all four modalities.  These scores allow us to see that 
students tend to struggle with the reading/writing portion of these exams.  In terms of 
implications for classroom instruction, it is imperative that there be more opportunities for 
building academic language, explicit reading instruction, grammar in the Writer's Workshop, and 
writing skills through word study activities and daily tasks involving the application of 
vocabulary into higher order thinking responses. Balanced literacy within the workshop model 
provides the structure and grouping to facilitate instruction and practice in a small-group 
setting.I.S. 77 conducts a supplemental Title III Program for English Language Learners in the 
morning and once a month on Saturdays.  It is offered and opened to ELLs of all proficiency 
levels in sixth, seventh, and eighth grade.   The direct instruction supplemental program will 
target all proficiency levels in grades 6 through 8.  The Morning Program will run two days a 
week, Thursdays and Fridays from October 25, 2018 until June 7, 2019.  Students will attend 54 
sessions from 7:40 until 8:30 am.  There are two certified ENL providers, two English Language 
Arts, and two Math teachers.  The content teachers as well as the ENL providers will use 
Flocabulary, web based multi-sensory approach of using music, rhythm and rhyme to teach Tier 
II vocabulary in science, social studies, mathematics, and test-taking strategies.  The main 
language of instruction is English, but we will provide students with dictionaries in their native 
languages to support their acquisition of the academic vocabulary and Tier III content 
vocabulary.  There are three sixth grade classes of 15 students, one seventh and eighth grade 
class of 15-20 students in the Title III Morning Program. The teachers will follow a co-teaching 
model to address students' proficiency levels.  
 
The “Saturday School” will also focus on building academic language using Flocabulary and the 
top news stories from the past seven days with The Week in RAP and The Week in Rap 
Junior.  Students need to be able to recognize and choose between academic and social English 
depending on their purpose and audience.  The ENL and content teachers will provide language 
instruction to the English Language Learners using a multimedia approach during the following 
Saturdays:  November 3, 2018, December 1, 2018, January 11, 2019, February 2, 2019, March 2, 
2019, March 30, 2019, April 6, 2019, April 16, 2019, May 4, 2019, and June 1, 2019.  Students 
will differentiate between academic English (CALP) and social English (BICS) in speech and in 
writing, describe the similarities and differences between academic and social English by

participating in group discussion, and use academic (grade-appropriate) vocabulary to write in 
response to a prompt.  
 
The vocabulary words are drawn from an analysis of state tests and core reading lists.  The goal 
of the Title III supplemental program is to enrich students’ regular classroom instruction with 
additional activities that are based upon best practices and current research for ELL 
instruction.  Saturday Title III Program consists of one sixth grade class, one seventh grade class, 
and one eighth grade classes with 15-25 students in each class.  There is one certified ENL 
provider and two English Language Arts teachers that provide instruction on Saturdays.  
 
This year we plan to incorporate Title III field trip.  We plan to use funds from our Title III 
allocation to provide students with one culminating field trip on the following dates:   May 11, 
2019 or May 18, 2019 from 8:30-1:30 p.m.  The trip to the Tenement Museum will highlight 
immigration and migration stories of the past and present.  There will be opportunities for social 
interaction as well as academic discourse.  The Common Core Learning Standards addressed 
are:  Language Standards 1 and 3, Speaking and Listening Standards 1 and 6, Writing Standards 
4 and 5, Reading Standards 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10.

Throughout the school year, teachers of ELLs participate in professional learning 
communities, teacher teams, and study groups in order to learn specific strategies and techniques 
to help the students achieve their greatest potential.  In addition to what is provided at I.S. 77, on-
going professional learning sessions within the Division of English Language Learners & 
Student Support, DOE-Literacy Department, and Queens North Borough Field Support Center 
provide staff members with strategies and skills to build academic language across the content 
areas.  
Student learning and achievement increase when educators are involved in targeted professional 
development.  Teachers will need the knowledge and skills gained from the professional learning 
sessions to address students' strengths and needs.  The ENL Providers as well as the content 
teachers receive professional learning sessions during the day, in the morning or after-
school.  The professional learning sessions will also focus on how to prepare ELLs to meet the 
academic rigor of the Common Core State Standards embedded in the 
NYSESLAT.  Attendance sheets and agendas for the professional learning sessions will be kept 
in the main office.  Topics that will be addressed during these professional development sessions

path messages, and voice messages that describe upcoming events during the week and 
weekends, like the monthly parent lunch-learn workshops and Saturday workshops.   Parents 
actively listen to the facilitators of the workshop.  We use outside DOE approved vendors and 
school personnel to facilitate the workshops.  Monthly newsletters, agendas, and attendance 
sheets are kept in the main office. 
Literature in their preferred language of communication is provided during the presentation, and 
guidance counselors often participate to support the parents of I.S. 77.  The lunch-learn sessions 
are during the school day from 11-12 noon, and the Saturday parent workshops are from 9:00-
12:00.  We use the Translation and Interpretation Unit to notify parents of the activities, and 
translators are invited to accommodate the needs of our parents.  Parents of newly enrolled ELLs 
are invited to attend workshops and examine the educational options for their children.  The

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
      The teachers are using the data from the Interim Assessments, DRP, three times per year, Word Generation academic 
vocabulary program, HD Word, Great Books, Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Assessments and Pre and Post Unit 
Assessments in writing and academic vocabulary to group students and formulate differentiated instruction within the 
classroom as aligned with the Common Core State Standards.  As an MSQI (Middle School Quality Initiative) school, the 
universal screener is the DRP, administered three times per year.  Using the data from the LAP to drive instruction, students 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           56 

 

will be instructed in appropriate groups according to proficiency across the four modalities with a focus on Academic 
Vocabulary and Tier II words.  The data will provide information about student growth and areas of need in terms of academic 
vocabulary and reading comprehension for ELLs. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teacher team meetings are held at least two to three times per week to plan.  These meetings are held across content areas 
by grade as well as across grades by subject.  Some discussions during these meeting times are between teachers to share test 
results; formative assessments and summative assessments, such as the NYSESLAT results and the EDAT report.  Some of these 
discussions between teachers consist of examining and analyzing student work.  Other discussions occur between teachers 
and administrators to review social/emotional aspects of ELLs, especially SIFE and/or newcomer ELLs and providing 
interventions. Turnkey training to promote the use of new strategies learned during Professional Learning Opportunities 
(PLO) is also provided. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Throughout the school year, supervisors make instructional decisions by visiting all of the ENL classrooms. Teachers who teach 
ELLs collaborate with the literacy and content area teachers.  The teachers meet at least twice a week with their teacher teams 
to discuss curriculum (vertical and horizontal alignment), scaffolds for ELLs, the latest research on balanced literacy, and 
student data.  The student data comes from multiple sources:  formative and summative assessments, the EDAT report, 
spelling inventories, student writing and periodic student feedback.  Teachers evaluate student learning, and use this data to 
plan instruction.  Areas of need are reading comprehension, academic vocabulary and coherent, complex writing.  An 
additional area of need is the students' ability to communicate verbally through meaningful discussion.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

There is collaboration between teachers during teacher team meetings.  Teachers attend PLOs and utilize the strategies 
learned there.  Teachers also share those new strategies with their colleagues.  In addition to the classroom teacher (Tier I 
intervention), we have Academic Intervention Services (AIS).  Students are selected based on summative data.  The AIS teacher 
works closely with the classroom teacher to provide academic intervention services in another setting. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
HD Word is a multi-sensory phonics-based intervention program from Really Great Reading.  For students who are identified as 
SIFE and for ELLs who range in proficiency from newcomers to long-term ELLs, HD Word will be used three times per 
week.  This intervention includes linguisitic vocabulary so students are aware of how to identify and respond to terms during 
lessons.  Additionally, this intervention is designed to improved reading accuracy so students can read unfamiliar words, 
which, in turn, will increase their reading comprehension.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
   The majority of the ELL students tested on the expanding level  in terms of the four modalities.  Five percent (5%) of students 
scored at the entering level, with 10% scoring at the emerging level, with 25% scoring at the transitional level, with 46% 
scoring on the expanding level, and with 13% scoring on the commanding level.  With the majority of students falling into the 
expanding level, we offer support in all four modalities.  These scores allow us to see that students tend to struggle with the 
reading/writing portion of these exams.  In terms of implications for classroom instruction, it is imperative that there be more 
opportunities for building academic language, explicit reading instruction, grammar in the workshop model, and writing skills 
through word study activities and daily tasks involving the application of vocabulary into higher order thinking 
responses.  Balanced literacy within the workshop model provides the structure and grouping to facilitate instruction and 
practice in a small-group setting.

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Administrators and teachers will meet to analyze the EDAT report horizontally and vertically.  Evidence of PLOs will appear in 
planning.  Teachers who attended PLOs will turn-key train to other staff members. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

We have six classes, two per grade, which are serviced by certified content area teachers as well as five certified ENL 
teachers.  We also have a population of ELLs in the general and special education classes serviced by certified ENL 
teachers.  The certified ENL teachers use an Integrated ENL delivery, Co-Teaching model in ELA and other literacy 
based classes.  In addition, the content area teachers use ENL strategies.  Students on the Entering, Emerging and 
Transitional Levels of the NYSESLAT also receive Stand Alone services, as part of their ENL instruction.  Some groups 
get pulled out of class for a separate lesson.  Other times, that group will stay in the class but works as a separate 
group from the rest of the class.  All students are provided with differentiated, data-driven instruction to meet and 
exceed criteria for city and state learning and performance standards.  Some classes are in blocks and are 
heterogeneously grouped.  Others are homogeneously grouped.SIFE students (7%), newcomers (77%), 4-6 year ELLs 
(40%), long term ELLs (16%) and former ELLs are enrolled in the expanded learning time programs for math, reading, 
writing and speaking where the emphasis is the on building competence in the four modalities.  The incorporation of 
differentiated instruction in the classroom and the Workshop Model of Readers and Writers Workshop will help the 
ELLs in the content-based subjects by using language acquisition strategies and more proficient students to foster 
learning as modeled by the teacher.  The incorporation of technology-infused learning will add to the classroom 
teacher’s repertoire of interactive instructional approaches for the ELLs.  Some long term ELLs have been selected to 
participate in an inquiry team, as target students, based on specific criteria.  In addition to the aforementioned 
academic programs, these groups receive targeted instruction in Language Arts.  The former ELLs (students who have 
tested out within two years) are entitled to time and a half on any standardized test.  These students get additional 
support by receiving services 90 minutes per week in an integrated ENL program.   Additionally, these students are 
invited to attend the expanded learning time programs.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

We have one sixth grade class for our Dual Language Program.  There is one Dual Language teacher and various 
content-area teachers using a two-way language immersion program in a push-in model. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Students who are on the entering level receive a total of 360 minutes per week of ENL services.  Half of that time is in a 
Stand-Alone group with a certified ENL teacher.  The other half of that time is in an Integrated class in an integrated 
delivery, co-teaching model in ELA or other literacy-based classes (Social Studies, Science), where one teacher is ENL certified 
and the other teacher is either content certified or common branches (for grade 6 only).

Students who are on the emerging level receive a total of 360 minutes per week of ENL services.  One fourth of that time is in a 
Stand-Alone class with a certified ENL teacher.  One half of that time is in an Integrated class in an integrated delivery co-
teaching model in ELA where one teacher is ENL certified and the other teacher is either content certified or common 
branches (for grade 6 only).  The final fourth of that time is flexible and can be either Stand-Alone or Integrated, depending 
upon the needs of the student assessed by the ENL teacher. 
Students who are on the transitioning level receive a total of 180 minutes per week of ENL services.  At least half of that time is 
in an Integrated class in an integrated delivery,  co-teaching model in ELA or other literacy-based classes (Social Studies, 
Science), where one teacher is ENL certified and the other is either content certified or common branches (for grade 6 
only).  The other half of the time is flexible and can be either Stand-Alone or Integrated, depending upon the needs of the 
student assessed by the ENL teacher.  Students who are on the expanding level receive a total of 180 minutes per week of ENL 
services.  All of that time is during an Integrated class in an integrated delivery, co-teaching model in either ELA or another 
content area subject (Social Studies, Science). 
Students who are on the commanding level receive a total of 90 minutes of ENL services, as per CR Part 154.  All of that time is 
during an Integrated class in an integrated delivery,  co-teaching model in either ELA or another content area subject (Social 
Studies, Science) or in another approved service.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   In our ENL program, content area classes are taught only in English.  There is home language support throughout the content 
area classrooms.  Some texts books are bilingual or have bilingual glossaries.  Each ENL content classroom provides access to 
bilingual dictionaries.  There are vocabulary words with images posted in the classrooms as well. Charts and posters on the 
classroom walls have sentence frames and models of how proper English works, providing a print-rich environment as 
resources for ENL students to use constantly.  Students have access to translation services via laptops, chrome books and 
tablets, Teachers of the content areas have had professional development in ENL methodologies as well as scaffolding and 
differentiated instruction. These are designed to provide multiple entry points.  The curricula taught in any of the content area 
classes are aligned with the Common Core.  All students in the school are taught the same curricula.  In the ENL classes, there 
are scaffolds and differentiated lessons to allow the ELL students to reach the same curricular outcomes as the rest of the 
school.    Instruction is given in a workshop model.  During the lesson, there is ample modeling and practice before the 
students work on the task at hand or the skill being taught.  Heterogeneous grouping is used.  A more proficient student will 
be put in the same group as a newcomer since students learn from their peers.  Prompts and tasks are worded to 
accommodate English proficiency levels to assure multiple entry points for all ELLs.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  The Dual Language teacher plus the content teachers using various formative assessments.  Since this is new for IS 77, we will 
update more specifically as our program progresses. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

SIFE students are placed in small groups for targeted, data driven instruction.  High interest, lower level materials are used in 
the content area classes to assure exposure to and comprehension of grade appropriate curricula.  A certified ESL teacher 
works with these students during their ELA periods.  Vocabulary and content are tiered, and lessons and tasks are 
differentiated, based on each student's ability.  This differentiation provides the appropriate scaffolds to allow students to 
progress to the next level.  There will be a focus on the social/emotional aspects of ELLs so teachers can focus on their 
strengths, for example, how they identify themselves and what their interests are.  Technology is infused into many lessons 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           59 

 

and tasks to stimulate the growth of academic language in all modalities.  Newcomer students (0-3 years in US schools)are 
required to follow the theme of all ELA curricula.   
  
Newcomers who are required to take the ELA work in guided groups targeting needed skills based on the analyses of student 
work, classroom observation and/or the item skills analysis report (based on the previous school year’s ELA and NYSESLAT 
results).  ENL and ELA teachers coordinate their planning.  They build lessons by differentiating and tiering content and 
concept academic vocabulary, reading materials based on reading proficiency levels, as well as teacher-created materials.  The 
constant use of technology as a teaching tool and a resource for students to use also stimulates the growth of academic 
language in all modalities. 
  
             ELLs in US schools for 4 to 6 years are responsible for following the theme of all ELA curricula.  The ENL teacher along 
with the ELA teacher differentiate and tier lessons and tasks.  As with the newcomers, the data used to provide appropriate 
differentiation comes from student work, classroom observations and the item skills analysis report based on the previous 
school year’s ELA and NYSESLAT results.  The ENL and ELA teachers align their tasks and lessons to the Common Core Learning 
Standards.  Tasks are tiered so all students in this category can reach their goals of improving reading and writing.  The 
constant use of technology as a teaching tool and a resource for students to use also stimulates the growth of academic 
langauge in all modalities. 
  
              Long Term ELLs (student who have completed a minimum of 6 years) are also responsible for following the same ELA 
curricula theme as the other ELLs in the classes.  Lessons planned together by the ELA and ENL teachers provide scaffolding in 
vocabulary and reading comprehension.  Small and guided target groups are created based on data from the pre-assessments 
and the EDAT report.   Differentiated materials and teacher-created materials are also used.  Multiple entry points are 
provided for tasks and prompts so the Long Term ELLs have equal access to assignments.  The constant use of technology as a 
teaching tool and a resource for students to use also stimulates the growth of academic language in all modalities. 
  
              Former ELLs, within 2 years of testing commanding, are given a minimum of one year transition, from a full class of 
ELLs, to a class with native English speakers and other former ELLs.  Former ELLs receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL 
instruction.  These services are provided in a content area, which could be ELA, Social Studies or Science.  They are given ELL 
accommodations for all state and local assessments.  Those accommodations include time and a half and the use of translation 
glossaries.   
 
              ELL-Students With Disabilities (SWDs) are responsible for following the same curricula as the general education 
population.  The content area teachers plan lessons with the ENL providers to provide scaffolds in academic vocabulary and 
reading comprehension.  Students are provided with models of proper English usage in the forms of teacher modeling and 
printed resources in the classrooms.  Guided groups are used to sharpen skills for students in need of vocabulary, reading 
comprehension and writing. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
We use grade-level-standards based curriculum that addresses students social, emotional and cognitive development. For 
math, Glencoe Math is used.  For Science, Glencoe Science is used.  For Social Studies, Passport is used.  For ELA, Standards 
Based curriculum that addressed CCLS is used.  The literacy curriculum provides outstanding literature by award winning 
authors - Toni Cade Bambera, Robert Frost, Shirley Jackson, Sylvia Plath, William Saroyan, Emily Dickenson, Leo Tolstoy, Zora 
Neale Hurston, William Butler Yeats, and Isaac Bashevis Singer - to support in-depth reading, critical thinking, and writing 
activities.  Students are exposed to fiction, non-fiction, and poetry that span a range of themes, settings, and styles.  The 
various literary selections are specially chosen for their engaging vivid writing and ability to support multiple 
interpretations.  Great Books reaches its fullest expression in shared inquiry expression, where teachers and students engage 
in rigorous discussions about and interpretive question that arises from each particular story.  All teachers use Word 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           60 

 

Generation for academic vocabulary.  All teachers use technology in the forms of Promethean Boards, computers, projectors, 
tablets and document cameras (ELMOs).  Teachers use these technological materials to display powerpoint presentations, 
video clips, and varied texts.  Students are provided with bilingual dictionaries and online translations as well.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ENL teachers and case managers of our ELL-SWDs have on-going conferences to discuss differentiated planning based on IEP 
goals for students in the least restrictive environment.  Discussions in these planning sessions  include how to differentiate 
instruction so that students can reach towards and achieve their academic goals on their IEPs.  Additionally, the English 
proficiency of students will be assessed by examining current student work, pre and post, formative and summative 
assessments.:    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
HD Word is used as an intervention program.  It is a multi-sensory phonics-based program.  There is a diagnostic so teachers 
know how their students are doing.  Based on that diagnostic, teachers can customize lessons for each student in their 
targeted areas of need.   Additionally, teachers provide scaffolds across  all content areas.  Students use Word Generation, 
along with a multitude of graphic organizers.  For ELLs, Word Generation words are shown in a power point, along with the 
words in context.  ELL-SWDs have to have a conversation (turn and talk) about what they think the words mean.  Students also 
use ST Math to reinforce math skills.  Each student has an individualized program, based on their progress or areas of need in 
math.      
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are taking a deeper look at Great Books and providing necessary scaffolds for ELL and SWD students. We translate the 
stories and use the Translation and Interpretation Unit, to provide native language support.   Great Books uses a Shared 
Inquiry Discussion approach.  Students will learn how to respond to an interpretive question in a discussion that has clear 
guidelines and encourages participation from each student, depending on their proficiency levels.  For this school year, we 
have added a Dual Language class in grade 6. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  They are mainstreamed with the General Education population for 
Physical Education, Talent (chorus, drama, graphic arts or band), and lunch.  The ELL classes are part of a research grant 
through Digital DELLTA and Arts Connections.  During the Expanded Learning Time, there is a multitude of clubs that ELLs, 
along with the General Education population, that are available before and after school.  Our SBO is the Greater Ridgewood 
Youth Council (SONYC) and many of our ELLs are registered for their program, too.  The Title III Morning program takes place 
two times per week for Long Term ELLs as well as newcomer ELLs.  Our monthly Saturday Program is open to all of our English 
Language Learners.  We use Flocabulary, which is a multisensory approach of using music, rhythm and rhyme and is supported 
by a profound body of academic research.   We also use True Stories to expose them to high interest non-fiction texts. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Technological materials that are used are laptop computers, which are available in all classrooms, document cameras, 
projectors, Smartboards, Promethean Boards, kindles and tablets (in ELL-SWD classrooms).  These devices allow students 
access to online reading and vocabulary resources as well as translation websites.  Some of the materials used are HD Word, 
"Differentiated Strategies for Social Studies", "Differentiated Strategies for Science", and "Differentiated Strategies for English 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61 

 

 

Language Arts".  Other materials used for content area classes are Glencoe published Math and Science books.  Other Social 
Studies materials include US History (Holt McDougal), Spanish/English Interactive Reader and Study Guide (Holt McDougal), 
History of US (Joy Hakim), and Atlas of US History (Nystrom).  Vocabulary words displayed in classrooms have images and text, 
as well as home language translations, when necessary. ELL classes keep running cognate charts available.  Classroom 
resources and teacher-created charts are labeled to be used all year. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

We offer home language support to ENL students in a variety of ways.  There are home language textbooks available for 
reference within the content area classrooms.  The students also have access to bilingual dictionaries and translation 
glossaries. We also utilize a buddy system so that less proficient students can rely on more proficient students for some 
assistance.  There are teachers and paraprofessionals who speak various languages throughout the building.  Teachers are 
encouraged to have a print-rich environment with some home language words posted throughout the classes (for example:  a 
cognates chart)      
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

We use high interest, age appropriate themes that address social and emotional needs of adolescent, middle school 
students.    We are providing access and participation to the general ed curriculum for ELLs using a researched based literacy 
program, a multi-sensory phonics program, a multi-sensory science program and a shared inquiry approach using listening and 
speaking skills and multi-modal instruction. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We do not share a building. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
New students are not enrolled until school opens in September (or maybe a few days before).  ENL teachers are not in school 
until the first day of school, so there are no activities in school to assist newly enrolled ELLs BEFORE the beginning of the school 
year.  The ENL providers, along with the administration and the Parent Coordinator provide Parent Orientation sessions several 
times per year.   Throughout the school year, there are Title III programs offered for ELLs before and after school and on 
Saturdays, once per month.  There is also an Expanded Learning Time program before and after school.  Students have many 
choices of which ELT clubs to join.  Some of the options include homework help, reading, arts, music and sports.  There are 
certified ENL teachers along with content certified teachers trained with ENL methods teaching these supplemental classes.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

There are no language electives offered to ELLs.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We are using a Two-Way language immersion program.  Core content is taught in both Spanish and 
English on alternating days.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Throughout the school year, teachers of ELLs participate in professional development workshops, teacher teams, classroom 
intervisitations with colleagues and study groups in order to learn specific strategies and techniques.  Our entire school staff, 
which includes administration, ENL teachers, ELA teachers, Content Area teachers, Special Education teachers, 
paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, the parent coordinator, secretaries, and all related service providers that work with 
ELLs will receive professional development in order to fulfill the minimum mandate of 7.5 hours.  
Professional Development focuses on providing teachers with scaffolding and differentiated instruction strategies for teaching 
the ELLs.  It will focus on how to prepare ELLs to meet and exceed the Common Core State Standards and to show progress 
and achieve higher scores on all city and state assessments.  Topics that will be addressed during these professional 
development sessions are as follows: 
 
9/2017  Word Generation Academic Vocabulary

DRP Analysis3/2018 Reading Strategies4/2018 Writing Strategies5/2018 Using Technology to aid interactive instruction6/2018 
Analyzing Student Work and Classroom Interventions  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
There is on-going professional learning that ENL coordinator and AP provide to the teachers of English language learners.     
 The certified ENL teachers as well as the content area teachers receive professional development from outside agencies like 
the Bureau of Education Research and LEAP.  The Queens North Borough Field Support Center also offers professional learning 
opportunities for teachers of ELLs.  Many of the teachers have attended professional development sessions on best practices 
for teachers of English language learners.  The sessions explore various research-based topics on ELL pedagogy.  Some of the 
topics include building academic vocabulary, academic language, text complexity, and distinguishing language acquisition from 
learning disability.   The teachers then turnkey the professional learning to their colleagues throughout the school year.  There 
are agendas and sign-in records for all professional development sessions.  
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Individual meetings with parents of ELLs are offered every Tuesday morning.  Through  correspondence, appointments are set 
to accommodate all parents.  Interpreters will be provided if the parents do not bring an interpreter to the meetings.  If 
parents do not come with an interpreter, we make use of the Interpretation and Translation Unit via phone calls or translated 
letters.   Teachers discuss language development with the parents and explain how their children are learning in each class, by 
reading, writing, listening and speaking during class activities and homework.  Teachers also discuss how parents can help their 
children at home to encourage language development in all modalities.

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

At I.S. 77 we provide parents with orientation sessions throughout the school year.  Parent workshops and school events are 
scheduled during the morning as well as evening.  Translators are invited to accommodate the needs of our parents.  We offer 
the following: 
*Parents of newly enrolled ELLs are invited to attend workshops and examine the educational options for their children.*Back 
To School Night in September (an overview of our goals, objectives, school uniform policy, and student expectations)*Book 
Campaign Kick-Off*Reading/Writing Celebrations*Understanding the High School Application Process*Cyber-

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Joseph Miller, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Each year the team examines the data from the Home Language Survey, student registration forms, emergency 
contact cards, and the school tabulation of languages spoken at home to determine the preferred language (s) 
spoken at home by the parents and students. The team members use various ATS reports, such as the RAPL, the 
RPOB, and RHLA to research predominant languages among our ELL population. We are usually successful in 
securing translations for Spanish, Chinese, Polish, and Arabic. We work with the translations unit and have 
translators available during parent-teacher meetings.

There are several employees in the building that can communicate with the parents in their preferred language. 
At the school's parent meetings, there are always translators present who listen through headphones and 
translate the information into their preferred language (s).  

 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

The parent coordinator and school secretary keep an updated list of limited English proficient families. In the event of 
an emergency, a staff member fluent in the families' home language calls the family. If the staff member is not 
available, we will utilize the DOE's phone translation service.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

During the September staff meeting, the staff is reminded of the goals of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 as well as 
where to find it in the staff handbook that is distributed to everyone annually. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Our goal is to communicate with non-English speaking parents and provide parent access information about their 
child's educational progress and options. We have a team of individuals that translate key documents and also use the 
Translation & Interpretation Unit for written and oral translations. The school maintains copies of the Bill of Rights in 
all languages in the Parent Coordinator's Office.  

 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We will send home surveys about their translation/interpretation experiences. What worked well, what they would 
like to see done differently, any suggestions, would they use the service again? Why/why not?
