Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Vista Academy’s mission is to support all learners in reaching high levels of academic achievement, through 
intentional instruction and character education, with a detailed focus on: social and emotional health, integrity, 
respect, responsibility and perseverance.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Our course work is that of a typical middle school with one exception – The Decision Making Period (DMP). DMP is 
similar to an ethics course for children. Our scholars are exposed to many topics in this course including, but not 
limited to mindfulness, brainology, choices, improvisation, social responsibility and college and career readiness. We 
have several unique partnerships that provide opportunities to our entire school community. Specifically, our 
relationships with Access Unlimited, The Achievement Network and St. John’s University support grounding a 
significant portion of our academic, artistic and social emotional work. 

 

Located in the center of East New York/Cypress Hills Brooklyn, we service a variety of scholars and subgroups alike. 
Our school community is comprised of scholars who represent Students With Disabilities (15%), English Language 
Learners (12%), Free and Reduced Lunch (97%), Housing Recovery Act Eligible (98%) and a variety of temporary 
housing circumstances. To many, said circumstances present major challenges; however, we at Vista Academy take all 
of our scholars as they come and support them and their families in becoming their best selves. We have very specific 
supports and interventions to insure that there is consistency in our approach and outcomes. 

Vista Academy takes great pride in maintaining a reflective culture that is centered on consistent feedback, continual 
improvement, community service and actively supporting all scholars and families. Throughout the school year we 
focus on maintaining a culture of urgency, diligence and an overall readiness in order to ensure that our community 
has access to quality resources. Vista Academy’s foundation is centered on many of the elements of the Framework 
for Great Schools. Parent University is one of our large and major parent initiatives that supports our parents in 
parenting skills, understanding the Common Core Learning Standards and personal behaviors. We excel in a 
supportive environment for scholars and educators and have daily opportunities to emphasize this in our Morning 
Meetings, Educator Workspace, Common Planning Meetings and other communication systems. The educators and 
parents are very collaborative and supportive of one another using Pupil Path as a primary path of reciprocal 
communication.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Students With Disabilities (15%), English Language Learners (12%), Free and Reduced Lunch (97%), Housing Recovery 
Act Eligible (98%) and a variety of temporary housing circumstances 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our community is very feedback driven and focuses on providing actionable professional feedback to one another 
regularly. Much of this feedback has provided our team with a clear focus as we enter the 2018-2019 school year.

While Vista has made marked gains in both NYS Math and ELA exams scores with specific subgroups and overall, we 
intend to focus our pedagogy to increase and maintain the results that we have seen. Additionally, we are looking to 
make specific strides with African American scholars. To support our work, Vista will be focused on Responsive 
Teaching for the 2018-2019 school year. We will also be looking more closely at the following: 

 

Spring and Summer of 2018 have been used to make specific upgrades and additions to curriculum maps. 
Using the instructional reports from the 2018 New York State Exams as a guide, humanities maps are being 
upgraded to reflect a more structured focus on reading while math educators are looking to provide less 
scaffold and more rigor in performance tasks. To support this, educators will be attending professional 
development with multiple organizations throughout the school year. Two of such organizations are Algebra 
for All and Generation Ready 

DDI efforts have been successful for the last three years with many of the scholars. Efforts have also supported in 
developing a data driven culture at Vista Academy. In the upcoming school year, programming is being designed to 
support a more detailed and granular look at scholar outcomes. Specifically, data cycles at Vista Academy are being 
redesigned to identify target scholars for every educator as well as support educator collaboration regarding specific 
scholars.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans  

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 3 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
3.2 

The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of 
rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students. 
Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction 
(DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and 
address student achievement needs. 
The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner 
within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the 
arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities. 
Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative 
assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student 
reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

All school curricula are aligned to the CCLS, contain standard aligned performance tasks and provide scholars with 
opportunities to meet the standards. Currently we are reviewing, refining and revising the units that were created this 
year. We are explicitly looking at standard alignment, clarity of objectives and outcomes, coherence of content, infusion 
and addition of writing/reading opportunities and infusion of additional informational texts. Our goal is to enter the 
2018-2019 school year with coherent unit plans (at least a third iteration) so that educators can use their preparation 
and meeting time to focus on refinement and further development of academic/performance tasks and experiences. 
There are very specific items that we want to include in this phase: increased comparative literature, greater focus on 
the use and application of academic vocabulary and the infusion of more historical texts. The data in the instructional 
reports suggests that Vista Academy is stronger with writing compared to reading. Specifically, our scholars struggle 
with reading comprehension in the three grades. Our curriculum maps and unit plans have been upgraded to support 
growth in this area. 

Our focus on higher order thinking skills this school year will enable us to pay very specific attention to content 
standards and skills that are high leverage while presenting transferable skills for our scholars. These primarily include, 
but are not limited to the following: 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           15 

 

● Planning to provide scholars with specific questions that promote higher order thinking skills and leverage into 
additional content areas. 

● Creating viable arguments and supporting claims with text based evidence. 

● Writing tasks that are very high interest, but also high rigor. 

● Accessing small building blocks of knowledge and using said information to create strong generalizations about more 
complicated content and ideas. 

● Challenge, confirm or extend the ideas and statements of educators and peers in order to deepen understanding, 
application or knowledge base as it relates to specific ideas. 

● Analyze, review, revise and provide feedback to colleagues using a very specific protocol in order to improve the rigor, 
relevance, standard alignment, clarity and meaningfulness of work products when looking at student work and tasks. 
Educators have used our LASW protocols to deepen their work and provide scholars with clear expectations, insuring 
that tasks are student-centered, standard-based, grade appropriate, rigorous, differentiated and provide specific 
opportunity for scholars to exceed the standard as it is expressed in the CCLS. 

As we enter the 2018-2019 school year, there are particular areas that we would like to build upon to increase 
instructional rigor school-wide: 

● Even implementation of the school’s belief that our students learn best through interaction. There are classrooms 
where scholars are consistently interacting with texts, technology and one another; however, there remain classes that 
are teacher-centered with very little activity or scholar-to-scholar interaction. 

● Increase the level of questioning in all classroom to DOK levels 3 and 4 with an overall responsiveness to the needs 
expressed in scholar responses and work products . 

  Provide appropriate and explicit differentiation in all lessons. 

● Consistently check for understanding and adjust instruction throughout a lesson’s progression - Responsive Teaching.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Through strategic reading strategies, educators will infuse novel studies to facilitate differentiated instruction in 
Humanities in order to increase student reading comprehension and ensure 80% of all students show improved 
proficiency in identified priority standards as measured by ANET data by June 2019.

student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE, 
STH). 

Deepening the literacy work and links between Humanities and 
Strategic Reading while emphasizing a comprehensive/balanced 
literacy approach (Independent Reading, Shared Reading, Read 
Aloud, Guided Reading) in strategic reading). Further development 
of the Strategic Reading Curriculum by infusion of novel and author 
studies and using the work of Expeditionary Learning.  

Educators will create and present scholars with student-centered, 
task-specific rubrics that are aligned to the CCLS and guide the 
scholars’ work products with a specific focus on learner variability 
and differentiation. Scholars with disabilities, ELLs and Black scholars 
will be supported with the following:  

- Co-teachers in the general education setting 

- Flexible programming to further differentiate for scholars' needs.  

Hiring of a bilingual ENL educator to further support our ever 
increasing ELL population 

- Continued use of the AIS department with two Wilson trained 
educators and a reading specialist.  

- Specific content programming that supports long term ELL scholars 
and scholars with disabilities.

The accomplishment of our school-wide goals will depend heavily on the creative and effective allocation of school 
funding and resources. Through several partnerships and resources, we will able to support our progress toward the 
aforementioned goal:  

● The Leadership Program (In conjunction with The Lincoln Center and Brooklyn Conservatory of Music) will provide 
services for youth development, extended learning time, after school, violence prevention, character education and 
parent workshops. The program will provide scholars with Spanish, Photography, Dance, Leadership and Theatre in 
after-school settings. The use of this program will allow us to extend the reach of our OST program by providing more 
variety and space for additional scholars and their interests. We intend to continue with this partnership – Title 1 and 
Fair Student Funding  

● The Achievement Network will continue to work alongside school leadership teams to strengthen school-wide 
practice and culture of using learning standards and achievement data to get breakthrough results for scholars in low-

income communities. ANet will continue to provide an integrated system of supports to foster a data-driven culture 
throughout the school community - Title 1 and Fair Student Funding Funding 

● Generation Ready (formerly known as AUSSIE) will continue to provide professional development for the 
instructional leadership team and teachers in the areas of curricula development and best practices in Literacy and 
Math. Specifically we seek to continue this partnership and take its work to the next level by moving the work into 
classrooms with educators. The Generation Ready approach to professional development meets the individual needs 
of educators through the design, delivery and facilitation of customized job-embedded programs. We continue to see 
clear improvements in educator competency and practice -Title 1 and Fair Student Funding Funding 

● Parent University in collaboration with Access Unlimited and St. John's University (OST Partnership) will continue 
with a behavioral consultants to provide a set of workshops that support our parents in many facets of educating and 
parenting their scholars. In our wellness efforts with families, the consultants will support empowerment 
programming for men's and women's initiatives. We will use Parent Involvement and some Title I funding to support 
the programming for this initiative.  

● One full time instructional coach was promoted to a supervisory position to continue coaching, provide professional 
development, curriculum planning, modeling and reflection as well as evaluate teacher practice. The Administrator 
will continue to work in these roles – Title 1 and Fair Student Funding. 

● Per Diem will be used to support inter-visitations and professional development during the school day. - Title 1 and 
Fair Student Funding 

●A full time reading educator with Academic Intervention Services (AIS) training will provide reading supports to 
targeted scholars in the form of individual as well as small group instruction using a variety of reading programs. One 
of our most essential efforts is our Summer Professional Development for staff. This is a week of August Professional 
Development for educators that includes, but is not limited to Curriculum Design, School Culture, Logistics and 
procedures facilitated by returning Vista Educators and School Leadership.

● Vista Academy is a middle school with 485 students from grades six through eight. The school population comprises of 
(students who identify as) 25% Black, 64% Hispanic, 3% American Indian, 1 % White, 7% multi-racial, other, Hawaian and 
Asian. The current student body includes 12% English language learners and 15% special education students. Boys 
account for 49% of the students enrolled and girls account for 51%. The average attendance rate for school year 2017 - 
2018 was 93%. Suspension data indicates 17 principal’s suspensions and 6 superintendent’s suspensions for 2017-2018. 
Quality Review Report for 2016-2017 reflects a well-developed school culture in which school leaders consistently 
communicate high expectations around the Danielson Framework for Teaching to staff. The staff and leaders effectively 
communicate expectations connected to a college and career readiness path, and successfully partner with families. Its 
administration and staff share a culture of mutual accountability for these high expectations and parents, 
administration, and staff work together to support student progress toward high expectations. 

● The strengths of Vista Academy include its formation of yearlong partnership with St. John’s University. This 
partnership offers mentoring opportunities, residential experiences and an overall exposure to the culture and 
expectations of college for Vista scholars. St. John's University students, alongside Vista educators, provide after school 
tutoring with a focus on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to Vista scholars. As part of the program,

Vista scholars have attended tours and workshops on St. John’s University campus. A tour of Yale University was 
conducted in Spring 2017. Tours of Brooklyn College and York College were conducted in Fall 2017. Additionally, Vista 
Academy’s Parent University (in collaboration with St. John’s University) provides parent workshops which cover 
understanding the Common Core, College and career readiness, and supporting children’s success. 

  Another strength of Vista Academy is the level of consistent communication from the school in the form of 

teacher phone calls, in-school workshops for families, emails, report cards, access to Skedula (an online grade 
book), a data warehouse (that sends messages to families), and regular family programming. Vista 
administration consistently communicates high expectations to staff through a variety of sources including the 
daily morning meeting, staff handbook, and weekly newsletters that include the instructional focus, quotes, 
announcements, professional development focus, articles aligned to the week’s focus or observation trends, 
coaches corner and the “Elite 8 High Expectations” which are the domains of the Danielson Framework for 
Learning. The weekly newsletters provide educators with techniques for pedagogical moves such as scholar-led 
discussions, lesson planning, and data analysis. The domains include trends in the feedback to staff as a whole 
from the past week’s frequent observation cycle. Newsletters frame the week with expectations reiterated at 
morning meetings. Additionally, the administration holds staff accountable for high expectations through 
frequent observations with actionable feedback that lead to professional growth supported through inter-
visitations, coaching, and professional development. The high expectations for all stakeholders coupled with the 
focus on college and career readiness require that supportive systems remain in place to allow for the teaching 
and learning of Vista Academy’s five core values of Safety, Persistence, Attitude, Respect and Community 
(SPARC). 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Through Decision Making Period (DMP) Course, daily morning meetings, and restorative practices, 90% of students will 
communicate that they feel safe and supported as shown on the end of the year Learning Environment Survey.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-need 
student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE, 
STH). 

Daily Morning Meetings - Each morning of the school day will begin 
with a 20-minute morning meeting with the purpose of setting the 
tone for scholars and educators to embark on the day’s teaching 
and learning. These sessions will include reiteration of the Vista 
Academy core values (Safety, Persistence, Attitude, Respect and 
Community- SPARC) and engagement in mindfulness activities. Such 
intentional character education during morning meetings will 
continue to create positive, supportive relationships between all 
stakeholders. 

Decision Making Period (DMP) DMP coursework involves explicit 
immersion of scholars in positive character rituals, routines, and 
practices. In addition to morning meetings, the use of restorative 
practices and cyclical discussions in DMP will foster the 
establishment of clear behavioral expectations for scholars and 
culminate into a vibrant school life. 

 

Employment of two Guidance Counselors  

Two guidance counselors support the mission of Vista Academy 
through their work with scholars that are at risk, in crisis and for 
scholars that have mandated counseling we have been able to 
support and intervene where necessary. The guidance department 
does all of the mandated counseling, but goes above to reach new 
scholars and scholars who experience new circumstances at home. 
Their work supports the overall positive tone of the school.

In the upcoming school-year, Vista Academy will serve over 486 students with full teams of educators that will provide 
for more robust collaboration. Currently, the majority of teachers are engaged in structured, inquiry-based professional 
collaborations. There are also very strong distributive leadership structures in place. These collaborations promote the 
implementation of the CCLS while strengthening the instructional capacity of teachers. Teachers have built leadership 
capacity and have a voice in key decisions that affect student learning across the school.  

Currently, teachers meet in content and grade level teams as well as informally as needed, even daily. Teachers look at 
student work and share noticings, determine implications for classroom practice and engage in revisions to the 
curriculum. Teachers regularly visit one anothers’ classroom and provide feedback and next steps. Additionally, the 
teachers engage in data cycles that allow for adjustments in curriculum and for re-engaging scholars in previously 
learned material.  

In the upcoming school year, we look forward to implementing:  

● Weekly common planning time by content area built into Humanities and Math teacher programs.

The 2017-2018 school survey indicates the following positive response scores: 

Supportive environment N/A 

  Rigorous Instruction 3.62 
 
  Collaborative teachers 3.73 
  Effective Leadership 3.95 
 
  Trust 3.71 

Strong Family-Community Ties 3.59 

The aforementioned strengths can be attributed to the distributive leadership environment which exists at the school. It 
builds capacity amongst staff, enhances teacher development, and allows staff buy-in and ownership of their leadership 
capabilities and accomplishments. To further strengthen the distributive leadership during the 2018-2019 school year, 
teachers will be running their own pods of learning communities centered on the established instructional focus goals.

and Mathematics as measured by the Achievement Network interim assessments and the New York State Assessments.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.  
Through consistent communication of high expectations, differentiated professional development and ongoing 
observations of teacher practices with actionable feedback provided by school leadership, 80% of educators will 
demonstrate improved practice in Danielson Domain 3 (identified priority) by delivering explicitly differentiated lessons, 
engaging students in complex high order thinking questions and promoting high levels of student-to student classroom 
discussions as measured by end of year MOTP data

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

The Quality Review Report for 2016-2017 reflects a well-developed school culture (Quality Indicator 3.4) in which school 
leaders consistently communicate high expectations around the Danielson Framework for Teaching to staff. The staff 
and leadership effectively communicate expectations connected to a college and career readiness path, and successfully 
partner with families. Through a fundamental partnership with St. John’s University, Vista Academy is able to regularly 
and consistently message the importance of college readiness. The partnership will also support parent programming in 
the near future that will align with Vista Academy’s Parent University. Vista’s administration and staff share a culture of 
mutual accountability for high expectations while parents, administration, and staff work together to support student 
progress toward high expectations. Attendance rate for school year 2017-2018 was 93%. Suspension data indicated 17 
principal’s suspensions and 6 superintendent’s suspensions for 2017-2018. In the upcoming school year we intend to 
support these numbers in being lower as a result of increased use of restorative practices.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           45 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Vista Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Vista Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand;

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community; 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act; 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
In order to determine the grouping for our ENL scholars, we analyze their NYSESLAT and 
NYSITELL scores. We track students' progress throughout the year by administering Finish Line 
New York ELLs Bilingual Common Core Assessments every two months. We also analyze their 
portfolio assignments, as well as check for understanding throughout each class period. We 
service ELLs in grades 6-8. We service Newcomers, Middle Year ELLs, Long Term ELLs, 
Special Education ELLs, SIFE and Former ELLs.  These selected scholars attend an after school 
program every Wednesday and Thursday from 2:30 PM to 3:30 P.M. They also attend Saturday 
Academy  on Saturdays from 9:00AM to 11:00AM. After school program will take place 
September 17, 2018 through June 12, 2019 for a total of sixty-six sessions. Saturday Academy 
will take place September 22, 2018 though April 27, 2019 for a total of twenty-three 
sessions.  After school and Saturday Academy are both designed to support students' academic 
needs. Newly admitted ENL scholars work with ENL educators, Ms. Leichman, Mr. Bastias and 
Ms. Roedig on content based instruction, which is geared towards accelerating their academic 
language acquisition.  Our Saturday Academy program is  designed in a way that allows for 
Team Teaching between the Ms. Leichman (ENL teacher), Mr. Saleh (Math Teacher) and Ms. 
Espinosa (Humanities Teacher). Mr. Bastias engages in Team Teaching with Ms. Cambria (Math 
Teacher). During Saturday Academy, ENL educators and content area teachers use the following 
materials:  IReady and Connected Mathematics 3, Finish Line New York ELLs, Arabic and 
Spanish Dictionaries and Thesauruses, Urban Underground (Saddleback), and Moby Max.  The 
materials are purchased.  The rationale for the strategies and materials mentioned is to develop 
academic English through structured activities that develop all four (4) modalities: listening, 
reading, speaking and writing.

Part C: Professional Development  
well as conduct some PD in our school. This helps our staff become more knowledgeable in 
methods that can be used in classrooms to reach our ELL and immigrant population. Our goal is 
to allow content teachers to learn how to best support ELLs in the classroom. We want content 
teachers to develop skills that will best support the ELL population, such as using scaffolds to 
assist with reading comprehension and writing.  Bernard Addo and Kimberly 
Smith (administrators),  provide professional development to staff. Reggie Stephens (Generation 
Ready Consultant),  Boma Jack (Generation Ready Consultant) and Jessica Urraca (Consultant) 
provide ongoing series on Differentiation. 
Dates and topics are scheduled as follows: 
1.  September 17, 2018 Topic: Using Data to Plan for Differentiation 
2.  September 24, 2018 Topic: Creating Engaging Student-Centered Activities for ENL students 
3. October 15, 2018 Topic: Using Questioning to Engage ENL Students 
4. November 5, 2018 Topic: Using the Workshop Model to Differentiate for All Learners. 
 
To supplement the professional development provided by administrators, staff will be given 
opportunities to attend off-site professional development sessions held by the NYCDOE and 
other outside providers. 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact 
higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as 
parent orientation during ELL identification process.

 
  name of provider 
  how parents will be notified of these activities 

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
Parent engagement is a vital component for student achievement and success. We want to make 
sure that we are providing parents with as many activities, meetings and chances to be involved 
in their children's education. On the first Wednesday of every month, a Parent Association 
meeting will be held during which time parents will discuss ways to help at the school, plan 
events for the scholars and staff and talk about neighborhood events that impact students. 
Additionally, Parent University will be held once every other month on Saturdays to inform ENL 
parents about high school applications, NYSESLAT, citizenship, high school orientation, college 
readiness, immigration reform, health care and many other important topics. Every two months, 
the parent coordinator, Ms. Gonzalez and Ms. Leichman will hold a meeting for parents of ENL 
students. The agenda will  include NYSESLAT and ways to support ENL children with their 
academics. Parents will be notified of orientations and workshops via newsletters that are 
backpacked home, school calendar, phone messenger and via the school website and 
Vista App.  Raquel Gonzalez (Parent Coordinator) will translate all letters into Spanish.  For 
translations in other languages, we contact the translation and interpretation unit of the DOE 
translate into Arabic and Haitian Creole. Our end goal is to make sure that all  parents are aware 
of their children's rights and ways that parents can best support their children.   
Specific Topics and workshop dates are scheduled as follows:

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs through the NYSITEL and our online literacy program, MyOn. The data provided 
by the  NYSITEL allows us to assess the literary skills of our Spanish speaking ELLs in their native language. MyOn provides us 
with literacy skills in Spanish and English. The data shows that those who score higher on the NYSITEL  have higher literacy 
skills in English, as well. Our Arabic ELLs tend to have lower early English literacy skills than our Spanish speakers. Our Long-
Term ENLs have lower literacy skills than those who are not Long-Term ELLs. It seems that their literacy skills are a contributing 
factor as to why they are not testing out of the ENL program. This data helps with instructional planning because we are able

to figure out which students would continue to benefit from the Wilson Reading Program, which is used at our school. The 
data also  enables us determine which students need more scaffolding with literacy-related lessons.     
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

There is programmed/scheduled time for common planning among ELL teachers. Additionally ELL teachers push into 
Humanities classroom and work collaboratively with teachers to analyze MyOn data as well as performance tasks to 
differentiate instruction in the classroom. Ongoing meetings between ELL teachers and administrators allow for discussions 
centered around the progress made by ELL students.. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 The assessment tool that we use to assess growth throughout the year is the NYSESLAT.   2017-2018 NYS student performance 
data will determine whether we met our Annual Measurable Achievement Objectives (AMAO) goals and  whether ENL 
students made Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP).  We will examine how many of our students moved into a proficient rating on 
NYSESLAT, and how many of our students moved up levels on the NYSESLAT both overall and within each modality. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Presently, there are three ELL providers who have each targeted grades 6,7, 8 respectively. The provider utilize both push-in 
and pull-out models of intervention based on the data analysis. Beginning ELLs are mostly pulled out for targeted skills based 
instruction while the rest of our ELLs receive push in services with the ELL providers differentiating the work for ELLs inside 
Humanities classrooms. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We serve grades 6, 7 and 8. Intervention programs used include Wilson for decoding and phonemic awareness for beginning 
ELLS. MyOn and Flocabulary are used to build reading stamina, teach skills and track reading and language acquisition progress 
of all other ELLs. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
NYSITEL is administered to entering student. NYSITEL data over three years indicate that most scholars entering the NYCDOE 
from a different country are at entering English proficiency level . We notice growth within a year of enrolment with our 
entering/emerging ELLs; however, many of our Long-Term ELLs remain stagnant. Additionally, some of our Long-Term ELLs are 
Students With Disabilities. We plan to engage our Long-Term ELLs in After School and Saturday programs to provide them with 
additional reading and writing skills/strategies.   Student reading progress is tracked with MyOn reading program. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Scheduled common planning times allow for staff to meet and engage in data analysis and inquiry work. During these sessions 
ENL provider  engages classroom/content teachers in collaborative inquiry work to discuss the data as well as strategies to 
differentiate their work with ELLs.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

We provide a freestanding ENL program for them. Entering ENLs receive 360 minutes of pull-out services per 
week. Emerging level ENLs receive 360 minutes of push-in and pull-out services.  Transitioning and Advanced ENLs 
receive 180 minutes of push-in services. Proficient ENLs who have tested out continue to receive 90 minutes per week 
of  push-in services.  For pull-out services, 6  th   and 7  th   graders may be clustered and instructed together. Grade 8 
ENLs are instructed together as a group. This model has proven successful and we plan to continue with it.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not Applicable    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Not Applicable 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 ENL minutes are delivered through a combination of pull-out and push-in models. ENL teachers push into Humanities 
classrooms to deliver instruction and pull out emerging ENLs at strategic times to deliver instruction . Entering and emerging 
receive 360 instructional minutes per week. Transitioning and advanced ELLs receive 180 instructional minutes while advanced 
and proficient ELLs receive 90 minutes for two additional years.     
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
All ENL instruction is delivered in English. Sheltered English Model is used to ensure that all ENLs are acquiring the English 
Language. We use the INSIDE program to support our goals. We align all of our ENL instruction and content instruction to the 
CCLS. All lessons are strategically planned to meet the content and language objectives and are aligned to Common Core 
standards. In content area classes, educators differentiate for ENLs by scaffolding their lessons to ensure that ENL scholars are 
learning the content. Teachers often provide definitions in both English and scholars' native language, as well as, translate the 
learning objective and do now. All ENL scholars receive translation dictionaries, which they can use in their respective 
classes.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We ensure that ENLs are appropriately evaluated by giving them the option to take periodic school wide and classroom 
exams/assessments in their native languages. Most entering ENLs choose to take their exams in English and Spanish. When 
ENLs move up in proficiency levels, they prefer to take exams in English. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61 

 

a. Almost all of our SIFE students have challenges encoding and decoding. We incorporate the Wilson program into the 
curriculum to support with their reading and writing abilities.  
b. For our newcomers, we provide scaffolds as necessary.  For example, we give them additional vocabulary practice and 
worksheets in English with translations in their native language, to foster higher level academic vocabulary acquisition.  We 
also pair newcomers with students who have been in the country longer to help answer questions and support their academic 
adjustment/achievement.   
c. We provide long term ENLs with increasing text complexity in reference to writing, reading, speaking and 
listening.  We challenge them to use their English skills even when they are frustrated and would rather fall back to their native 
language.  We differentiate by providing them with and challenging them to read level-appropriate texts independently.  We 
provide further differentiated tasks during After school and Saturday sessions using the INSIDE writing program along with the 
Prentice Hall Writing Coach..  
e. Differentiation for ENLs up to two years after exiting ENL status occurs when the ENL teacher pushes into their Humanities 
classrooms twice a week (90 minutes) to to provide targeted differentiation of what the content teacher is teaching..  
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
We use strategies such as guided note taking, sentence starters, and scaffolded worksheets to help support our ELL-SWDs. We 
provide access to technology to support with academic content and acceleration of English language development. Through 
data analysis, we have determined that many of our ELL-SWDs are Long-Term ENLs who continue to struggle with reading and 
writing. Through technology and MyON, we are able to provide them with the practice that they need to improve on these 
skills. Our After-school program focuses on content through writing as almost all of our ELL-SWDs are Long-Term ENLs and 
struggle mostly with writing . We use the INSIDE program to support this initiative. Additionally, the ELL teacher pushes in to 
the 12:1:1 and ICT classrooms once a week to provide language support in content areas. thereby providing ELL-SWDs access 
to academic content and accelerated English language development.                 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Through flexible programming, ELL-SWDs attend content classes with general education students. Additionally, the ENL 
teacher pushes into the general education classes for which ELL-SWDs are programmed.  The ENL teacher collaborates with 
content-area teachers to to ensure that content-area teachers implement differentiated strategies  enable ELL-SWDs achieve 
their IEP goals in the least restrictive environment.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 Specific intervention programs provided include After school and Saturday Academy ELA and math classes for ENLs with 
services provided by the ENL teacher, math and Literacy teachers. Additionally, year round Lunch-and-Learn  opportunities are 
provided for ENLs.  The ENL teacher works closely with the ELA, math and science content teachers and  provides them with 
graphic organizers and vocabulary strategies  to ensure that differentiated academic vocabulary supports are provided for 
ENLs.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Through a District-wide comprehensive literacy initiative that will be thought through a strategic reading course, independent 
and guided reading will be highly emphasised. The selection of the levelled independent reading books coupled with guided 
reading groupings and targeted, differentiated instruction will further support language acquisition, reading and writing 
skills  for ENLs. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62 

 

We do not have a bilingual program as all instruction with scaffolds is provided in English; however, google translate and 
Spanish-English dictionaries are made available to support ENLs. 
 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ENLs are offered access to all school wide programs including After school and Saturday Academy programs.  After school 
programs include homework help and a wide variety of electives. We also provide specific reading and writing ENL after school 
class for ENLs. ENL students are supported by bilingual paraprofessionals during those classes. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 MyOn  digital library and books come in both English and Spanish. Culturally-based novels are available in our strategic 
reading courses. We also provide Spanish-English dictionaries as well as Google translate via ipads and laptops to ENLs.     
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

At registration, the home language survey is administered by the ENL teacher. The ENL teacher gives an informal interview and 
administers a a formal assessment that tests their academic performance in their home language.  We work with the 
interpretation team to provide all pertinent information to them in their home language.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The ENL teacher collaborates with IEP Coordinator to ensure that ELL-SWDs'  IEP goals are SMART and recommended services 
are delivered. The ENL teacher, keeps track of materials used for instructional delivery and makes certain that they are age and 
grade appropriate. The tracking of resources and assessments allow for alignment between the goals and and the attainment 
of such goals. .   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Resources in the form of books and technology are provided in the library which is shared by both co-located schools. . The 
MyOn digital library and books come in both English and Spanish and is used by both schools. Additionally, the salary of the 
librarian is a shared responsibility for both co-located schools. .      
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
All newly enrolled ELLs meet with the ENL teacher, parent coordinator and are introduced to all Spanish speaking 
teachers/staff. We do this so they know who to turn to if they have any questions or need help with a specific content area. 
The ENL teacher and parent coordinator give newly enrolled ELLs a tour of the school and pair them up with other students 
with similar background and may speak their native language for support. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish Club is offered in our after school program.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63 

a-e) Not applicable, we do not offer a dual language program.    
 

 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The ENL teacher conducts Professional Development sessions  for staff throughout the school year. The sessions primarily 
focus on strategies for content-area teachers to differentiate instruction for ENL students. Additionally, ENL teacher and 
content teachers are registered for DOE and non-DOE-sponsored workshops  to to further learn best practices for working 
with our ENL population. . We also schedule inter visitations for teachers to observe and learn best practices within the school 
building. 
We will continue to seek out specific off-site CCLS engaging  workshops to support ENL and content teachers integrate CCLS in 
their differentiation for ELLs.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
As ELLs transition from elementary school to middle school, they are very dependent on the teacher. We encourage them to 
advocate for themselves and constantly enforce that their need to become more independent. We also make it a priority to 
find out what ELL models were used at their previous school (push in, push out, inclusion) to inform our decision on what 
methods would work best with individual and groups of students. This information is disseminated to teachers and helps with 
the professional development plan for teachers. 
Teachers attend ELL-specific professional development sessions. Agendas, topics covered and attendance records are 
maintained by the personnel secretary.  .  
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
 ELL parent workshops are held on site. Invitations are sent to parents via monthly calendars and by school messenger 
telephone system.  The first of such meetings usually takes place at the beginning of the school year and is facilitated by the 
parent coordinator, ENL teacher and some content teachers. Translation services are provided at these workshops. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parent orientation for incoming students occurs in August. At the orientation, a workshop is held for ELL parents. An overview 
of our ENL program is given and a schedule for upcoming ELL parenting workshops is provided. Additionally, ELL parents are 
invited on school trips and celebratory events held at the school. An open door policy maintained by the parent coordinator, 
who is bilingual, enables ELL parents to readily come to the school for supports as well as address any specific concerns. School 
mailings and calendars to parents are provided in English and languages other than English. We plan to hold monthly meetings 
with ENL families to  support with their transition into the United States.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Bernard Addo, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

(*Primary) 

 

   

 
* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

During enrollment, parents who require assistance are given such assistance with completetion of the home 
language survey. The ENL teacher will review the home language survey to determine the prefered language and 
decide if the student needs to be given an ELL identification interview. The ENL educator, along with the school 
secretary, takes notice of question two of Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey and compiles the 
data. Additionally, during enrollment intake, pupil accounting secretary asks for parent language preference. 
These two methods have helped us establish that languages other than English, Spanish, Arabic and Chinese are 
the the languages spoken in the homes of our students. As of now, our language preferences are English, Spanish, 
Arabic, Chinese, and Bengali. Every year, we create an updated report of these langauge preferences to make sure 
that we are using a form of communication in the language that the parents prefer.

Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

At the start of each school year, the ENL teacher recieves a list of new admits, non-entitled Ls and continued entitled 
Ls. She will go through the identification process with the new admits and will send a letter home and call the parents 
letting them know that their child is entitled to receive ENL, DL or TBE according to their test score on the NYSITELL. A 
parent orientation will be scheduled and this where the parent receives all parent notification letters in their home 
language. The parent coordinator will assist them with filling out the paper work if that parent speaks Spanish. All 
other languages will be conducted in their native language through the T&I Unit. All continued entitled Ls will get a 
parent notification letter sent home in their native language that is to be signed and returned to school. The non-
entitled Ls will get a lettre sent home in their native language, as well. All of these letters are accessed through the 
NYCDOE parent notification portal. We also make sure that parents receive their bill of rights and guide to language 
access in their native language. We provide them with numbers to call if they have any questions.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the

the best methods to communicate with our families.
