Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year.

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Goal- Build upon and refine previously established structures for teacher-team meetings so teachers can engage in 
cooperative professional development opportunities communicating a culture of respect and motivation for continuous 
improvement. 100% of all teacher-team meetings held during designated common planning time will utilize the same 
structure and protocols with every teacher taking on at least one leadership role in their team this year.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed 
to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

 

Professional Development - whole staff and department 
meetings. At least 4 whole school P.D. led by teachers, all 
department meetings led by teachers. Focus on Danielson’s 
Framework: Domain 1: 1e Designing Coherent Instruction and 
Domain 4: 3b Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques. 
Professional development should help guide our staff towards 
“inquiry based learning”, or creating, modeling and evaluating 
rigorous tasks. Teaching on best practices providing students 
necessary support, tools and practice inside a forty minute 
period, as well as a one to two month unit. 

Transparency – shared mission statements should be shared 
with all staff. Our shared mission should be communicated on a 
monthly basis – either in writing and/or verbally. 

Inter-visitations - Communicate with staff in email and in person 
about year round opportunities and clear expectations for inter-
visitations and debriefings. Staff are required to visit at least one 
teacher / domain and debrief with that teacher. 

Use collected data – at the end of the year, alter mission 
statement / goals / action plans / and how we’ll monitor new 
goals/action plans

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths—Many of our school’s partners provide professional development in addition to the professional 
development opportunities we offer teachers within the school building. Some of the partners include Working in 
Support of Education (WISE), National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE), Virtual Enterprise, National 
Academy Foundation, Global Glimpse, Theater Development Foundation, and Math for America. Teachers have the 
opportunity to participate in a wide array of professional development activities through these partner organizations. 
Additionally, time is built into our school schedule for teachers to collaborate on instruction as well as develop strong 
Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) relationships. Our SDC develops the professional development topics and schedule for 
our faculty-wide professional development held throughout the year. One notable contribution was the development 
and roll-out of a five week series of workshops led by the leadership team centered on specific components of the 
Danielson Framework. All teachers attended these five workshops which were focused on engaging students, using 
assessments in instruction, using questioning and discussion techniques, managing student behavior, creating an 
environment of respect and rapport as well as lesson planning (i.e. designing coherent instruction). All teachers had 
an opportunity to both attend and conduct professional development during each month of the academic year. 

 

Needs—There is an ongoing need for more time for teachers to collaborate and there is a need to develop a specific 
structure and protocols for this collaboration time (teacher-team meetings). There is a need to ensure this structure 
and these protocols include examining student work and examining data to inform instruction. There is a need to 
have more student-focused meetings so teachers can share best strategies across disciplines to create instruction that 
is customized, inclusive, and aligned to Common Core Learning Standards. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
Develop and establish structured teacher-team meetings so teachers can have the opportunity to participate in 
cooperative professional development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 100% of all teacher-
team meetings held during designated common planning time will utilize the same structure and protocols.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed 
to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

 

Train the School Development Committee (SDC) and lead 
teacher (i.e. course leaders) on the tools adapted from 
“Teaching Matters” to use during teacher-team meetings (i.e. 
Norm-setting protocol, establishing meeting agendas, and 
establishing ongoing teacher-team action plans).  

 

Meet with each teacher-team to conduct norm-setting 
protocol which establishes how individual teams will 
collaborate during all common planning sessions. Develop 
calendar of agenda items for subsequent meetings and 
ongoing action plan that focus on building collaboration and 
designing rigorous instruction that is informed by student data 
and aligned with Common Core Learning Standards. 

 

Meet with each teacher to discuss their individual professional 
development plan and goals they have for themselves and 
their students and establish which teacher-teams they will join.  

At each meeting questions will be asked and time will be spent 
discussing strategies each teacher will use to ensure successful 
outcomes for students with disabilities, English language 
learners, and other high-need students. Further, time will be 
spent discussing ways to make sure that teacher-parent 
collaborations are addressed, through the use of Jupiter 
Grades, and other methods of communicating with parents 
more frequently.

regular basis. Our school's QR states that :the conscientious principal has created a goal-oriented learning community 
which uses data-based intentional strategies to accelerate learning, and is well focused on teacher practice and 
student outcomes. However, we should extend pedagogical practices so that all students are consistently engaged in 
high academic levels to maximize learning and achievement. Our school has chosen Component 3c-Engaging Students 
in Learning with an emphasis on equity and culturally relevant taks for the 2018-19 school year. The school 
established a Strategic Instructional Action plan for the year around this goal.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Family and community ties are primarily overseen by the guidance department inclusive of, one administrator, two 
guidance counselors, one college advisor, one parent coordinator and multiple on-site SBST and CBO workers (Liberty 
Partnership Program and Educational Talent Search. Additional Community Based Organizations include Big Brother 
Big Sister, Bottom Line, Opportunity Network, Scholars for Education Opportunity.) The Assistant Principal of 
Organization is primarily responsible for much of the online and electronic communication from the school. 

Strengths : 

· Communication with parents, students and teachers at minimum every Monday by sending out an email entitled, 
“Weekly Reminders and Announcements”, to inform them of upcoming events, testing blocks, end of marking period 
dates, school happenings, and student accomplishments, among other notifications. Including outside organizations 
and workshops recommended and promoted on the DOE’s webpage. 

·A full comprehensive Calendar for the school year is also available via Jupitergrades. While parents are checking 
student grades, they have the ability to check the calendar tab and review all upcoming events. 

· Transformation of the school’s website to a place where all faculty, students, parents and staff could visit to keep 
themselves informed of all school happenings. When the school’s end of year schedule was posted on the website, 
which included all Regents tutoring dates and times, social events, and final exam dates and times. The school’s 
website was visited 16,544 times in the month of May and June. That is approximately 22 visits per family over a two 
month period. 

· Long standing relationships with CBO’s while fostering new relationships each year. 

· Provide students with the opportunity to interact with the professionals in the financial district and beyond through 
our annual career day, monthly job shadowing opportunities and WISE Institute seminars. 

Needs: 

· Based on the schools quality review results, parents need to be informed as to what college ready requirements are, 
and what their children must do in order to accomplish these goals.  

· Develop anonymous polls through the schools online grading system where students log in and vote on things clubs 
and activities they would like to see the school start.

The Instructional Focus for the school year is Engaging Students in Learning with an emphasis in equity, culturally 
relevant curriculum and instructional excellence.  

The school administration and the teacher course leaders meet to determine appropriate subjective and objective 
type questions to use in common mid-term and final examinations. These examinations emulate State assessments 
such as Regents, Common Core Tests, and others. Data analysis is used from the results of these tests to make 
decisions in curriculum planning, differentiation in learning activities and remediation for students who require 
additional support. 

The school follows a methodology in most classes in the Gradual Release of Responsibility which incorporates several 
assessment type techniques in each lesson.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. High School fo Economics and FInance, in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The High School of Economics & Finance will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

The HS of Economics and Finance seeks to create a Supplemental, Title 3, LEP enrichment class 
called “The History and Literature of New York for ELL Students.” ELL students who 
participate will develop increased critical thinking skills and important academic writing skills. 
The program will enhance their ELA and Social Studies academic skills and their English 
language development. 
The classes will be conducted on Wednesday and Friday between 3:15pm – 5:15pm (2 hours a 
day, 2 days a week, 2 teachers for class, for 16 weeks (Jan 16, 30, Feb 1, 6, 8, 13, 15, 27, March 
1, 6, 13, 16, 20, 27, 29, April 3, 5, 10, 12, 17, May 1, 3, 8, 10, 15, 17, 22, 24, 29, 31). These two 
Title 3 classes will be taught by two teachers (an ESL teacher and a Social Studies teacher for 
one class and one ESL and one English teacher for the other class.) Classes will be conducted in 
a team-teaching model. In both classes, at least 50% of direct instruction will be taught by the 
ESL teacher.    
Both classes will focus on the development of students’ academic writing in various genres and 
formats, including essays, research papers, and others. Students will practice all the language 
modalities with emphasis on reading, writing, and speaking. The topics that are included in the 
after school curriculum will be further explored through trips and various multi-media 
presentations and experiences, as well as traditional literature. 
Students will attend a series of trips which will be used as a springboard for writing prompts and 
support for a study of the historical eras. Students will work with fiction, non-fiction, and visual 
sources to study New York City. These trips will explore important NYC landmarks and are 
integral to the study of NY history and literature. Title 3 money will be used to pay any 
admission fees and per session for teacher-leaders. 
Materials to be purchased will include fiction and non-fictional work on the history of New 
York. These will include Forever by Pete Hamill and Gotham by Wallace and Boroughs. Chart 
paper, markers, printer paper will also be purchased to be used exclusively by this class.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The early literacy skills of our ELLs will be assessed through teacher-made, leveled assessments which will be modeled after 
the reading section of the NYSESLAT exam. Through the use of these assessments, teachers will be able to ascertain the 
language and syntax level ofour ELLs. Information from these exams will provide insight into a student’s ability in areas of 
decoding, syntax, comprehension, andvocabulary usage. This will inform our instruction around reading activities and skill 
building throughout the year. Teachers of ELLs willprovide independent reading support throughout the year to further 
develop students’ literacy skills. All ELLs take the NYSESLAT and scores are taken from the Language Modality Report. Our 
qualitative observations have led us to modify our instructional practice to include the reinforcement of literacy skills in all 
content area classes which include ELLs. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We evaluate the success of our programs regularly through observing teacher practice and making recommendations for 
improvement as well as analyzing students' performance abilities in all classes.     
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
After analyzing additional data, it has come to our attention that the majority ofstudents who remain at the same level are 
those students who have the lowest attendance in the school. Besides modifying ourinstructional practice to address the 
needs of ELLs across the curriculum, we are continuing our outreach to improve the attendance of theELLs with weak literacy 
skills to help them achieve a higher literacy level and advance on the NYSESLAT. The majority of our ELLs articulate from 
middle school, so we do not have enough LABR date to support a trend analysis.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Insturction is delivered through stand-alone and integrated ENL classes. Students are grouped based on their English 
Profiency Level and their grade level.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

n/a 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

n/a    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           The assistant principal and program chair of the LAT team, reviews all ELL programs based on their English Proficiency 
Level.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Students are programmed for all appropriate content core classes.  Teachers are provided with professional development 
and at common planning instructional methods are shared.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   All students admitted to HSEF from NYCDOE schools regardless of entrance grade carry their ESL status with them. All ELL 
studentsreceived have access to proper ELL services based on their ELL designation. All students admitted to HSEF from non 
NYCDOE schoolsare given the HLIS. The HLIS is evaluated by Steven Squillante who is an assistant principal in the school. If 
deemed necessary, school staff members will conduct the interview through a translator in thestudent’s native language. Once 
schools staff collect HLIS from parents and determine that a language other than English is spoken in thechild’s home the child 
is administered the LAB-R. Each year, all students with ELL status take the NYSESLAT exam, regardless if theyare “x-coded” or 
not. The list of students, security, and integrity of the exam are handled by Ms. Hernandez, GC and Mr. Dillon the school’s 
testing coordinator. Once results are known, parents are informed of the services they are entitled to by having the 
appropriate  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Formative and Summative assessments are given throughout the year.  Teachers are asked to include strategies in lessson 
plans to ensure for differentiated instruction.     
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
For ELL-SWDs, we follow the mandates of their individual IEPs. They all receive the requisite amount of ESL instruction. Their 
teachers and paraprofessionals provide these students with differentiated support. They are also encouraged to attend the 
Homework Center and tutoring sessions. We also support ELL-SWDs with testing accommodations (time extension, separate 
location, bilingual glossaries and dictionaries) and additional tutoring sessions for Regents exams and the NYSESLAT.  A mutli-
cultural club has also been organized.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
  All ELL-SWDs are programmaed based on their IEP and State mandates.  All of them have opportunities in both classroom 
settings and outside the classroom to interact with their peers. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
For ELA, our ELLs are supported by teachers who have developed ELL teaching techniques through ongoing professional 
development.Our school library offers all ELLs literature and reference material differentiated by reading level in order to 
support them in both theirEnglish and content-area classes.  For math, science and social studies, all ELLs are offered one-on-
one tutoring during the schoolday and after school. Learning Leader volunteers also work with ELLs during their lunch periods. 
In addition, the ESL guidancecounselor and all teachers of ELLs meet for academic reviews on an ongoing basis. The ESL 
guidance counselor meets with parents of ELLs (translators are made available) to keep them abreast of their child’s progress. 
Parents can also check the progress of their childrenby accessing Jupiter Grades, a program all teachers are required to use.  A 
two-year sequence in algebra an d Living Enviornment is also offered for those who may need additional support.

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 We have purchased an on-line reading program called Reading Horizons and expect the ESL teacher to utilize the program 
often. We will also continue our effective programs and initiatives from the past.   Former ELL students are all receive an 
additional 90 minutes per week of services.  A new multi-cultural club has been established.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We are not discontinuing any programs/services.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All students at the HS of Economics & Finance are invited to join all curricular and extracurricular activities, such as the 
Academy of 
Finance, the National Honor Society, student government, mentoring programs, athletics, academic clubs, social clubs, and 
school 
performances. This year, the student government is making a special effort to invite and encourage ELLs to join these 
extracurricular 
activities. In addition, our school hosts a club fair for the entire school at the beginning of the term. This gives ELLs the 
opportunity to 
talk one-on-one with students who are already involved with that activity. For the above mentioned academic programs, ELLs 
must fulfillthe same prerequisites as non-ELLs but are offered additional guidance when filling out applications. Currently, ELLs 
are presented in allprograms available at our school. Title III money is used to fund programs specific to ELLs. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional materials for newcomers, ELL-SWDs, 4 – 6 year ELLs, and long-term ELLs include leveled ESL textbooks, high 
interest-low level reading anthologies, and a differentiated independent reading library, including reference material. Students 
are providedwith social studies and science textbooks on different reading levels. They are also offered adapted versions of 
classic works of literature.Teachers of ELLs incorporate the use of computers and the internet in their daily lessons. Teachers 
make their power point presentationsavailable to students and students are informed of and required to use web-based 
science, social studies and math review sites. All of thesematerials are offered in English.  Accessiblility to dictionaries is 
provided to students at all times.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language is supported by second language department offerings in Spanish, including a Native Language class, and On-
line French.  Communications to families is translated into the home language.  Materials and resources pertaining to students' 
needs are also readily available.  These include dictionaries, glossaries, and examination s in home language.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Students are supported and preparedto meet the requirements for graduation through appropriate programming, 
coursework, and materials used in all classes. Students areprovided with tutoring in order to assist them in completing all 
course requirements and successfully passing all required state exams.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Instructional materials for newcomers, ELL-SWDs, 4 – 6 year ELLs, and long-term ELLs include leveled ESL textbooks, high 
interest-low level reading anthologies, and a differentiated independent reading library, including reference material. Students 
are providedwith social studies and science textbooks on different reading levels. They are also offered adapted versions of 
classic works of literature.Teachers of ELLs incorporate the use of computers and the internet in their daily lessons. Teachers 
make their power point presentationsavailable to students and students are informed of and required to use web-based 
science, social studies and math review sites. All of thesematerials are offered in English.  Accessiblility to dictionaries is 
provided to students at all times.

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 When students are accepted into the HS of Economics & Finance, they, along with their parents/guardians, are invited to 
attend an 
orientation at our school. During the orientation, ELLs are identified and translators are provided for them and their parents to 
ensure thatthey understand our program and their questions and concerns are addressed. Students and their 
parents/guardians receive a tour of theschool and an opportunity to meet with a counselor. All incoming students must 
complete a summer reading project and the reading listincludes books that are appropriate for ELLs. In addition, all incoming 
students, including ELLs, attend a four-week Moody’s SummerInstitute where they take English, business and math classes. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish and On-lineFrench. College courses in Second Language are also offered.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A  
 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional development is offered to all staff members (Assistant Principals, guidance counselors, all teachers, 
paraprofessionals, the parent coordinator and members of the School Based Support Team).  Some of the staff development 
workshops offered are: Working with ELL Students, CR154, Differentiating Instruction with ELL Students, and Information on 
LAB-R and NYSESLAT tests.  In addition, the staff has common planning time and inquiry time to further develop curriculum 
using ESL instructional strategies.  Our ESL teacher, Dr. King, attends the district professional developments. 
The ELL teacher takes part in all professional development Mondays.  The English /ESL Department has made its area of focus 
the new Common Core English exam and is planning and adapting instruction to meet these new requirements.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Teachers of SWD meet with the ELL teacher to share any information on the student that have an IEP. 
Monday afternoons teachers are scheduled for one hour of professional development.  Over the course of the school year, 
time is incorporated into the Professional Development to make sure the appropriate time is being addressed.  Attendance 
record, Agendas and professional development activities are reviewed, collected and stored in a PD binder located in the 
principal's office.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The guidance couneslor and assistant principal of pps meet with parents of ELLS at regular conferences at the beginning of the 
school year and as needed throughout the school year.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

In order to ensure parent involvement (including parents of ELLs) in our school, we have a full-time Parent Coordinator 
(Spanish 
bilingual) who is also a member of the Parent Association. All parents are invited to the New Student Orientation and to join 
the ParentAssociation. Parent meetings are held monthly at our school and are attended by staff members who can translate 
into Spanish and Chinese. Letters from the principal and Parent Association bulletins are mailed home to keep parents abreast 
of school activities. Parents are also invited to join the School Leadership Team.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Michael Stanzione, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
