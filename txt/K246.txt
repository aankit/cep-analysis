Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our Mission:  

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

Mission of Walt Whitman is that all students can attain success in a safe and nurturing environment given the right 
resources. It is our belief that utilizing a rigorous common core aligned curriculum, ongoing assessment, feedback 
towards academics, physical, social and emotional improvement along with parent-teacher collaboration; our 
students will be successful in school and in society.  

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Walt Whitman Middle School serves 467 students in grade six through eight. The school is located in the Flatbush 
section of Brooklyn with 95% of the population qualifying for free or reduced meals, which designates us as a Title I 
school.  

 

In addition, we strongly believe that learning does not take place in chaos and therefore the environment should 
promote high expectations and be conducive to learning. These practices align with our beliefs about how students 
learn best. Our school community promotes college and career readiness through immersion programs. These 
programs allow opportunities for students and their families to visit college campuses. We also provide multiple 
opportunities for parents to engage in advisory workshops to aid in the selection of high school, students also 
participate in advanced classes that provide high school credits. According to the 2016-2017 School Quality 
Snapshot/M.S., about 95% of parents expressed satisfaction with school administration and staff communicating and 
building trust with them. About 96% of parents expressed satisfaction with the effective school leadership. 

 

Academic Opportunities: 

Students in grade eight have the opportunity to earn high school credits in US History, Integrated Algebra, and Living 
Environment. Also, students in grade seven honors classes have the opportunity to take the grade eight science exam 
in their seven grade year. Students in grade seven honors classes receive two periods of Spanish per week, so they are 
better prepared to sit the Spanish proficiency exam in eighth grade. 

 

Extracurricular Activities: 
PSAL Sports: Basketball, Track, and Netball. CAMBA, our community based organization, provides homework help, 
basketball, dance, art, music, Zumba, animation. CAMBA also offers Adolescent Literacy Program (ALC) to help build 
literacy skills for students performing at level 2. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11 

 

The school’s accountability data indicate that M.S. 246 currently services 419 students; 21% are English Language 
Learners and 27% are students with IEPs. Based on NYS Math exam, we need to increase the math proficiency levels 
for all subgroups. Structured resources are in place to adapt the curricula so that all learners have access to rigorous

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

  

 

 

The element of the Framework of Great Schools in which M.S. 246 made the most progress over the past year is 
Strong Family Ties, Collaborative Teachers and Effective School leadership.  

 

During the 2016-17 School Year, M.S.246 underwent a Quality Review (Q.R.), resulting in an overall Proficient Rating, 
with majority of the indicators rated Proficient. However, indicator 1.2 was rated Developing.  

 

Another area of progress in which the school has experienced growth in the Framework for Great Schools element of 
Strong Family-Community Ties by offering parent workshops in collaboration with our Community- Based 
Organization (CBO), such as ESL classes for parents, and improved communication with parents through an increase in 
the number of parents attending PTA meetings and other parent workshop as well as logging into PupilPath to track 
student academic progress. Outreach efforts were evident during the school's reorganized work day on Tuesdays. 

 

We are a multicultural school and take time to celebrate the culture and academic achievements of all students 
through, student of the Month, Awards Night, and other ceremonial events. Special initiatives that we will continue to 
collaborate in are: National Training Network, Inc. (NTN) and Urban Advantage.

The continued areas of focus for this school year lay within the 5 elements of the Framework for Great Schools; s 
rigorous instruction. We acknowledge that a successful classroom requires a strong curriculum — aligned to the 
Common Core that challenges students, scaffolds their experience, is enlivened by teachers who are engaged with 
their craft and track students’ progress for purposes of regrouping as data is analyzed. CMP3 (Math) have been 
chosen as the curricula because of their alignment to the Common Core. To ensure that the level of rigor embedded 
in instruction challenges students and scaffold their experience, supervisors conduct frequent cycles of observation; 
providing timely and meaningful feedback to teachers. Instruction will focus on explicit instruction with literacy across 
content areas. Math teachers will provide explicit instruction that will help build conceptual understanding as they 
solve real-world problems.

Strength: 

According to the School Quality Guide, MS 246 strength lies in Student Achievement and building Strong Family-
Community Ties. The School’s 2016-2017 Quality Review Report highlighted the following indicators: QR 1.1; Ensuring 
an engaging, rigorous, coherent, curricula in all subjects and accessibility for all learners aligned to the Common Core 
Learning Standards. QR 2.1; Align assessment to curricula, use on-going assessments and grading practices, and analyze 
information on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at team and classroom levels. QR 3.4; 
Establish a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to students, staff, and families and provides 
supports to achieve those expectations. QR 4.2; Engage in structured professional collaborations on teams using inquiry 
approach that promotes shared leadership and focuses on improved student learning. According to the 2016-2017 
Quality Review, the school is Well Developed in indicator 1.4- Creating a Positive Learning Environment.

2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           16 

 

QR 1.2 - The Quality Review noted that there was inconsistency across classrooms, as it relates to differentiation, use of 
entry points, and student engagement. There is also a continued need for using a school-wide tracking system that will 
result in adjustments, as data is analyzed from the formative and summative assessments. 

Assessment data shows a weakness in Science with only 28% of students reaching levels 3 and 4 on the NYS science 
assessment resulting in the school not meeting AYP. Consequently, MS 246 will use Smart Science as a supplemental 
program to help students build content knowledge. Also, teachers will continue to engage in ongoing professional 
development (internal and external) and collaborative teacher team meetings to help strengthen their practice and 
pedagogy. 

 

In order to align with the concepts in D.T.S.D.E. Tenet 3, M.S. 246 will: 

 

 

  Ensure that teacher teams add rigor and relevance to their Common Core Learning standardized lesson and unit 
plans by aligning best practices, questioning strategies and creating formative and summative assessments that 
address the CCLS expectations for each course and that they and are being used in all classes to assure rigorous 
and coherent CCLS-aligned instruction. We will provide professional development opportunities that include 
systematic support for all teachers to create rigorous, relevant and coherent curricula for all sub-groups. 

  We will ensure that teachers use both quantitative and qualitative data to ensure CCLS alignment and access for 
a diverse range of learners and effectively monitor and revise pedagogical teaching strategies, including creating 
multiple entry points of access into classroom lessons. 

  We will utilize Teacher Teams to develop rich, integrated learning opportunities that embed the visual arts, 

technology and other enrichment areas to broaden student engagement, learning and reflection with 
corrective, purposeful feedback that leads to college and career readiness. 

  We will use common assessments regularly to determine student's progress towards goals set in order to make 

adjustments to support as needed. 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all teachers will utilize data driven instructional practices to strengthen the level of rigor, as evidenced by 
5% improvement of student performance on local and state assessments.

According to the 2016 to 2017 School Quality Review rating, the school is proficient in establishing a culture for learning 
that communicates high expectations to staff, students, and families, and provides supports to achieve those 
expectations. At MS 246 we identify, promote, and support the social and emotional development of all our students. 
We are currently revising our school-wide TAC-D to include systems and experiences that lead to healthy relationships 
and a safe, respectful environment that is conducive to learning for all students. 

According to NYSED IIT- DTSDE review, the school leader has allocated resources to support students’ social emotional 
development health (SEDH); all stakeholders are supporting the school – wide implementation of TAC-D & Support the 
systems that are in place to leverage resources to support improved attendance, behavior, and targeted student 
support. 

Our Priority Need area is to establish structures to support the use of data to respond to student academic as well as 
social and emotional developmental health needs. We will continue to use the school wide tracking system to identify

According to the 2016– 2017 Quality Review, our area of celebrations are Strong families, Collaborative Teachers and 
Effective School Leadership.  

 

Teachers use the Data Wise- Noticing and Wondering Protocol tool to look at student's work in an effort to improve 
teaching and learning. The protocol is also used during formal and informal observations and walk- through to identify 
strengths and provide actionable feedback towards teacher improvement. 

Teachers will continue to use data to differentiate instructional practices and ensure consistent student engagement in 
rigorous and high interest tasks for all learners in the classrooms 

 

Additional time has been allocated during the academic day for teacher teams to meet, plan and use data to modify the 
curriculum maps and create instructional groups in the classroom.

MS 246 sets high expectations for all. English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities have access to the 
curriculum and tasks, and are cognitively engaged. Across classrooms, teaching practices are aligned to the curricula and 
reflect an articulated set of beliefs about how students learn best. Teaching practices are informed by Charlotte 
Danielson’s Framework for Teaching and the Common Core instructional shifts. 

According to the 2016 to 2017 Quality Review, student work products and discussions in some classes reflect 
inconsistencies across classrooms in regards to tracking student's progress, differentiation and the availability of varying 
entry points for all students. 

 

Our Professional Learning Community time allows teachers from the same discipline to analyze student work using the 
analysis of student work protocols to identify strengths and learning gaps in an effort to revise and modify curricula and 
lesson plans. Teacher Teams will continue to analyze student assessment data to determine next steps for students at 
all levels. The teams will also use the data to inform and assess effectiveness of instruction. 

 

Our community partners will help bring in professional development workshops fostering research-based instructional 
practices that call for all students to construct meaning by interacting with other students using authentic content.

At M.S. 246 the focus is on the whole child. According to the 2018-2019 Middle School Quality Snapshot, M.S. 246 
continues to maintain a supportive environment for family, students and staff. Community resources will be strategically 
organized to support students and connect to the community, while supporting the core instructional program. We 
create a welcoming and engaging climate with strong relationships and communications between families and school 
staff. Upon entering the building, signs and directions are posted in English, Haitian Creole, Arabic and Spanish. The 
main office is located on the first floor. Once they arrive, they are greeted by a staff member that is willing to offer 
assistance. The Parent Coordinator is also a key person available in creating a welcoming environment for parents. 

 

To support families and their involvement in the school community, the school will do the following: 

● Create and implement high-impact family engagement strategies that drive student achievement and school 
improvement.

● Effectively engage the school community in school planning, budgeting, and plan implementation. 

● Create welcoming and inviting schools where all people feel welcome. 

● School leadership and parent and community leaders effectively partner and communicate. 

● Leverage community partnerships to enhance students learning and experiences. 

 

Along with our efforts, our Student in Temporary Housing program and our CBO's- C.A.M.B.A and C.H.A.M.P.S, will 
provide additional Community Outreach by doing the following: 

● Outreach and Enrollment Process which will involve parent information forums, individual family meetings and 
student orientations 

● Parent Engagement and Empowerment services - to target families in need of crisis intervention. 

● Home visits will be conducted; parent meetings will be planned with families on an as-needed basis; 

Staff members will collaborate with the Parent Coordinator and Attendance Supervisor on parent workshops and work 
to develop strategies encouraging greater family involvement in other school activities. 

Parents will be provided with a dedicated space in the form of a PTA room equipped with computers and phones to 
support PTA activities. Additionally, the PTA will have access to a dedicated room to hold parent meetings and 
workshops. 

 

In collaboration with Office of Adult, families will be offered adult learning opportunities in the form of English Language 
classes and additional parental workshops. These workshops will be provided based upon identified areas of need 
within the community. 

 

Families will be able to access and understand student data and progress through the implementation of Datacation's 
PupilPath program. This program provides parents with information regarding student progress. This program provides 
parents with information regarding student progress both academically and socially. Parents will be provided with 
training on how to access and understand Skedula/ PupilPath during school events.  

 

At the beginning of year there are events for families, such as incoming student/family orientation, welcome back to 
school celebration, Dads "Take your kids to School Day" that serve to welcome families into the M.S. 246 community. 
Other spaces such as Community School Forums will create opportunities for parents to meet one another and build 
community. 

Throughout the school year communication (e.g. flyers, robo-calls, letters) from the school to families will be in English, 
Arabic, Haitian Creole, French and Spanish to meet the language needs of the community.

Needs:  

While the school continues to make efforts to increase engagement, there is a need to improve strong family 
community ties and trust. Efforts to improve these areas will include: 

1) Conducting surveys to identify needs of families 

2) Building more transparency through shared decision- making at SLT meetings with agendas focused on developing 
and monitoring the school CEP, discussing budget and resource planning with shared space partners, and student 
progress. 

3) Staff outreach to parents on Tuesdays from 2:20-3:40 pm to discuss student social/emotional and academic progress.

Instructional Cabinet.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           47 

 

 

contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48 

 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. MS 246K, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 
Walt Whitman Middle School 246 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           50 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           51 

 

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,

o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.

Begin description here:            
To provide academic intervention services, Walt Whitman will implement an After School 
Program called My PACE. Our students will be  given the opportunity to stay in after school 
twice per week: Wednesday & Thursday from 3:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m. Beginning October, 2018 - 
April, 2019.   Instruction will be provided to ELLs and English-speaking 
immigrants academically, in English, in the areas of English and Math. The targeted population 
will be 80 students; including ELLs and English-speaking immigrants, in grades 6-8. Instruction 
will be provided by certified ENL and content area teachers. Teacher will maintains daily 
attendance during after school program.  
 
For the English curriculum we will be using "Rally Rehearsal ELA and "Getting Ready for 
NYSESLAT"  which will expose our English-speaking immigrants to content, academic 
language, and strategies to help them make meaning of texts. Also, students will be afforded 
regular opportunities to write about what they are learning using text evidence to support their 
thinking. The program uses high-interest, grade appropriate texts aligned to the  English 
Language Arts standards to help students build strong reading comprehension skills using a 
balance of informational and literary text from a wide range of genres.  The writing component 
will help meet the rigorous writing standards as our students learn to write  for diverse purposes 
(e.g., to inform, to persuade, to entertain). The students will write from sources that target all 
writing genres — opinion, informative/explanatory, and narrative. The gradual-release model 
guides students through every step of the writing process, so by the end of a lesson, students 
have the ability to produce a published piece. 
 
 
For supplemental Math instruction, we will use content materials from "National Teaching 
Network" (NTN) which targets and helps to build essential math skills aligned to NYS key focal 
points.  All key skills and concepts are embedded in lesson topics that have been carefully 
sequenced so students move from basic skills to more complex content.  NTN provides students 
with engaging  instruction and practice of each skill through highly interactive, scaffolded, and 
explicit instruction. Teachers will show a step-by-step process using the SOLVE method to help 
students dissect each problem while being exposed to content language. Teachers will also have 
integrated opportunities in every lesson to monitor student progress and check for understanding. 
The math component will help meet the more rigorous new common core math standards, 
teaching our students the  problem solving skills. The students will use procedural and 
conceptual understanding to solve real-world problems.

Begin description here:            
Professional learning will highlight the use of effective pedagogical practices along with 
ENL strategies embedded in all content areas.  Teachers of all grades, regardless of classroom 
assignments, which includes ELL and/or content area teachers, and specialists, are included in 
the Professional Learning sessions. Professional Learning sessions are conducted by, the 
principal, assistant principals, Peer Instructional Coaches, and other school staff who have 
attended off-site trainings. Representatives from the BFSC, the District Office, and DELLS will 
also be invited to conduct professional learning sessions when and where appropriate. 
 
Topics for professional learning include, but not limited to the topics such as: New Generation 
Learning Standards, Advanced Literacy, Effective Pedagogy, Culturally Responsive 
Education.  PL will occur during our reorganized work day on Mondays and some Tuesdays if 
necessary. Teachers will also be asked to attend out of building workshop throughout the school 
year of 2018-2019. The target audience: all teachers, coaches, guidance counselors, and 
administration.  Sign in sheets are maintained weekly during each PL session and is held in a 
binder by administration. 
 
Based on the results of the Spring 2018 city and state assessments, teachers will engage in 
professional learning activities around data analysis. Using trends from the data, teachers will 
explore research-based strategies to assist students in a deeper understanding of explaining 
problems and solutions step-by-step, orally and written; raise the level of thinking and provide 
multiple ways to solving problems. Teachers will be knowledgeable about the variety of ways to 
instruct and show a solution to math problems. Teachers will receive further information on 
rubrics in mathematics to assess students work.  Teachers will be able to modify and adjust 
lessons according to student work analysis using various protocols. 
 
Teachers will also engage in professional learning that will provide them with comprehension 
skills and strategies to incorporate in their lessons. Close reading strategies which is essential to 
incorporating the reading skills that will guide students reading strengths and abilities will also

Part C: Professional Development  
be explored.  Collaboratively, teachers will design lessons that teach students concepts such as: 
how to chunk texts in order to determine importance, understand text structures, make text 
connections, synthesize information across various passages and texts to form an opinion, 
formulate questions to gain a deeper understanding of literary and informational text, as well as 
analyzing and construct meaningful responses that satisfies the convention a of the English 
language. Teachers will also learn how to use UDL book builder to modify novels; allowing all 
students greater access to curriculum content. 
 
Teachers will use the EDAT tool to further analyze ENL data to gain a deeper understanding of 
how the data can be used to drive instruction. The data will provide teachers the opportunity to 
implement lessons that fosters engagement while developing language acquisition in reading, 
writing, speaking, and listening.  
 
All teachers will receive professional learning on embedding ENL strategies across the content 
areas. Research based scaffolding techniques that have proved effective for use with ELLs, such 
as think-alouds, graphic organizers, activating prior knowledge, cooperative grouping, and 
Think-Pair-Share, will be used as instructional tools to enhance teaching and learning.  

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

Begin description here:            
In order to keep our parents informed and engaged, we will provide two ENL workshops; one 
during the fall, and one during the spring.  Bi-Monthly workshops will be held for parents of 
English-speaking immigrants. Workshop topics will include, but not limited to ENL strategies, 
testing (NYSESLAT, ELA, Math), technology integration, and curriculum. Workshops 
will expose parents to what is expected of their child.  Presenters will make use of grade 
appropriate materials that will provide parents with hands-on activities that can be utilized at 
home. The information will include the organization and structure of each test by grade, what 
skills each modality will target, and types of questions. The ENL teachers will provide an array 
of home - school resources and strategies that parents can use at home to enhance academic 
learning and language development.   
Cultural celebrations will be held twice for the school year (fall, spring).  The celebrations serve 
as a platform for parents to share in the academic accomplishments of their child/children. 
Parents are welcome to take part in the learning process and encouraged to continue to support 
their child at home with the school's continued guidance. 
 
Translation and interpretation services are a daily practice here at Walt Whitman Middle School 
246. Correspondence for parent workshop along with other information for parents are sent home 
in the preferred language of the parents. We will continue to offer translation and interpretation 
services to help increase the involvement of the parents in our school. Translators are made 
available during the school day as well as during the four Parent teacher conferences. Documents

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Starting the 2018-2019 school year, MS 246  will use the Teacher's College writing Project (TCWP). This assessment is 
foundational and  evaluates students abilities to work through each stage of the writing process.  The TCWP assesses students 
reading comprehension, knowledge of academic vocabulary and identifies the student's lexile level. MS 246 will continue to 
use the DRP to assess the early literacy and writing skills of ELLs in our school. DRP results show ELL students lexile, 
independent and instructional reading level. This data is then used to  make instructional decisions such as; how to group 
students for tiered intervention, types of ELL professional development that might be useful for teachers (i.e Teaching

academic vocabulary to ELLs).  We will also continue to use the Fall and Spring NYC MOSL as assessments to plan 
differentiated, explicit instruction for each ENL student assessed.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

During the summer, teachers will be trained in the TCWP. Students will be programmed for four periods of writing and three 
periods of reading. The DRP and the NYC MOSL will be administered twice during the school year; once in the Fall and again in 
the Spring. After each assessment, teachers will analyze the data for strengths, weaknesses and areas in need of 
improvement. The data will also be used to identify implications for teaching and learning.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At Walt Whitman M.S. 246, the ENL students with proficiency levels of Transitioning and Expanding are administered the  NYC 
MOSL as a baseline to identify  progress and areas of need. The ENL students with proficiency levels of Entering and Emerging 
are given the ELL periodic Assessment in lieu of the NYC MOSL. The ELL periodic Assessment gives us a snapshot of the 
students listening, reading, and writing skills as new comers. 
 
 Success of the ENL program is evaluated based on the data reviewed from NYSESLAT to assess whether or not  ELLs made 
Adequate Yearly Progress. NYSESLAT data is also reviewed to ascertain the number of students that reached 
commanding/proficiency on the exam, or the number of students that showed growth across proficiency levels.  Also, ELA and 
Math exams are reviewed to examine the number of ELLs that scored a minimum of 2 on state exams given at the end of the 
year.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered and analyzed, the students are placed in three tiers (entering  with Emerging, 
Transitioning, and Expanding). Intervention services will be provided during and after school to address the needs of each Tier. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Success of the ELL program is evaluated based on the data reviewed from NYSESLAT to assess whether or not  ELLs made 
Adequate Yearly Progress. NYSESLAT data is also reviewed to ascertain the number of students that reached 
commanding/proficiency on the exam, or the number of students that showed growth across proficiency levels.  Also, ELA and 
Math exams are reviewed to examine the number of ELL's that scored a minimum of 2 on state exams given at the end of the 
year.    Data from the above assessments are also used to group students for  programs such as MyPACE (after-school)  and 
Skills Development (during school). During these programs, specific skills are strengthened based on what the data reveals. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Data findings are disseminated during weekly Teacher Team meetings and on Mondays during the reorganized work day. 
During these sessions,  the data is reviewed and teachers can make real time adjustments and modifications to curricula. 
Adjustments and modifications 'lives' in a Google- Docs document. All teachers are given  access and can make further 
adjustments when and where necessary. Additional resources are also available for use by teachers.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction for ELLs is delivered using standalone ENL via integrated ENL and Standalone ENL.  ENLs at the entering 
and emerging levels receive 180 minutes of Standalone ENL and 180 Integrated ENL for a total of 360 
minutes.  Transitioning, and expanding levels receive Integrated ENL for a total of 180 minutes, while, students at the 
commanding level only receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL provided by one ELA teacher and one ESL teacher in a 
content-area classroom.  ELL classes often travel together as a group. However, there are sessions when students are 
grouped based on poficiency levels; allowing students regardless of grade to be placed in one class.  At the eight 
grade level,  students are grouped heterogenously with mixed proficiency levels. Former ELLs receive integrated 
English Language in ELA via the coteaching model.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 MS 246 provides ENL instruction in accordance with CR part 154.  The mandated number of units support students in grades 6 
through 8 which consists of 360 minutes of ENL support each week for Entering and Emerging students and 360 minutes of 
ENL with 180 minutes of Standalone ENL and 180 of Integrated ENL. Transitioning and Expanding receive 180 minutes of 
integrated ENL. Students with commanding levels receive 90 minutes of integrated instruction in content subjects. To ensure 
ENL students receive their identified mandates, the school programs ELLs in two classes on each grade level. This allows the 
ENL teacher to provide mandated number of instructional minutes. Teachers are also programmed to ensure that they can 
cover the mandated number of instructional minutes in accordance with their contract.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Currently, instruction is provided through the EL curriculum for Language Arts instruction.  Additionally, Teacher's College 
Writing Project (TCWP) is to work through the stages of the writing process. Lessons are scaffolded for ELLs. The ENL teacher 
and the content area teachers use scaffolding strategies to make learning comprehensible for students.  ENL methodologies 
are used by teachers of ELLs. In addition, some native language support is provided to ELLs. The ENL program, has accumulated 
resource materials to address the academic needs of ELLs. Translation dictionaries and picture dictionaries are also used to

scaffold the content for our ELLs. Intervention support is also offered to our ELLs to help re-mediate deficient skills.   In the 
content areas native language support is also provided. Support is provided via word walls, glossaries, bilingual dictionaries, 
realia, visuals, graphic organizers, Total Physical Response (TPR) along with classroom libraries with leveled-age appropriate 
books are used to make instruction more accessible and comprehensible to all students.  The ENL teachers who are also fluent 
in the language of instruction, is able to provide native language support.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

To ensure that ENL students are appropriately evaluated in their native language, where and when possible, teachers provide 
translated versions of tasks and assignments. Additionally, when Spanish speaking students are enrolled, if they are eligible to 
take NYSITELL, they are also given Spanish Lab to assess their native language proficiency.  Also, during interview process, if 
student has interrupted formal education the NYSED Multilingual SIFE Screener (MLS) will be given to assess if student should 
be deemed SIFE,  Additionally, on state and city exams, where translations are allowed, students have the option to have exam 
booklet in their preferred language.  Translation dictionaries and glossaries are also available for use by students.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Differentiation of instruction occurs at different levels for subgroups with materials such as graphic organizers, sentence 
starters, vocabulary journals, iPads and other materials and resources materials to help student’s language development.  
a. For SIFE students, lessons are differentiated based on interest and ability. Instruction is provided at Tiers. SIFE students 
move through the tiers as they demonstrate the need for more targeted academic support.  
b.  Plan for Newcomers (0-3 years) 
b. For Newcomers, lessons are differentiated based on interest and ability. Instruction is provided at Tiers. Newcomers move 
through the tiers as they demonstrate the need for more targeted academic support.  Teachers are encouraged to select 
culturally sensitive materials and texts to support delivery of instruction. Teachers also spend time building /activating 
background knowledge to meet students where they are. Picture dictionaries and word to word glossaries are given.     
c.  Developing student receiving service 4 to 6 years. 
Differentiation of instruction for developing ENLs includes rigorous standards based instruction in the content areas via 
integrated ENL and Standalone ENL based on proficiency level, scaffolded instruction with home language support.   
d.  Differentiated instruction for Long Term Ells (7 or more years)  include the development of reading comprehension skills , 
vocabulary development,  and  the completion of standards based writing projects with the goal of these students becoming 
proficient in English to help them test out on NYSESLAT. Long term ELLs also move through the tiers (1, 2, 3) as they 
demonstrate the need for more targeted and intensive academic support. These students receive testing accommodation 
(extended time) on state and city assessments. 
e. Differentiated instruction for former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status include integrated ENL instruction in ELA or 
other content area.  Teachers spend time building background knowledge, developing reading and writing skills, helping 
students access strategies that promote their language development. Teachers also reinforce reading as a way of building 
language. Former ELLs receive 90minutes of integrated ENL in ELA or other content area . They also receive testing 
accommodation (extended time) on all state and city assessments.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The instructional strategies and grade level materials used by teachers of (ELL-SWDs) include; use of the Expeditionary 
Learning curriculum, TCWP curriculum, graphic organizers, differentiated instruction using scaffolding techniques, use of 
technology (iPads), to help foster engagement and comprehension.  Additionally, grade level materials are used for classroom 
instruction and to help prepare ENL students for NYSESLAT and other state-wide assessments.

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable diverse ELL-SWD to achieve their IEP goals and 
attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment. Through the use of ENL methodologies, differentiated 
instruction, modification based on students' IEP, ELL-SWD is given access to content in a manner that is manageable for 
them.   Additionally, SETSS teachers help to support ELL-SWD via Standalone services.  ELL-SWDs are placed in ICT based on the 
mandates outlined in their IEP.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA math and other content areas include:  
ELA 
In addition to ENL services, Newcomers, Developing, Long-Term ELLs, SWD and SIFE students receive English Language Arts 
Intervention built into their daily program. Tiered Intervention, MyPace ELL after-school program, and Skill Development 
periods are used to support ELL instruction for all subgroups.   Former ELLs and some ENL students with a proficiency level of 
expanding have access to Regents classes where they receive accelerated instruction in Social Studies. Former ELLs receive 
support via Tiered Intervention, My Pace after-school program, and some students are enrolled in Regents program where 
they also receive accelerated instruction.   
  
Math 
ELLs who are Newcomers, Developing, Long-Term ELLs, SWD, SIFE students receive Math Intervention built into their program. 
During double blocks, teachers use the first 20 minutes to provide remediation. Tiered Intervention and MyPace ELLs after-
school provide additional support for the ELLs.  Former ELLs receive support via Skills Development Periods for Math, MyPace 
after school program for Math and ELA. Former ELLs also have access to Regent’s content in Math and Science. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

For the upcoming year the Teachers College Writing Project will continue to help address the writing needs of students. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 
Lack of Funding along with no staff certified in Bilingual Education.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs  during the regular school day and after school.  All ELLs are placed in 
classes  (general and special education ) that are heterogeneously grouped . All students including the ELL population are 
invited to participate in all extended day programs provided by CBO's and  programs that are funded through grants. All ELLs 
have equal access to all programs offered at the school including regents classes.

In the freestanding ENL program at our school , Home language support is offered in Arabic, French, Spanish, and Haitian 
Creole with word to word glossaries/dictionaries.  We also have some language paraprofessionals who speak Spanish, Arabic 
and teachers who provide support in Haitian Creole. Bilingual books are also provided in Haitian Creole for additional support 
in classroom. Google Translate is also used to help provide language support when necessary.  There are also some picture 
dictionaries available in Haitian Creole and Spanish.

Professional learning will be on-going during the school year for all teachers . Teachers, pupil accounting secretary, and all 
service providers in the building will engage in Professional Development centered around ELLs and ENL services. Secretaries 
will attend PL provided by central office, the DELSS, and or the BFSC.  Service providers who are part time in the building will 
receive training from their agency and or the BFSC. Teachers will be engaged in Professional Learning Communities during the 
designated 80 minutes on Mondays. Topics will vary based on the needs of individual and groups of teachers. In school and out 
of school PD will include best practices using the EL curriculum, TCWP and the Danielson framework and instructional practices 
with the Common Core Curriculum.   Classroom support will be provided by school mentors. Teachers will engage in inter and 
intra -visitations to observe and promote best practices.  PL sessions will help support the implementation of methodologies 
proposed at training sessions.  Trainings will emphasize scaffolding as an instructional strategy and the integration of language 
and literacy in academic content, as well as looking at data.  The focus is on how to accelerate academic achievement and 
English language development for secondary English Language Learners. 
 
Professional learning offered through the school year includes supporting ELLs in the Common Core Curriculum and the 
different shifts.  Coaches and other staff attend various workshops to keep teachers aware of instructional changes to help 
staff address the needs of students.  The goal of our professional learning is to provide instructional support to our teachers in 
order to refine their pedagogical skills and improve student performance.  Our professional learning activities are designed to 
enhance our teachers’ ability to understand and use curricula, assessment measures and instructional strategies for LEP 
students.  
       
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The administration provides cultural awareness and sensitivity training for teachers to help them effectively communicate with 
ENL students and their families when needed.  We also provide support via translation to help ELLs navigate the high school 
application process as they transition form MS to HS. Notices for ENL students are sent home in English as well as their home 
language. The guidance counselor is an integral part of the transition process and receive professional learning from the BFSC 
and Dr. Vladimir on topics related to all students including ELLs. 
Teachers' of ELLs will continue to participate in professional learning offered by the district, DELLs, and other training as per 
DOE. Documentation of this training includes attendance, copies of certificates and  materials given to workshops. The ENL 
teacher an content area teachers will continue to engage in collaborative planning in order to enrich the quality of education 
for other ELLs.   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Building supervisors along with the ENL Coordinator , the LPT, and members of the translation team will coordinate to 
schedule and plan annual meetings with parents to to discuss goals, language development, and results of assessments in all 
content areas. Since Tuesdays (75minutes) are dedicated to parent outreach, meetings will be scheduled on Tuesdays so 
parents can meet with a cohort of teachers and or individual teachers. In an effort to accommodate all parents, meeting times 
will be staggered. Notification for meetings will be sent home in different languages. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70 

 

 

ELL parent involvement includes their attendance at PTA meetings, parent workshops, and other school functions offered 
during the school or after school. Twice per year we offer ELL specific workshops for parents of ENL students to familiarize 
them with the ELL mandates, the ENL testing and requirements of ELLs. School functions include, Back to school Orientation, 
community service activities , Medgar Evers Family Academy, and Awards celebrations. The parent coordinator works closely 
with the principal to ensure that all parent receive notifications and phone calls in their preferred language and that parents 
are provided accommodations based on their individual needs.  
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
At MS 246 all students including ELLs are involved in Club Hour. Club Hour is held every Friday during period eight. Students select 
the club of their choice and is engaged in an activity they enjoy. This allows students to work together in groups, solve problems 
together, as well as design and create various projects. Club Hour is another opportunity for ELL to develop social language as they 
interact with English-speaking peers.  We will continue to provide translation services to our parents and we also send home 
correspondents in the preferred language of the parents.

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility

choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Home language data is used to assess school's written translation needs. There is a large number of parents that 
speak Haitian Creole and Spanish. Information is readily available in those languages. Additionally, Members of 
the school's Translation Team along with the Parent Coordinator assist with translations for parents who speak a 
language other than English. When necessary, the Translation Interpretation Unit within the Department of 
Education is used to provide translation services. There are also Spanish & Arabic speaking paraprofessionals and 
staff to assist with translation needs. Parents who attend Parent Teacher Association meetings are asked to

  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

A welcome sign in multiple languages is posted at the main desk. Copies are also available in the main office. Once the 
parent signals the preferred language, we ensure that someone is available to translate. All school documents (i.e. 
calendar, letters, etc) are sent home in the parent's preferred language. 
All notifications and documents regarding translation and Interpretation can be found at 
http://intranet.nycboe.net/School Support/translation_and_interpretation_unit. This site will be made available to all 
staff and parents at the main entrance and in the main office. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Walt Whitman will put together a focused group of parents inclusive of all cultures and languages represented in the 
school to gather feedback and best practices on communicating with families. The parent coordinator will also be 
available to hear and respond to concerns of parents.
