Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

To engage in a rigorous arts curriculum that prepares students academically and socially for success in college, the 
world of work and develops their civic engagement at both the school and community level. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
In 2017-2018 we continued analyzing our data sources to determine areas of need and a focus to provide additional 
support for the teachers, parents and students. We collaborated and planned around our best practices to support 
the staff and to ensure the needs of all students are met. We devised six-week assessment intervals to inform 
decisions around instruction. Practical and meaningful professional development for the teachers was planned to 
improve our overall instructional approaches. 

The middle school continued to implement IReady and Ready (Diagnostic materials) material to support ELA and Math 
instruction supported by AIS Academic Intervention Support designed to deliver multiple entry points for the students 
and provide sources of data for the teachers via a technology platform. High school students are utilizing course 
materials from Engage NY, College and Career Readiness materials, Regents prep materials, CCLS aligned content 
specific text /trade books as well as teacher created units of study. We consistently survey the teachers to determine 
where additional support was necessary. This provided a focus for our professional development calendar for the year 
to ensure that teachers are consistently improving their practice and students are improving across the board. 

In structured professional teams, the focus was on improving Questioning and Discussion, Vocabulary, Accountable 
Talk, Cornell note taking and a systemic approach to writing, "Melcon". By consensus we continued to collaborate on 
the six- week assessment calendar providing time and strategic time frames to ensure that instruction was not 
interrupted and training for the teachers to analyze student data and understand the need for adjustments. These 
assessments were developed around student ability to master specific standards, how standards were introduced and 
or reviewed during lessons and what standards would be the focus for each six- week cycle within their pacing 
calendars. At the conclusion of every marking period, all teams engage in instructional modifications, analyzing 
student data and unit planning. Teachers are given multiple forms of data from STARS such as the Scholarship report 
and Regents Item Analysis report that continues to be discussed in Departmental and Grade Team meetings. Students 
engage in self - reflections on their work products and assessments results. This information then becomes part of the 
teacher binders and student folders for ongoing review and reflections to determine needed adjustments and or 
recommendations to units of study, instructional focus. 

In utilizing the Danielson’s Framework, we continue to deepen teachers’ capacity in utilizing data and student work to 
inform the delivery of high quality instruction to improve achievement of all students through providing teachers with 
timely and meaningful feedback cycles and actionable next steps. Feedback given to all teachers are housed in Google 
docs to aid administrators in determining support for teachers and or a reference to determine teacher growth. 
Teachers engaged vertically and horizontally in inter-visitations this year based on recommendations from 
administration and colleagues to get a better understanding of how specific strategies look in different classroom 
settings and to promote collaborative dialogue and coherence around pedagogy. Specifically with the ELA 
department, we partnered with LDC where teacher from grades 6-12 worked on vertical teaming that clarified the 
links from grade to grade. Additionally through conversation and collaboration, we decided that students learned best

days PD around questioning and discussion utilizing the services of LCI. We continue to employ the services of outside

personnel, CSD #13 staff and the Brooklyn Field Support Center to ensure teacher effectiveness via planned 
professional development.  

Careful planning and coordinating with the parent coordinator will be established to address students, families and 
staff concerns pertaining to reaching our goals and how parents can play a vital role within the process. In 2018 - 
2019, we will survey the parents on other strategic usage of the CASS system by initiating parent text through the 
system when students entered the building. Parents automatically received a text message letting them know what 
time their child arrives to school and will be able to receive a weekly or monthly report of student lateness upon 
request. In working on the culture of the building we maintained our programs such as PSAL (high school), CHAMPS. 
We have developed partnerships with our CBO's such as Brooklyn Community Services, Girl Be Heard, the Jeter 
Foundation( Leadership) the Teen Innovators Program with the Brooklyn Navy Yard, College Access for All (MS), 
Medgar Evers College Acces for All, and student leadership group SVC. All of the aforementioned programs provide a 
correlation between the school experience and what students can expect either in college or the world of work and 
social emotional learning. Students have opportunities to assume leadership roles. Other programs like Girl Be Heard, 
the BAM Internship Program,TDF and Cooper Hewitt gives students an artistic space to demonstrate their abilities. 
The Superior Sound Marching Band also provides students with numerous opportunities to demonstrate their musical 
skills and visit colleges where tours are provided. In utilizing all resources in the building, we partnered with Laurie 
Cumbo, Arts Connections/Warner Brothers Foundation to give student exposure to the recording industry and 
professionals by working with a resident in our state of the art recording facility that resulted in a culminating listen 
event and feedback session. 

We endeavor to expose students to college level courses while they are still in high school. In 2017 - 2018 via AP for 
All we implemented 4 AP courses; AP US History, AP English, AP Literature and AP Foreign Language. Additionally, in 
2018 - 2019 we added AP Environmental Science to ensure our students experience college level rigor. To remain true 
to college and careers our students continued to participate in the Teen Innovators Program which also builds on the 
literacy skills set required in a professional setting. Students are given opportunities to meet and interview Chief 
Executive Officers and Presidents of various firms within and outside of the Navy Yard. At the conclusion of the 
program, students are offered paid positions as interns in addition to becoming mentors of future Teen Innovators. 
There has been much effort put towards acquiring Chess in the Schools and the establishing of a competing Debate 
Team. We will continue to focus on providing quality services to all students including ELL’s, and SWD’s to insure 
academic growth and success. 

All Guidance counselors are assigned to specific grades and families are aware to whom they can address their 
concerns that require the expertise of such personnel. The Children are Reason Enough (CARE) team will re-examine 
procedures and protocol used to addresses students who are exhibiting personal and academic challenges and are 
charged with instituting an intervention plan which is monitored for adjustments over time. Attendance meetings are 
conducted bi-weekly with personalized letters and parent meetings to support students with chronic 
attendance/lateness problems. 

Knowing the issues around social media and bullying we will look to provide more support from our CSD#13 and BFSC 
support for staff and families to address bullying and cyber-bullying. These practices in the past have helped 
strengthened students’ social and emotional learning skills and put the focus back into the classroom. This will allow 
us to see a reduction in school-wide suspensions and infractions to the discipline code. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

ICT classes on each grade, the Special Ed population in the high school brings about a constant challenge of delivering 
mandated resources that are so desperately needed. Due to securing qualified special education teachers that are 
content specific that can be used in the high school has been quite a challenge. Numerous attempts are being made in 
2018-2019 to acquire such professionals via The New Teacher Finder, Human Resources, The Fellows program and 
coupled by the lack of funding has caused us to be innovative in servicing our students. It is clear that our efforts must

again attempt to secure qualified applicants to bring about additional support to our high school SWD population. 
Specifically, the data revealed in the high school math ICT classes that reveals a void that we must address if our 
students are to acquire the level of success expected.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Based on our collaborating on the PLC calendar for 2017-2018 the decision was made to continue to focus on our best 
practices to increase rigor in all aspects of instruction. The area that showed the most improvement was our 
improvements in small group Questioning & Discussion techniques. Wherein there is still much work to be done in 
establishing continuous and consistent coherence across all classrooms, we have shown the most improvement in this 
area. From observing teachers in the classroom, higher- level questioning was evident as well as other areas such as 
wait time in response to questions and questioning that promote higher order thinking. It was clear that strategies 
introduced in professional development were being implemented on varying levels. Teachers have become more 
knowledgeable of Bloom’s Taxonomy and the DOK Questioning protocol when designing questions as well as with the 
introduction to LCI’s methodology around questioning. Such thought out questions are evident in the Do Now section 
of the lessons as a means of reviewing prior standards and or Regents based questions. 

In 2018-2019 we will continue to focus on Questioning & Small group discussion as well as our other best practices to 
increase teacher capacity, collaboration, trust and promote more student-centered classrooms providing equity for all 
students. To aid in this initiative, we will continue to work on feedback obtained from our 2016-2017 Quality Review 
and PPO visits around indicator 1.2, 4.2, and 5.1. Additionally, we will undertake creating a database of questions by 
content for teachers to facilitate when horizontally planning units of study. To ensure full student participation in the 
classroom activities and to promote more accountability on the part of the student, we will continue our work on 
Accountable Talk, Small Group Discussion.

Melcon. For the staff, we took an intensive look at the feedback from our recent Quality Review and reflected on ways 
to improve in Indicator 1.2 as a school and in the individual classrooms, 4.2 and 5.1. Having focused on the above best 
practices, we will continue to fine tune our strategies, consistently look at our data and provide teachers with actionable 
next steps, and provide professional development in various ways to ensure coherence is mastered across the vast 
majority of the classrooms. As indicated in the Quality Review data, there were inconsistencies in pedagogical practices 
from classroom to classroom that should have provided evidence of higher-order thinking skills and the production of 
meaningful work products.  

We have a strong and committed staff with vast amounts of expertise relevant to content and application. As such 
teachers will be used to facilitate more workshops for other colleagues in the upcoming year in addition to a well - 
planned yearly Professional Learning Calendar. There are still expectations that we have for our Professional Learning 
community that we must continue to develop to ensure that teachers and students achieve high levels of success and 
that rigor is coherent across classrooms and across grades.

to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

 

 

PLC will continue to work towards establishing an efficient and 
productive Data community capable of using all forms of data 
to guide instruction, reflection and the interpretation of next 
steps. These would include student awareness of data and its 
implications on becoming a successful and accountable 
student. 

 

We will begin studies on Courageous Conversations around 
Race and its impact on student achievement and 
student/teacher relationships within the learning community. 

 

To increase rigor, we will work on planning of units/lesson to 
ensure goals are met using strategies gained from PD. 
Additionally, we will continue to perfect strategies to 
differentiate instruction, promote student self-reflections and 
promote good study skills. 

 

To ensure that classroom foster connections to all ethnic 
groups, we ill do a book study on the Culturally Responsive 
Classroom.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
We will examine all data as described in the goal and action plan to determine growth and in what areas that will 
clearly indicate the need for modifications by February 1, 2019. We will accomplish this goal by looking at regents 
results, teacher observation data, team meeting protocols, planning of lesson, school wide data reports that will 
include swds and ells. Most importantly this will be done collaboratively. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
During parent teacher conferences, conversations between parents and teachers will be intermittently monitored for 
quality control. Parent coordinator will accurately record the amount of parents that enter the building and report 
out to the staff. 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
5.2  The school leader establishes overarching systems and understandings of how to support and 

sustain student social and emotional developmental health and academic success. 

5.3  The school articulates and systematically promotes a vision for social and emotional 

developmental health that is aligned to a curriculum or program that provides learning 
experiences and a safe and healthy school environment for families, teachers, and students.  

5.4  All school stakeholders work together to develop a common understanding of the importance 

of their contributions in creating a school community that is safe, conducive to learning, and 
fostering of a sense of ownership for providing social and emotional developmental health 
supports tied to the school’s vision.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

In 2017 - 2018 after having worked off the data results from our 2016 - 2017 QR, we made adjustments to the master 
schedule to provide teachers consistent meeting times, protocol templates, action plans, monitor meetings and provide 
actionable feedback to promote coherence. For 2018 - 2019, our goal is to continue perfecting these structures. We will 
continue to focus on the lower third of our population and specific students that missed regents passing scores by 2-5 
points gathered from the Regents analysis report data. In the middle school students that performed 2-3 points away 
from meeting a specific performance level will be tracked by their grade and content teachers to ensure progress 
towards meeting acceptable performance standards. For a supportive environment teachers will be provided the 
necessary tools to address students needs by effectively using their student data to drive their instruction. 

We will continue to look at the impact of students’ social behaviors via the amount of OORS incidents, teacher 
anecdotals and devising methods to support the students through SEL and RFA curriculum. We will encourage more 
extra-curricular activities with guidelines and handbooks for students to promote more accountability and support, 
Student Government, monthly awards assemblies, National Honor Society for both High School and Middle School 
students as well as progress reports that occur every third week of each marking period for more student support. 
Through teachers collaborating and in dialogue with students, we find that our students are drawn to certain teachers

more than others and as a result, teachers have adopted/mentoring 3-5 students as a support initiative. We have 
consistently attempted tp build a culture in the building where there are no invisible children and no invisible staff. 

In 2018 - 2019 we will implement strategies are Restorative Justice to aid in promoting equity and fairness for all 
students as well as examine the impact of TAC_D (Technical Assistance Center for Disproportionality) to ensure students 
are in school and not caught up in the suspension cycle. It is for this reason that the building of relationships will be so 
crucial in understanding why students engage in certain behaviors and or Root causes.

As a “Focus” school we have be given access to certain programs and or initiatives as support throughout the process. 
Based on assessing some of the programs and their effectiveness, we will streamline and use only one of those 
sources. In 2018 - 2019 the school will continue to provide support to students and teachers by focusing on 
strengthening units of study and providing additional supports needed for English language learners. We will continue 
the use of software programs (Ready Diagnostic materials) to support independent work sessions in Math and ELA.  

The school will strategically set aside funding for intensified coursework, testing, assessments and the 
implementation of extended time and after-school programs. Further, students in need of recovery periods, 
participate in blended learning and extended day classes where some are utilizing technology based intervention such 
as ILearn, IReady and others with classroom teachers delivering instruction. Professional development will be 
provided to support the school’s ongoing instructional foci on our Best Practices using feedback and reflections to 
make adjustments moving forward. Administration will continue to adjust their schedules to align their work hours to 
the extended day schedules in order to lower the cost of per- session hours for work by administrators.  

Other programs used to provide support across content areas and across grade levels include: PSAL, CHAMPS, Girl Be 
Heard, Usher’s New Look Leadership Program, Newspaper Club, Teen Innovators, Software Engineering Program, 
Debate Team, Chess in the schools and Student Government, 100 Schools Initiative, Big Brother SEL initiative, Youth 
Advisory Counsel and Cheerleading. Per- session activities (dates and duration to be determined) throughout the year

student subgroups. Staff identifies student subgroups at content-area department and grade team level. 

In monitoring the parent initiatives, attention will be on the attendance of (PTA, Parent Academy, Family Night, 
Parent Teacher Conferences and Student Performances), log of parents that enter the building on a day-to-day basis 
and continue to survey parents to determine parent interests. 

Administrators and teacher teams will review the data from the Six-week assessment data, Scholarship report at the 
end of each marking period, review January Regents results, weekly progress reports from IReady, teacher-made 
assessments and MOSL results. All stakeholders will be engaged in weekly dialogue about student performance 
specifically addressing student growth, and areas requiring additional support while looking at student work 
products. Included in our data monitoring process, we will analyze the impact of student attendance, punctuality and 
behavior on student performance via the attendance and C.A.R.E. Team meetings.  

Our mid-point progress monitoring activities will begin on February 1, 2018. Upon reviewing the data from the mid- 
point benchmark, the collective decision will be made to determine adjustments and or modifications to the entire 
action plan or sections. In doing so, all information will be shared with all stakeholders so all will be knowledgeable of 
our current standings, adaptations and or modifications.

Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
To implement this plan, we will continue professional development around Advance and the Danielson’s Framework. 
Planning and scheduling of our professional learning calendar to ensure clarity of purpose and preparation to provide 
opportunities for peer-to-peer and group collaboration on planning. Provide teachers with adequate tools to engage 
in productive meetings around data, student work and teacher practice. Most importantly the establishment of 
cohesive collaborative unit(s). Invite parents to visit and or participate in the professional development sessions. 

Knowing the special education population consistently grows from year to year the teachers must receive the most 
up to date professional development around best practices to insure teacher development and collaboration with 
each department is consistent. Ensure that teachers have access to IEP's of students they teach to better provide 
entry points and differentiated learning strategies. 

In training, teachers often leave the building for outside workshops which puts a strain financially on the building in 
attempting to cover classes of absent teachers. Knowing how important the role of teacher preps play in planning, 
inter-visitations and or peer-to-peer collaborating, per-diem funding is a must to maintain standard operating

procedures and the consistency of instruction. Collaboration plays a key role in minimizing the interruption of 
instruction and therefore structures must be put into action.  

There is a constant need for access to vendors that will provide meaningful workshops for parents, training sessions, 
opportunities for parent to get together, parent incentives and awards. 

The school will strategically set aside funding for intensified coursework, testing, assessments and the 
implementation of extended time and after-school programs Further, students in need of recovery periods, 
participate in blended learning and extended day classes where some are utilizing technology based intervention such 
as ILearn, IReady and others with classroom teachers delivering instruction if per-session funding is available. 
Professional development is also provided to support the school’s ongoing instructional focus on what we consider to 
be our Best Practices. School leaders continue to adjust their schedules to align their work hours to the extended day 
schedules in order to lower the cost of per session hours for work by administrators. These strategic moves and 
decisions will allow the school to strategically allocate resources to fund a range of additional supports necessary for 
all students to succeed in producing high quality work and improvement of teacher practices, thus ensuring 
instructional goals and long- range plans are attained.”

NYC School Survey Measures a 3.80 showing a plus 4 percent as compared to the borough wide average. Encouraging 
parental involvement and increasing parent-school relationships through multiple avenues, including phone calls to 
parents, asking parents to attend PTA/school-based parent academy meetings, classroom visitations, volunteering and 
the involvement of the parent coordinator, teacher communications are all vital in establishing strong relationships to 
the community. To increase parent school relationships through collaborative use of technology via Teacher Ease, 
Remind.com and the standard meetings, emails, mailing, backpacking, and other sources. Our technology which affords 
parents an opportunity to communicate with teachers and to access immediate achievement information per individual 
class teachers is a need that we will continue to develop and monitoring over time for our desired goal. 

We must facilitate more awards programs to recognize parents for their support and during performances take the 
liberty to speak to all parents with updates which can happen during the day and evening 

Continue to focus around having more parents meeting with teachers on Tuesday as per the UFT contract and assessing 
parent needs as well as the student. Monitoring of this process and providing support for the staff on strategies to 
improve conversation between teachers and parents to the purpose improving student outcomes is evident.

Section 7: Support for Students in Temporary Housing (STH)  

 

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

 

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

 
 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

STH students, provisions are made to ensure that each student has an abundance of school supplies including 
uniforms and admission to various events that supplement their education. Guidance counselors are aware of the STH 
population for counseling purposes and the parent coordinator for the purpose of reaching out and assuring parents 
that we are there to support them and their children while engaging in the educational experience.  

Students are provided additional counseling where applicable to aid students in adjusting to changes in their life style 
whether socially or emotionally. Students are afforded the opportunity to express their concerns in a confidential and 
non-threatening manner. 

Teachers will be informed (confidentially) of who these students are so they too can have a better understanding of 
what the students are facing and what approaches they can take to assist the students effectively in the classroom 
and as a caring adult.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
BFSC, Teacher Finder and the excess pool will be considered in 2017-18 should the need arise. Our hiring committee 
of teachers is the first contact during interviewing to ensure that the proper chemistry for collaborative work is 
achieved. Final decisions are made by the administrative team after consulting with the hiring committee which also 
consist of feedback from the students that are engaged in the demo lesson. Specific designed questions are posed to 
the students for honest and responses. To retain our teachers, we ensure that all teachers continually receive high 
quality professional development around assessed needs, and feedback from observation and inter-visitations. This 
will allow teachers to continue to improve, contribute to the learning community and b e a catalyst for student 
growth. Teachers are given a voice and are empowered to be part of the decision- making process. We provide 
continuous surveys, along with feedback from observations to determine teacher strengths and challenges that play a 
very important role in designing professional development, consequently this provides us with a focus for our 
professional development cycles to ensure we address all needs. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and 
paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
To date all of our teachers are certified and over 95% are high qualified (Beds report). In a newly established 
relationship with Berkeley College, teachers will receive training and support to teach specific college courses at 
McKinney enabling student to take part in the college experience. Our teachers are involved in various aspects of 
professional support with Teacher’s College, Urban Advantage (Science Training), BFSC around ELA, Generation 
Ready, Software Engineering Program, Algebra For All, AP for All and our continued AVID strategies. 

Professional development is an ongoing process provided by the Administrators, Lead Teachers, CSD #13 and BFSC. In 
developing a culture of collaboration teachers are surveyed for strengths and weaknesses providing insight in 
planning our yearly professional development calendar. Our staff is regularly engaged in Lab-Sites, School Time Lab 
that focuses on College and Career Readiness and partnering with Brooklyn Navy Yard. All of the supportive 
professional development follows the same standards and guidelines for NYC and NYS. Our PD for staff consists of 
continuous and ongoing training for our systemic programs that support the common core initiatives across content 
areas.

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
During pd sessions teachers are surveyed at the beginning of the year during the time of June/August Regents and 
NYS ELA & Math Item analysis. tAt such time teachers provide feedback and reflections on their ability to analyze with 
efficiency and lesson and units of study. In working towards a culture of data, collaboratively we established protocols 
to examine assessment data from various sources including teacher made assessments, a six- week cycle of 
assessment around specific standards to determine instructional shifts for the next six- week cycle. Based on the 
needs of the students and teachers, we map out a series of workshops for both the middle school and high school 
staff to address teacher needs ranging from instructional strategies, inter-visitation feedback cycles. Such decisions 
require input and buy-in from all stakeholders to effectively yield the expected results towards achieving the school 
goals.

for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46 

 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 13K265, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Dr. Susan S. McKinney Secondary School of The Arts will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
N/A     
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           55 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Success of the ELL program at McKinney is measured by how well students integrate into the school community and success in 
meeting their academic goals as detdermined by ongoing assesments.  Students are held to the same high standards as their 
English speaking peers with the expectation that they will rise with support to meet and overcome challenges as they prepare 
for a successful future.  We plan to make sure students show growth in English language acquisition as reflected in improved 
test scores on ELA, Math, NYSESLAT and other yearly assessment.  Analysis of the NYSESLAT display students being strong in 
various areas but need continuous development in others. Our overall school focus for 2015-2016 should provide students 
with the necessary practice, remediation and assessments necessary for success.  Teachers will engage in more professional 
development to address the needs of the ELL population.. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Review of the NYSESLAT data shows that overall students' scored well in the speaking section of the exam across grades. One 
11th grade student scored well on the speaking, listening and reading sections but did not on the writing. One 10th grade 
students' overall level changed from Beginning to Intermediate while many of the other student levels remained constant. One 
9th grade student scored well on the Speaking, Listening and writing but fell short in the reading comprehension. Students 
showed an overall increase of 62% in combined total scores from the different modalities. One 11  th   grade moved from 
Advance in 2013 to Intermediate in 2014.       
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The Push-In model is the prefered mode of operation for ESL in both the middle and high school . The ESL teacher 
collaborates with content area teacher(s) to support student development.   Classes travel together by grade in the 
middle school and by sectins in the high school.  Within the classes students are grouped heterogeneously and other 
mandates.(SETSS, ICT).  This allows students the opportunity to learn with and from their peers in small group settings 
who are at different levels of language proficiency.  Students from the same language group are paired to allow for 
use of the native language for explicit explainations as needed.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A    

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           56 

 

 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

              ELA instruction is provided by a certified ELA teacher and students receive 8 to 10 periods of English weekly. The ESL 
teacher,schedules the ELLs for ESL instruction according to the state mandates:  360 min for Beginning and Intermediate Levels 
 in Middle School; 540 min in the High School; 360 min for Intermediate Level in High School and 180 min for Advanced Level 
in Middle and High School also 90 minute in HS and MS Proficient students.           
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
      Content area classes are taught in English. Students travel together as classes for English Language Arts, Math, Social 
Studies/History and Science. Teachers differentiate instruction for mixed-ability levels by using any number of differentiating 
techniques such as: Pre-assessing students informally to determine their level of understanding and ability to use academic 
language as well as familiarity with content specific ideas. Teachers make accommodations for various student needs by using 
reading buddies, graphic organizers study guides and online applications. When necessary teachers will provide students with 
additional texts to clarify the basic concepts of a lesson, and teachers provide opportunities for students to participate in 
problem solving activities that allow them to think critically and creatively. In alignment with Common Core students are 
encouraged in groups to participate in group discussion on a continuous basis in order to become proficient in speaking.       
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

      The content teachers as well as the ELL teacher will assess the students throughout the year in order to determine 
instructional modifications and or additional support the student may require. Inclusive  there will be online software 
applications that will provide the necessary diagnostics to reveal student current level of growth and or areas of additional 
support. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Students with interrupted formal education (SIFE) who require early literacy support will work through the Wilson Reading 
System to allow them the opportunity to build phonemic awareness. Independent reading allows them to progress with their 
English reading skills at their own pace through exposure to whole group instruction, independent reading of leveled books 
and computer based learning.  ESL instruction focuses on increasing student vocabulary for content area learning and use of 
academic language.  Writing instruction provides attention to grammar, spelling and composition through the writing process 
along with specifics modeled in the school-wide writing initiative.  Students receive the mandated number of minutes of ESL, 
based on their performance on the LAB-R and NYSESLAT exams. 
  
Newcomer ELLs in a English language school system less than 3 years are scheduled for mandated minutes of ESL.  Students 
participate in mainstream classes.  Lessons are tought incorporationg ESL strategies and differentiated instruction.  Standards-
based content lessons incorporating authentic literature and writing allow for the participation of all students.  Teachers pay 
attention to scaffolding learning in order to provide different entry points and supports for ELLs.  Bilingual glossaries are 
provided for use in classes and at home.  Students are provided with AIS outside of the regular school day schedule.

ELLs in  an English lanugage school for 4-6 years are scheduled for the New York State mandated minutes of ESL/ELA based on 
student proficiency levels.  Students participate in content area classes where teachers regulary infuse ESL strategies to 
differentiate instruction so that all students can participate while developing their English language skills.  Bilingual glossaries 
are provided for use in class and at home. Students are provided with AIS outside of the regular school day schedule. 
  
Long term ELLs receive the mandated number of minutes of ESL based on their performance on the yearly NYSESLAT 
exams.  ESL support focuses on increasing student use of academic language.  Reading focuses on phonological awareness, 
fluency and increasing comprehension and expression of ideas as complete thoughts when speaking and writing.  Students' 
prior experiences are used as a bases for making new connections in the curriculum. 
Former ELLs are provided with ongoing support by the ESL teacher as needed.  Students are encouraged to continue to use the 
bilingual dictionaries in school and at home. Former ELLs continue to get the test modification of time and a half on state 
exams for two years after testing out on the NYSESLAT. Students participate in AIS programs outside of the regular school day 
schedule.    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers of ELL-SWDs use grade-level materials and ESL Scaffolding strategies to support ELLs access to academic content and 
English language development. Some of the materials used include: New York Science by National Geographic; Prentice Hall 
Literature – Gilgamesh and A Doll’s house; Avencemos I; No Fear by Shakespeare; Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte; Common 
Core Code X by Scholastic. The technology component provides supplemental  group and individual learning experiences. All 
students have an ID and access to IReady and Rosetta Stone. 
Scaffolding strategies used include Bridging to activate students prior knowledge of topics and personal links to new topics as 
they are introduced. Schema building by use of advance organizers in preparation for new learning experiences also gives 
students the opportunity to connect and invest in learning new material.  To support ELLs language development new 
concepts and language are made clear by Contextualizing by use of realia, manipulatives, graphic representation and visual 
analogies that are familiar to the students.  Teachers provide Models of how to proceed to complete assignments as well as 
models of products by providing examples of end products.  The Text Re-presentation strategy gives students an opportunity 
to interact with and respond to listening and reading of complex texts by allowing them to transfer what they have learned 
into a different genre. Use of Rubrics allow for metacognitive planning and reflection on assignments.  
ELLs have equal access to all programs and materials available at the school that are both appropriate as well as offer them 
instructional challenge to strive forward.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our first approach is to insure that the IEP is well written and reflects the needs of the learner. Examine the goals and be 
assured that for the student the goals are attainable in a timely manner. Teachers are consistently engaged in looking at data 
from all students they teach to afford all students differentiated instruction and multiple entry points to instruction. At the 
beginning of the year, students are grouped strategically to insure that with current staffing, students are able to receive 
services to aid in their development. After careful review and parental meetings we provide parents with options (ICT / SETSS) 
in order to provide student the opportunity to demonstrate their learning.     
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Students of all levels are involved with MSQI and or Technology. Various teachers and Paraprofessionals are available to 
provide native language support in Spanish to students in literature and technology. 
Intervention programs are conducted in English. All ELL subgroups are involved in the intervention programs for ELA and Math. 
The MSQI literacy program is designed to improve reading across the content areas; increase stamina and improve close

reading of texts as well as increase academic vocabulary and writing. The Engage NY math initiative uses the Connected Math 
Program which allow progress based upon the needs of the child. IREADY is an interactive differentiated program that allows 
students to progress as they demonstrate mastery of concepts and skills as well as provide teachers with ongoing data to 
determine gaps, strengths nd areas of focus. 
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In the coming school year the Common Core Standards will be addressed via MSQI.  Students are provided with multiple entry 
points across content areas to learn and interact with academic vocabulary and writing initiatives.  They have opportunities to 
see the same vocabulary used in various subjects.  Students across content areas will be exposed to higher level questioning 
strategies to gauge student understanding and or ther lack of. Via use of the Depth of Knowledge wheel prompts students will 
be engaged in class debates, small group discussions increasing their communication and verbal skills.  To build student 
stamina, students will have increased time built into their schedules for reading independently. This enables teachers to 
conduct small group strategy lessons and to access students understanding by conferring with them. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Read 180 due to funding allocations not sufficient to maintain the program. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Extended day is offered to all students in the areas of Math and Science.  AIS services supports the targeted content areas 
during the day and in after school for both the MS and HS.  For the high school students also have preparation classes for both 
the regents and AP courses provided by staff. Students are alsom afforded the opportunioty t participate in testing similations 
to arrive at weaknesses and or strengths that serve as means for instructional modifications. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Grade-level materials and ESL Scaffolding strategies to support ELLs access to academic content and English language 
development include: New York Science by National Geographic; Prentice Hall Literature; Avencemos I; Common Core Code X 
by Scholastic. The technology component provides supplemental group and individual learning experiences. Technology  -All 
students have access to IReady, ILearn along with hands on learning of math concepts through Robotics. 
  
Materials that address content and language development of ELLs include Scott Foresman ESL (Grades 6, 7 + 8.); Step-By-Step 
Writing A Standards Based Approach Book 1; English is Fun An ESOL Program for Beginners; Getting Ready for NYSESLAT 
(6,7,8,9-12); and Very Easy True Stories. Students are provided with word to word glossaries for use in content area classes and 
to assist them during exams. 
  
Scaffolding strategies used include Bridging to activate students prior knowledge of topics and personal links to new topics as 
they are introduced. Schema building by use of advance organizers in preparation for new learning experiences also gives 
students the opportunity to connect and invest in learning new material.  To support ELLs language development new

into a different genre. Use of Rubrics allow for metacognitive planning and reflection on assignments.  
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is provided by use of student dictionarie,glossaries and various online applications. Students are 
paired with a same language partner when possible in classroom settings.

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All students are exposed to grade appropriate curriculum in the content areas classes.  Students are provided with a variety of 
learning strategies to allow access to the materials on their learning and language developmental levels. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Grade-level materials and ESL Scaffolding strategies to support ELLs access to academic content and English language 
development include: New York Science by National Geographic; Prentice Hall Literature; Avencemos I; Common Core Code X 
by Scholastic. The technology component provides supplemental group and individual learning experiences. Technology  -All

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ELLs are invited to Student Orientation sessions prior to the beginning of the school year. Parent Open House 
meetings are held during the school year. As new students come in during the school year they are also paired with a peer to 
help them acclimate to the new school environment. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Currently there are no electives that are offered to ELLs. However, in High school studennts are required to take 2 years of 
Spanish. This also give support to students learning the necessary grammar and approached to writing in Spanish native 
languages. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All teachers will be encouraged to attend professional development to better provide services to the ELL population. Teachers 
will be afforded the opportunity to obtain dual license and services provided bt TESOL. 
In working with the support of Brooklyn North, teachers will be sent to professional developmental series to acquire lastest 
best practices for working with ELLs in their specific content areas. In addition, thye will provide traing to the staff in support of 
the ELLs during Monday PD sessions. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Staff members are provided with the necessary language information regarding ELL students as they transition from one grade 
level to the next. This is accomplished via conferencing between content area teachers and the ESL teacher. As needed 
teachers conference and share plans to differentiate lessons for ELLs.  
Designated PD Mondays will be given to training teachers in the best practices around the ELL population. In addition to 
working with our BFSC we will send teachers for workshops they may provide to insure that the staff engages all ELLs in there 
lessons and in planning.    
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
All parents are invited to monthly Parent Academy meetings where there is also a segment devoted to instructional and 
program concerns. In arranging meetings, if we cannot address sufficiently the language of the parent we will secure a 
translator to insure that communication is clear and concise. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parent involvement at McKinney is an ongoing process that occurs throughout the year. Parents work with teachers and 
administrators to organize and run school activities by their participation on the School Leadership Team. All ELL parents are 
encourage to attend.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Michael Walker, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The Home Language Identification Survey, ATS information, parent responses to the letters requesting their 
language preferences and the ESL Teacher’s Interview with the parents/students are the means by which we 
determine the written translation and oral interpretation needs.
