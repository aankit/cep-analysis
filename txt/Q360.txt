Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

 

Vision  

PS 360Q is a place where student scholars strive for excellence academically, socially, and emotionally in a safe and 
supportive environment. All staff members will work in partnership with parents and the community to create an 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

environment where student scholars are empowered to discern strengths and achieve maximum success. High 
expectations will be the standard for all. Our school community shares the belief that all children can and will learn. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
PS 360Q is a school that opened in the fall of 2015. For the school year 2018-2019 PS 360Q will service grades PreK-3. 
A grade will be added through 2020 to provide public school education for Pre-K through 5 th grade students. We 
have 97% African American students, 3% Hispanic students.  

 

Our school has a certified Music teacher who brings with her a grant from "Music in the Brain" that teaches students 
how to play musical instruments. Our school has a certified Physical Education teacher who implements our Physical 
Education curriculum along with our Health curriculum. We have a Community Based Organization for our after-
school program, "Joe's Music" which not only provides homework help but also STEM activities. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

PS 360Q has students with IEPs mandating speech and occupational therapy. We have a Speech teacher who comes 
to the school four times a week to meet the students speech requirements. We have an Occupational Therapists who 
sees the students as per the mandates of their IEP. PS 360Q has students with IEPs who have an ICT designation who 
are in an ICT class. PS 360Q has students who have an IEP that mandate counseling. PS 360Q has a counselor who 
comes once a week to service those students. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our 2017-2018 School Quality Guide showed an increase in three of the six areas of school conditions and practices: 
Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative Teachers and Supportive Environment. The greatest increase was in 
Collaborative Teachers where the school's score increased from 4.75 to 4.99 an increase of +.24 points.  

 

The areas of focus are Effective Leadership, Strong Family- Community ties and Trust. Of the three listed the 
greatest increase was in Supportive Environment where the school's score increased from 4.81 to 4.99 a decrease 
of +.18 points.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
PS 360q is a school that opened in September 2015. Our school data showed an increase of 3 DRA levels for our 
student for the 2017-2018 school year. Assessments are administered three times a year: October, January and May. 

 

There are no long-term trends to assess or analyze based on State or School data. Therefore, our needs assessment is 
based on data gathered and averaged from district elementary schools such as Measure of Student Learning (MOSL) 
data as reported by the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) and the New York State Education 
Department (NYSED). 

An average of the MOSL results for local schools indicated on average 80% of all students are performing at levels 3 & 
4 which is a downward trend from Kindergarten to 3 rd grade. Also, the NYSED English Language Arts (ELA) results 
indicate a growing achievement gap between Caucasian students and students of color.  

Overall, the MOSL results indicate an average of 80. However, the Math results reveal a different trend than ELA. 
Kindergarten students who scored a 3 or 4 is around 92%. There is a dip in first grade to 81%. A plan to combat this 
drop will also be a part of our plan for incoming students.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

By June 2019, we will have a 5% increase of students across all grade levels who will be reading at proficient level as 
measured by the Developmental Reading Assessment Second Edition Plus (DRA2+).

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 360Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

PS 360Q will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community. 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
PS 360 will use the Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP [lower grade]) and the DRA and/or running records, 
by ELL Assessment Kit (upper grade to 5th) to assess students in grades K-5 in reading and literacy growth.  These assessments 
will be administered twice a year along with informal ongoing assessments such as IRAs (informal reading assessments) 
teacher observations, running records, conference notes, and unit assessments. All students, including ELLs , are assessed 
using the same tools. The results from these assessments will be used to drive instruction. From this data, teachers will be able 
to derive instructional foci, determine which reading strategies each child needs to work on, determine their independent and 
guided reading levels, and plan literacy lessons.  Also, teachers will be able to effectively differentiate instruction for each 
student.

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
In order to assess the success of our programs, we will employ many different assessment tools.  ENL teachers will assess ELLs 
throughout the school year.  ENL teachers will set group goals that are common core standards based and appropriate for the 
groups’ proficiency levels in reading, writing, listening, and speaking, as well as individual goals for each student based on 
writing evaluations, reading conferences, oral language assessments, and observations.  Teachers also will help students reach 
goals set in their classrooms through integrated programming. ENL teacher(s) assigned will work closely with classroom 
teachers in order to best support ELLs in their content studies.  In order to assess whether students have met their goals, 
teachers will look at student work, score writing pieces on a holistic rubric, evaluate oral language based on a holistic rubric, 
and refer to a reading strategy checklist.  All rubrics and checklists will come from the Rigby On Our Way to English 
program.  Instructional decisions will be based on goals set for each group, individual goals, and student performance on 
various assessments and general student work. 
ENL teachers assigned will also articulate frequently with classroom teachers about the progress and performance of ELLs in 
the mainstream classroom and content areas.  Teachers will share information, assessment data, conference notes, student 
work, and observations about students in order to best assess their needs and plan future instruction to meet the needs of 
ELLs.   
Based on the NYSESLAT we will also be able to evaluate the success of our ENL program.  A useful tool for us will be the AMAO 
estimator. We will analyze students’ test scores by looking at their performance on Listening & Speaking and Reading & 
Writing.  We will compare students’ scores with how they performed the year before, and determine whether or not they 
have made growth and improvements from year to year.  In our experience prior to opening PS360, many students reach 
proficiency in English in 3 years. Many students who do not move up in proficiency level over the course of 2 years are 
generally students who have been classified as students with special needs.   
Also, we will look at the ways in which students are performing well, and in what areas they need extra support. Support in all 
4 of the language modalities is important, but for this reason our program and instruction will provide extra support for 
students in the areas of reading and writing, while still promoting oral language development.  The ENL program will integrate 
balanced literacy components such as shared reading, read aloud, guided reading and reading strategies, small group support, 
guided writing, the use of graphic organizers, etc.  ENL teachers assigned will conference with students during independent 
reading and morning conferences as well as about their writing both in the classroom during integrated instruction and during 
the stand alone ENL periods.  
ENL teachers and classroom teachers will also use the strategies and techniques in the success criteria RL2 continuum to help 
build assessment capable learners.  Teachers will prepare students for the NYSESLAT exam with explicit test preparation and 
skills such as going back to the passage, answering various kinds of questions, and adding details to writing during the month 
prior to the exam.           
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
PS 360 will use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention framework.  Classroom teachers 
currently use various assessments to collect data on student performance in literacy and math.  Teachers utilize DRA, running 
records, teacher created assessments, observations, and reading and writing conferences to assess students' literacy skills and 
progress.  Based on the results of these assessments, students are provided with various literacy academic intervention 
services, such as individual and small group work with the teacher within the classroom, and small group push in and pull out 
literacy services provided by our academic intervention specialists in reading. Eventually, we also offer extended day services 
for students in small groups as well for children who are struggling with making progress in literacy. Teachers also use various 
classroom math assessments in order to assess children's math skills, primarily the math assessments used in our Go Math 
program, teacher created math skills assessments, and math problem solving exemplars. Based on the results of these 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

assessments, children in need of supplemental services to improve their math skills are provided with academic intervention 
services provided by our AIS specialists during the school day. Students may also work individually with the teacher or in small 
groups with similar needs during the regular school day with the teacher.  
Additionally, newcomer and beginner English Language Learners, as well as all ELLs who are literate in their first language, will 
be offered native language support to assist them in math and science. We provide children with the bilingual glossaries 
offered by the DOE and bilingual dictionaries in order to provide them with terminology in their native langauge in the content 
areas. 
Lastly, in the future children who score proficient on the NYSESLAT and are commanding ELLs will be provided with small 
group literacy AIS support as well as they transition to a general eduation classroom with the support of the ENL teacher for 2 
periods a week for a two year period after scoring commanding on the NYSESLAT.. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
PS 360Q is a new choice elementry school in district 29. There is no existing data. An analysis of Spring 2015 NYSESLAT data 
from neighboring school with a similar population showed [average] , Grade K, 4 (6%) scored entering, 9 (14%) scored 
emerging, 9 (14 %) scored transitioning, 33 (52%) scored expanding, and 8 (13%) scored commanding.  
  
The vast majority of entering & emerging ELLs were classified as newcomers (94%), the remaining 2 students at the emerging 
level who are developing ELLs are both students with disabilities.  Additionally, many of the children (80%) who were 
developing ELLs are children in Special Education.   
  
According to the NYSITELL scores for 2015-2016,  in kindergarten, 18 (21%)  scored entering, 10 (12%) scored emerging, 10 
(12%) scored transitioning,  16 (19%) scored expanding, and 32 (37%)  scored commanding.   
  
In all, neighboring school's with similar populations - total ELLs for the 2015-2016 school year,   14% of students in all grades 
are at the entering level, 14% are at the emerging level, 17% are at the transitioning level,  and 55% are at the expanding 
level.     
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           PS 360Q is a new school which opened in September, 2015. This program does not currently exist. In the future, 
commanding students will receive two 45 minute periods per week of integrated ENL service. Expanding students will receive 
four 45 minute periods of integrated ENL per week. Transitioning, emerging, and entering students will receive four periods of 
integrated ENL per week, as well as 4 periods of standalone ENL per week. Integrated ENL instruction will be delivered during 
Literacy Centers and Reader’s Workshop & Writer’s Workshop.  The ENL teacher will blend literacy skills, language 
development and content area instruction in both integrated and standalone ENL in order to support ELLs in their classroom 
studies as well as develop language skills.  Instruction and activities will be appropriate to the stages of language acquisition of 
the students.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   The ENL program will blend content area learning, language development, and balanced literacy while employing ENL 
strategies. ENL instruction will be directly informed by the grade’s curriculum, and by the common core standards. Literature 
will be at the center of language development exposing students to texts featuring academic language.  Reading books, 
discussing texts, writing and using various vocabulary will introduce students to academic language. ENL teachers will ensure 
that their language and literacy instruction in ENL are directly aligned and speak to the common core literacy standards for 
informational and narrative text, the oral language standards, and foundational skills standards appropriate for the grade and 
language level of students. ENL teachers will differentiate instruction according to the five stages of language acquisition and 
develop appropriate instructional activities to best support the ELLs and provide comprehensible input. 
  
ENL teachers will integrate science, social studies, and math into the curriculum to provide ELLs with needed scaffolding for 
success in the mainstream classroom.  The language support strategies that will be used for content area language learning are 
scaffolding, such as graphic organizers, modeling, extended time, hands on activities, song, vocabulary development activities, 
flash cards, and creating comprehensible input using visuals and gestures.  
  
Teachers will provide comprehensible input by using academic strategies and ENL methods such as activating and building 
background knowledge, graphic organizers, group work, illustrated vocabulary charts, photographs, bilingual libraries, use of 
video and other visual supports, gestures, vocabulary development activities, manipulatives, leveled books, multicultural 
books, bilingual and native language connections, and technological resources.   
Modifications to the classroom curriculum will also be made to meet the needs of ELLs.  Depending on their language level, 
teachers will develop alternative projects and activities that are relevant to the grade's curriculum, but adjusted to best meet 
the language needs of the students. Also, classroom teachers will receive professional development on and make use of the 
ENL strategies and methods above to make content comprehensible to ELLs. 
  
Though the Common Core State Standards are rigorous for ELLs, our focus on literacy instruction for all students through read 
aloud, guided reading, shared reading, and a concentrated effort to build higher order and critical thinking skills, coupled with 
the careful, considerate creation of comprehensible input, the use of rich materials, and the incorporation of the scaffolds and 
support listed above, will help all students to work towards or reach the expectations of the Common Core State Standards.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   ELLs whose native language is Spanish will be evaluated using the Spanish Language Assessment Battery (LAB).  This exam 
will be administered after the NYSITELL to ELLs entitled to bilingual and ENL services in order to determine a student's 
dominant language, as well as gain insight into their ability to read, write, speak, and understand Spanish.  The Spanish LAB will 
be administered by a Spanish speaking pedagogue.  Evaluation for children whose native language is a language other than 
Spanish takes a different form as there is no standardized native language initial assessment for students outside of a bilingual 
or dual language program.  Teachers will interview these students and their parents with the help of a translator in order to 
determine whether or not the child is literate in their native language.  New students who are literate in their native language 
will be encouraged to use their native language during certain activities in listening, speaking, reading and writing. Teachers 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

will utilize school staff when available in order to interpret and/or translate the student's work.  Teachers also conference with 
bilingual students after reading a bilingual book.  The teacher will evaluate the student's comprehension of the story and their 
use of strategies in the native language through conferencing, questioning, and accountable talk.  A child's literacy level in their 
native language will always be taken into account when working with English Language Learners, as their literacy level in the L1 
directly influences their ability to read in the target language. Bilingual materials and these assessment techniques will be 
available to students and conducted throughout the school year.                
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

At PS 360, Instruction will be differentiated for ELLs by grouping students by their grade, language proficiency levels and 
number of years the student has been receiving ENL services. Instruction will be further differentiated by “ELL 
subgroup”.  Different methods, materials, and activities will be used with newcomer ELLs, developing ELLs, long term ELLs, 
students with interrupted formal education, and former ELLs.  See explanations below. 
  
a.     There are currently no SIFE students in our school, but if we were to receive a SIFE student, ENL teachers assigned would 
first review the HLIS and interview the student to determine the home language and the amount of schooling the student has 
received.  If the HLIS indicates that there is an interruption in the child's schooling, the teacher would administer the SIFE 
questionnaire, and if necessary, after communicating with the classroom teacher, the LENS assessment. ENL teachers would 
communicate with the classroom teacher regarding the child’s performance in reading, writing and content areas.  Students 
who receive two years less instruction than their peers, are functioning two years below grade level, and may or may not be 
pre-literate in their native language would be given the ENL services they are entitled to.  Also the intervention team would 
determine additional services (resource room, reading support, AIS math, etc.) they may require.  The classroom teacher 
would be informed of academic strategies, accommodations and modifications that can be made in the classroom to help the 
student, such as whole group discussion, partner talk, use of video and other visuals to support content area learning, 
illustrated vocabulary charts, group work and graphic organizers.  Materials used are photographs, bilingual libraries, 
manipulatives, leveled books, and technological resources such as Imagine Learning, Brainpop.com and Smartboards. 
  
b.     There are currently no Newcomers. However, the plan for newcomer ELLs in our school is that they receive additional 
attention and support during and outside of scheduled ENL periods as well as in their classroom by using low-level, 
multicultural reading books, manipulatives, Singlish, language games, flashcards, photo libraries, hands on activities, Imagine 
learning and Brainpop.com.  Newcomers will be supported in their mainstream classroom by providing each grade with a 
modified curriculum map containing modifications for newcomers that support language development, such as picture books 
as their published pieces, increased usage of picture books as read alouds, realia, alphabet work, sentence starters, and 
graphic organizers.  
  
Considering the fact that NCLB now requires ELA testing for ELLs after one year, various programs will be in place to prepare 
newcomer students to take state exams in the future.  Newcomer ELLs could receive AIS and other intervention services in 
order to improve their reading skills.  Emphasis will be placed on literacy development in the ENL classroom during intergrated 
and standalone service, as well as the mainstream class through balanced literacy. ENL and classroom teachers will use 
strategies and instruction for language building support such as grammar-based lessons and activities, vocabulary building 
exercises, fluency building work and scaffolding strategies such as graphic organizers.  We are developing a curriculum that 
supports ELLs in academic areas and question types that will help to prepare them to take the NYSESLAT and ELA exams.  All 
ELLs will participate in ELA preparation in their mainstream classrooms as well.  ELLs will be familiarized with the test format as 
well as the expectations of the exam and passage types.  This work will prepare newcomer ELLs to take the state ELA exam. 
  
c.     The BESIS extension of services allows developing ELLS to remain in the ENL program.  Although we do not have any of 
these students at this time, future students requiring these services will receive ENL services during the Readers’s and Writer’s 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

workshops. Those developing ELLs that would be at the expanding level would receive integrated ENL service.  Small groups 
will ensure individual attention and support with ENL teachers focusing on reading, writing, academic language and linguistic 
development as well as cross-curricular instruction and support.  Struggling ELLs would receive additional services such as AIS 
in reading and math.  ENL and classroom teachers will articulate regularly exchanging ideas for language building support such 
as grammar-based lessons and activities, vocabulary building exercises, fluency building work and scaffolding strategies such 
as graphic organizers.  We will use leveled books, realia, content area resources such as maps and hands-on science activities, 
project based learning, photo libraries, technological resources such as video, Smartboards, websites such as Brainpop.com 
and Discovery Streaming, and using the internet for research. 
  
d.     We currently do not have long term ELLs who have completed 6 years of service.  If we had these students, they would be 
referred to the instructional team for review in order for them to receive services and support, such as, guided reading, 
extended day AIS, reading and math after school programs, Wilson Reading, linguistic support such as academic vocabulary 
building.  Materials used would be leveled books, realia, content area resources such as maps and hands on science activities, 
project based learning, photo libraries such as video, Smartboards, websites such as Brainpop.com and Discovery Streaming, 
and usage of the internet as a resource for learning and research. 
  
e. For ELLs reaching commanding on the NYSESLAT we will provide continuing transitional support for 2 years. As per NYS law, 
all commanding ELLs will receive testing accommodations (extended time, separate location, a 3rd reading of listening 
passages, and bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, and native language exams) for 2 years after scoring commanding on the 
NYSESLAT exam.  Additionally, commanding ELLs will be provided with both 2 periods per week of integrated ENL support from 
a licensed ENL teacher, as well as small group AIS support in various content areas such as reading, writing, math, and science 
if necessary.  Students will receive this AIS extra support during various designated times during the day.  The intervention 
team will monitor how these students are progressing and whether the intervention services are appropriate for them.  The 
inquiry team will work with groups of struggling students on using and reading non-fiction texts, some of which are proficient 
ELLs.  All teachers as well as support service providers will be made aware of who the commanding ELLs are in their classrooms 
and groups.  Classroom teachers will also receive support in working with commanding ELLs, are informed of academic 
strategies and modifications that can be used and made in the classroom with commanding ELLs and continue to use ENL 
methodologies and strategies in their instruction.              
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELL-SWDs are and will be provided with access to academic content areas and language development through a variety of 
instructional strategies and materials. The needs of these students will be accommodated by including smaller group size, the 
presence of a paraprofessional during ENL periods, specialized modifications and scaffolding materials like graphic organizers, 
partner work, technological resources, project-based learning and visual support.  Materials used will be photo libraries for 
visuals, hands on materials, games for learning, leveled books, maps, globes, and other social studies hands on and visual 
resources, science related materials such as hands-on experiments, realia, etc., technological resources such as Smart boards, 
websites like braipop.com and using the internet for learning and research.  These instructional strategies and materials will 
provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development.  ENL and classroom teachers will 
collaborate with Special Education teachers to address students’ special needs according to their IEPs. Teachers will implement 
these strategies during both integrated and standalone instruction.      
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In the future, ELL-SWDs will be placed in less restrictive environments such as a General Education Class with SETTSS and 
Related Services, or a Collaborative Team Teaching Classroom (ICT OR CTT).  We we will use curricular, instructional, and 
scheduling flexibility in order to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs.  Our school is and will be using creative and flexible 
scheduling in order to provide all students with the least restrictive environment for learning.  Students in CTT classes will also 
receiving small group pull out SETTSS for individualized instruction.  In this way, children are educated in the most integrated 
and inclusive programs while still meeting each child's special needs.  Additionally,  ENL, General Education, Special Education, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

and related services (Speech, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Guidance Counseling, etc.) teachers work together in 
order to devise a schedule that is free of time conflicts and allows the child to receive all of the services that they are entitled 
to as per their IEPs.  ENL Teachers work closely with classroom and special education teachers in order to best meet the grade 
level curricular expectations and standards for students for both integrated and standalone instruction. All teachers have 
access to a child’s IEP (either in hard copy or through SESIS [all teachers have been trainted in accessing student’s profiles and 
IEPs through SESIS]). Teachers are aware of children’s IEP goals, and work together towards helping students reach those 
goals. Teachers consult with each other on methods, strategies, and materials in order to help ELL-SWDs within all of their 
content areas.  The special education liaison/SETTSS/IEP teachers, and CTT/ICT special education teachers have also provided 
resources, materials, and training to classroom and ENL teachers on modifications, practices, and techniques that they have 
found to effectively reach all of their special needs students, including ELLS-SWDs.  Modifications are made with language level 
and learning capabilties in mind such as alternative assignments and grade and language level appropriate projects. 
Instructional strategies and materials are as follows: smaller group size, the presence of a bilingual paraprofessional, 
specialized modifications and scaffolding materials like graphic organizers, partner work, technological resources, project-
based learning and visual support.  Materials used are photo libraries for visuals, hands on materials, games for learning, 
leveled books, maps, globes, and other social studies hands on and visual resources, science related materials such as hands-
on experiments, realia, etc., technological resources such as Smart boards, websites like braipop.com and Discovery Streaming 
and using the internet for learning and research.  All materials are grade level curriculum appropriate.                    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Academic Intervention Services (AIS) 
The intervention team reviews struggling students, including ELLs, and identifies those that are at risk for not meeting grade 
standards. In the future, specialists on the team (such as an ENL Teacher, Resource Room teacher and AIS providers) suggest 
methods and strategies for meeting the needs of struggling students in the classroom.  These students will receive Academic 
Intervention Services as needed. AIS services are available in math, reading, and writing. ELLs in all subgroups are entitled to 
receive services, including newcomer ELLs, developing ELLs, long term ELLs, former ELLs, ELL-SWDs, and SIFE students.  AIS 
teachers employ various instructional strategies to ensure that they meet the needs of students at all proficiency levels.  AIS 
groups are kept small and use individualized instruction.  In some cases, instruction is one-to-one.  Students receive this small 
group instruction during various times of the day and during the extended day period. 
  
Newcomer ELLs:   
In addition to the AIS services available to all students in need, specific interventions will also be put in place for newcomer 
ELLs.  Beginner and newcomer ELLs will participate in the "Language Leader" program wherein they will be paired up with 
children in their class who will help to support their linguistic, academic and social development. 
   
Developing ELLs: 
In addition to the AIS services available to all students in need, specific intervention strategies will be put into place for 
developing ELLs.  Our intervention team will work with small groups of struggling students.  In the clasroom, teachers will use 
strategies with developing ELLs such as grammar based lessons and activities, vocabulary building exercises, fluency building 
work, and scaffolding such as graphic organizers.  Materials and strategies used for these ELLs will be leveled books, realia, 
content area resources such as maps and hands-on science activities, project based learning, photo libraries and technological 
resources such as video, smart boards, websites such as brainpop.com, and using the internet as a resource for learning and 
research.   
Long-Term ELLs:  
PS 360 does not currently have long-term ELLs, but if we were to have these students in the program we would use the 
following interventions: They would receive guided reading,  AIS, after school programs, Wilson Reading, and linguistic support 
such as academic vocabulary building.  Materials used for these ELLs are leveled books, realia, content area resources such as 
maps, project based learning, photo libraries, and technological resources such as video, smart boards, websites, and using the 
internet for research. 
Former ELLs: Former ELLs will receive 2 periods per week of integrated ENL services with an ENL teacher assigned. Teachers 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

will see students in small groups and provide support in reading, writing, content areas and linguistic development. Former 
ELLs may also receive guided reading, AIS services, be invited to attend various after school programs.  Materials used for 
these services will be leveled books, realia, content area resources such as maps and hands on materials, project based 
learning, translated materials, and technological resources such as video, smart boards, document cameras, websites, and 
using the internet for research. 
ELLs in Special Education:  
Interventions for ELLs identified as having special needs will be as follows: Small group instruction, the presence of bilingual 
paraprofessionals during all class periods (including during integrated and standalone ENL), specialized modifications such as 
scaffolding materials like graphic organizers, partner work, technological resources, project based learning, and visual 
support.  Materials we will use include photo libraries and other visual support, leveled books, hands-on materials, graphic 
organizers, games for learning, technological resources, etc.  The resource room teacher will utilizes the Wilson Reading 
program and include some ELLs who have been identified as having special needs. ENL and classroom teachers will familiarize 
themselves with the student’s IEP.  Classroom and ENL teachers will consult with special education teachers in order to best be 
prepared to meet their needs.  Students will receive related services based on their IEPs such as speech, resource room, 
occupational therapy, etc.  Students will also receive appropriate testing modifications and alternate assessment if necessary.   
Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE):  
PS 360 does not currently have any ELLs who have been identified as SIFE.  If we were to have SIFE students, we would use the 
following interventions strategies: AIS math, reading and science, resource room if necessary, Saturday Academy, and 
additional academic strategies, accommodations, and modifications that can be made in the classroom such as using graphic 
organizers, visual support, hands on activities, illustrated vocabulary charts, group and partner work, group discussion, 
bilingual libraries, technological resources, leveled books, etc.   
Description of reading and math intervention services: 
Academic Intervention Services will be provided for those students (including ELLs) who received a 1 or 2 on the ELA and Math 
state tests from the previous year and/or a recommendation based on a teacher’s observation and classroom 
assessments.  These services would include but not limited to: small group instruction based on the data from the DRAs, IRAs, 
ELA and Math predictives, math ITAs, math unit assessments, end of the year math assessments, conferences, and reading 
levels.  Students will be grouped within their classroom and meet with an AIS provider generally 3 times per week.  AIS 
teachers will work closely with the classroom teacher to determine the specific goals needed for each student. AIS providers 
will have access to the results of student’s assessments and may change groups or goals based on current data.  Common 
strategies found in reading include retelling, main idea, character feelings/traits, questioning, author’s purpose, and the big 
idea.  These strategies will be modeled through guided reading.  Common strategies in math will include problem solving, 
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of whole numbers, decimals and fractions, telling time, finding the perimeter 
and area of different shapes and measurement.              
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We have adapted our ENL curriculum to align to the new NYS Common Core Standards and the new CR Part 154 regulations. 
We are maintaining our curriculum which integrates language, literacy, and content areas, and are enhancing it with a stronger 
focus on literacy development, a greater presence of balanced literacy practices, particularly in the areas of read aloud, shared 
reading, and guided reading, and the integration of more rigorous higher-order and critical thinking development in both 
integrated and stanadlone ENL classes. ENL teachers assigned will  closely consult with classroom teachers in order to be 
aware of student needs, and work towards helping ELLs to reach the high demands of the common core 
standards.  Additionally, according to CR Part 154 mandates, teachers will conduct both integrated and standalone ENL 
instruction.  Teachers will provide integrated ENL instruction to ELLs in all grades, at all proficiency levels during the literacy 
block, and will provide standalone ENL instuction to ELLs at the entering, emerging, and transitioning levels during other times 
throughout the school day.   
  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 
Unfortunately, PS 360 does not have an extended day program.    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

ELLs will be included in all school programs.  ELLs will be invited to participate in the KJK after school program, chorus, band, 
Language Leaders, Student Government, Enrichment, and Tech Club.  Invitations will be sent home to families either 
translated, or accompanied by a notice that states in many languages that this letter is important and should be 
translated.  For programs such as enrichment, chorus, Language Leaders, and Tech Club, students will be selected by teachers, 
but if they fit the program’s criteria ELLs may be invited to participate.   
When ELLs participate in special programs, modifications such as visuals, translation, hands on activities, bilingual materials, 
building and activating background knowledge, etc. will be used to help them to fully participate in, enjoy, and get the most 
out of the program. 
  
In addition to special, extra curricular activities, ELLs will be provided access to and support from all AIS services in the building. 
  
Our school also offers an after school KJK Scholars program.  The program is open to all students, including ELLs, and 
acceptance is open to all.  The KJK program is 5 days a week for 3.5 hours a day.  It runs from September through June.  The 
KJK program offers snack to the children, followed by grouping. The groups are broken up into activities, led by “activity 
specialists”.  Each activity is accompanied by a read aloud related to the day’s exercise.  The activities include gym, dance, 
music, journalism, gardening, and drama.  For the last hour of the program, the “activity specialists” assist children with their 
homework.   
     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We will use many different materials both in the standalone and integrated ENL programs, and in mainstream classrooms to 
meet the needs of ELLs.   
ENL teachers will primarily use high quality children's literature and informational texts in the ENL program. Teachers will 
develop units of study around children's books, also incorporating magazines, articles, short stories, folktales, fables, videos, 
pictures, etc. 
  
Additionally, we will use other materials to supplement our studies. Some of these supplemental materials will include the 
Rigby On Our Way to English series as well as Rigby guided reading books and some Into English materials with all subgroups of 
ELLs within the integrated and standalone ENL programs.  On Our Way to English will provide students with exposure to oral 
language and literacy development, comprehensible input and standards based content area information.  The entire 
curriculum is aligned with each grade represented (K-5).  Materials and units will be organized into content area themes.  The 
units feature many different methods of teaching such as chants, songs, and language games as well as shared reading, guided 
reading, independent writing, hands on materials, and content area activities.  The materials are also multicultural and will 
help to connect ELLs prior knowledge with new learning.  Classroom teachers will also use Rigby On Our Way to English guided 
reading books.  We have an ENL classroom library, multicultural literature, bilingual libraries, fiction and non-fiction big books, 
picture and bilingual dictionaries, and magazines & other authentic texts.  These materials will be used with newcomer ELLs, 
developing ELLs, as well as ELLs in special education.  We will also utilize online reading resources such as RAZ Kids and Go 
Math.   
  
Many visuals will be used to support language learning, such as photographs, drawings, and video clips.  Visual materials are 
helpful to all ELLs at each stage of language development.   
Centers will be used both in the classroom as well as in the ESL program to help students develop language, with different 
centers for different subgroups of ELLs.  Listening centers on different levels will be used for all subgroups, vocabulary centers 
and will be differentiated to help newcomer ELLs develop basic vocabulary, and more complex academic vocabulary centers 
will be used for more advanced ELLs.  Centers with content area enforcement will be available at different levels for newcomer 
ELLs, more advanced ELLs, and ELLs in special education.   
A variety of graphic organizers will be used to assist ELLs at all stages and proficiency in various kinds and different levels of 
writing.  Charts made both by the teacher and with the class will be hung around the room to support students during lessons 
and independent work.   
The use of manipulatives, songs, poems & rhythm and TPR are useful for all ELLs as well as hands-on activities and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

technological resources.   
In the classroom, supplemental materials such as flashcards, manipulatives and math games will be used to help struggling 
students at all proficiency levels in mathematics.   
The science teacher will also offer support to all ELLs using hands-on activities, manipulatives, flash cards, assistance in 
experimentation, and vocabulary development activities and reinforcement. 
PS 360 also recognizes the importance of technology in education, especially for ELLs at all proficiency levels.  Every classroom 
is equipped with a Permethian board, a class set of laptops, and shared document cameras.  Permethian boards are used for 
interactive learning, and also facilitate the use of video in instruction.  The combination of visual and interactive learning is 
very powerful for all ELL students. Both ENL and classroom teachers will utilize a variety of websites that facilitate language 
and literacy development for ELLs at all proficiency levels, such as Razkids and Reading A-Z, that offer leveled texts, 
brainpop.com which has content area videos on different topics and levels, and starfall.com, a phonics and basic literacy 
program for young and newcomer ELLs and students in special education.  Lastly, the ENL classrooms will be equipped with 
ipads loaded with educational apps that help students build language and literacy skills in an exciting, engaging, interactive 
way. 
       
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Classroom and ENL teachers will allow students to make use of their native language in order to capitalize on their language 
abilities and natural strengths.  Students will have access to a bilingual lending library that they can browse while in school or 
bring home to read or share with parents. We also use bilingual flashcards, games, and an online library with bilingual e-
books.  Beginner ELLs will also be encouraged to speak and write in their native language, which enables them to be active 
participants in class.  The “Language Leader” program will provide beginner ELLs with a “bilingual buddy” to provide translation 
of some academic information and instructions to the student in his/her native language.  Teachers will sometimes encourage 
students to discuss books in the native language, and will often ask children to share vocabulary from their native language 
with the class.  Students who are literate in their native language will be given state exams in both English and their native 
language.  They will also be provided with translated glossaries and bilingual word-to-word dictionaries for additional support 
during the school day, on homework, and on in class assessments and state exams. 
Various people in the ENL program will support ELLs.  In addition to the certified ENL teacher assigned, some ELLs in special 
education will also be supported by bilingual paraprofessionals. These paraprofessionals will provide support to these ELLs 
during mini-lessons, group work, independent work, and share time.  They will provide both English language and translation, 
interpretation, and native language support when needed.  These paraprofessionals will also provide help in communicating 
with these children’s parents when necessary. 
       
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Support services and resources will correspond to students age and grade level when possible. In order to ensure materials are 
appropriate, we will utilize grade level content area texts written on a lower, more appropriate reading level for ELLs, texts on 
identical topics that are written and available on different reading levels, high-interest/low-readability texts, and 
leveled/graded guided reading books.  In order to ensure that instruction is grade appropriate, teachers will modify their grade 
level lessons to meet the language, academic, and social needs of ELLs.  Classroom and ENL teachers will work together to 
develop modified curriculum maps for ELLs that offer activities and projects that are aligned with grade standards and 
curriculum that are on an appropriate language level for their ELLs.  Teachers will also modify grade level material to meet the 
needs of students.  For example, a teacher may show a grade appropriate video, but play it on mute and narrate the video 
themselves in order to ensure that the input is comprehensible to their ELL students.   
Academic intervention services will also be modified to be age, grade, and linguistically appropriate for ELLs.  Children will 
participate in small group AIS services with other students on the grade, and instruction will be differentiated to meet each 
child’s needs.    
For standalone ENL teachers will group students both by grade and by level. Most groups will be formed according to the 
grade and language level, while some are mixed grade.  For integrated ENL, students will be serviced by grade, and we will 
employ flexible grouping (heterogeneous and homogeneous) by proficiency level in order to best meet both the mandates and 
the academic and linguistic needs of our students. Instruction in each program model will be aligned with children’s age, state 
and grade standards, and language proficiency level.   Further, goals will be set for both groups and individual students based 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

on their academic and linguistic needs.  
                 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We will use many different materials both in the standalone and integrated ENL programs, and in mainstream classrooms to 
meet the needs of ELLs.   
ENL teachers will primarily use high quality children's literature and informational texts in the ENL program. Teachers will 
develop units of study around children's books, also incorporating magazines, articles, short stories, folktales, fables, videos, 
pictures, etc. 
  
Additionally, we will use other materials to supplement our studies.  On Our Way to English will provide students with 
exposure to oral language and literacy development, comprehensible input and standards based content area 
information.  The entire curriculum is aligned with each grade represented (K-5).  Materials and units will be organized into 
content area themes.  The units feature many different methods of teaching such as chants, songs, and language games as well 
as shared reading, guided reading, independent writing, hands on materials, and content area activities.  The materials are also 
multicultural and will help to connect ELLs prior knowledge with new learning.  On Our Way to English guided reading 
books.  We have an ENL classroom library, multicultural literature, bilingual libraries, fiction and non-fiction big books, picture 
and bilingual dictionaries, and magazines & other authentic texts.  These materials will be used with newcomer ELLs, 
developing ELLs, as well as ELLs in special education.  We will also utilize online reading resources such as RAZ Kids and Go 
Math.   
  
Many visuals will be used to support language learning, such as photographs, drawings, and video clips.  Visual materials are 
helpful to all ELLs at each stage of language development.   
Centers will be used both in the classroom as well as in the ESL program to help students develop language, with different 
centers for different subgroups of ELLs.  Listening centers on different levels will be used for all subgroups, vocabulary centers 
and will be differentiated to help newcomer ELLs develop basic vocabulary, and more complex academic vocabulary centers 
will be used for more advanced ELLs.  Centers with content area enforcement will be available at different levels for newcomer 
ELLs, more advanced ELLs, and ELLs in special education.   
A variety of graphic organizers will be used to assist ELLs at all stages and proficiency in various kinds and different levels of 
writing.  Charts made both by the teacher and with the class will be hung around the room to support students during lessons 
and independent work.   
The use of manipulatives, songs, poems & rhythm and TPR are useful for all ELLs as well as hands-on activities and 
technological resources.   
In the classroom, supplemental materials such as flashcards, manipulatives and math games will be used to help struggling 
students at all proficiency levels in mathematics.   
The science teacher will also offer support to all ELLs using hands-on activities, manipulatives, flash cards, assistance in 
experimentation, and vocabulary development activities and reinforcement. 
PS 360 also recognizes the importance of technology in education, especially for ELLs at all proficiency levels.  Every classroom 
is equipped with a Permethian board, a class set of laptops, and shared document cameras.  Permethian boards are used for 
interactive learning, and also facilitate the use of video in instruction.  The combination of visual and interactive learning is

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
PS 360 invites all parents to the school during the week before the start of the new school year. Parents come to school with 
their children and are given an orientation.  Parents can meet their child’s teacher, the administration, other parents and the 
children in their child’s class.  Parents are also given the opportunity to become familiar with the school building, and the 
curricular expectations of kindergarten.  ELL parents are always invited to attend.                  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

There are currently no language electives offered at PS 360.  We may consider supplemental, enrichment language electives at 
a later date.              
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

PS 360 does not currently have a dual language program.       
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional Development for all personnel at the school will be as follows: 
ENL teachers and administrators provide professional development for all personnel who work with ELLs during select faculty 
conferences, admin periods, instructional team meetings, and one-on-one with teachers.  Additional dates will be added to the 
calendar below as they are selected. Our instructional team’s focus this year is the continued implementation of the Common 
Core Standards.  Throughout these meetings, we will also be exploring, discussing, and brainstorming ideas about the 
application of these standards with ELL's as they arrive to our school.  These meetings cover topics such as the Universal 
Design for Learning. Teachers, coaches, and administrators are always exploring ways to utilize the UDL concept for all 
students in order to make the Common Core Standards accessible. 
Additional Professional Development for ENL teachers assigned and Coordinators will include UFT ESL/Bilingual Committee 
Workshops, ELL Literacy Workshops, and the NYS TESOL Conference. 
  
In the future, classroom teachers, ENL teachers, literacy coaches and administrators will meet multiple times per month for in-
house professional development during common preps, administrative meetings, and the instructional team meetings to 
discuss the implementation of the Common Core, the Danielson’s rubric, and Universal Design for Learning. During these 
sessions, how to make the Common Core Standards accessible to English Language Learners will be discussed, particularly in 
the context of Response to Intervention and the Universal Design for Learning. 
  
Additionally, contracted professional development for classroom teachers as well as ENL teachers will also focus on the 
common core and will always cover topics relating to ELL accessibility to the common core state standards. 
  
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
ENL teachers will provide support and will be available to staff, students, and parents to assist ELLs as they transition from 
elementary to middle school.  ENL teachers will consult with parents, teachers, and students on issues related to transitioning 
to middle school and the social aspects of coming into a new country or new school.  ENL teachers, administrators, and our 
community associate will also provide information to parents, teachers, and other school staff about ENL programs in middle 
schools, exam information, the general transition period, and creating support networks in their new school.  Eventually, our 
community associate and 5th grade teachers will guide all 5th grade families (including the families of ELLs) through the middle 
school selection process, provide them with information about special testing for middle school admission, etc. In addition to 
this, our school will hold multiple informational assemblies for students hosted by neighborhood middle schools.  ENL teachers 
and the community associate will reach out to parents about any issues/questions they may have regarding their child’s 
future.  As students grow up and work through middle school and trasition to High School, the PS 360 staff will continue to 
maintain relationships with families and provide support where they can as their children grow.   
  
  
 All ELL and non-ELL staff will receive or work towards the minimum ELL training. New teachers will be identified and provided 
with professional development and extra support in working with ELLs.  Teachers will also be made aware of various 
professional development opportunities available outside of the regular school day, such as the UFT Bilingual/ESL Committee 
Meetings, State TESOL conferene, and office of ELL trainings and professional development sessions.  Documentation of the 
hours of training will be placed in the personal file of all participating teachers and staff.  
               
 
 

Parental Involvement 

 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
ENL teachers will meet anually with individual parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development progress, 
language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. Meetings will take place during 
the time allocated for parent contact, during the school day, and during telephone conferences, and as a last resource, in 
writing, if parents are unable to come to the school.  Interpreters from our staff or from the over-the-phone translation unit 
would be made available during these meetings. ENL teachers will keep logs of all parent contact.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents of newcomer ELLs will be invited to attend the parent orientation meeting to be introduced to the program choices 
available to them.  Parents will also be invited to school at different times throughout the school year in order to participate in 
classroom celebrations and student work showcases, as well as the family literacy programs.   Lower grade parents will be 
invited to read with the children during morning conferences.  Also, parents will be involved in various activities such as:  
*Monthly workshops with guest speakers on various topics 
*Lending Library where parents can borrow books 
*Games, bingo and karaoke nights 
*Field trips 
*PTA activities 
*Fundraising activities   
*Parents as Reading Partners   
In our school we will utilize the Translation and Interpretation Unit.  Phone calls home will be made with the assistance of the 
over the phone translation services, and letters will be sent home in both parents’ native language and English.  PS 360’s the 
community associate will conduct regular English and Citizenship classes for parents who wish to attend.  Classes will be held 
twice weekly during the morning hours.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Rachel Thomas, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

1. PS 360 distributed the Language Preference Survey created by the NYCDOE (available on the NYCDOE website) 
to every child’s parent (grades Pre-k-Third Grade) in order to assess our school’s written translation and oral 
interpretation needs to ensure that parents are provided with information in a language they can understand. 
Surveys were distributed and completed by parents upon completion of the registration process. Based on parent 
survey, the school is able to communicate with parents in the language of their preference.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

PS 360 is always in close contact with parents through individual parent meetings and phone calls, parents teacher 
conferences, open school nights, family events, school celebrations and activities, etc. In the future when translation 
and interpretation services are available, we will always ask parents for feedback immediately following the 
meeting/conference/contact. We will continuously survey parents orally to get feedback on translation and 
interpretation services, and carefully consider feedback, suggestions, and support from parents and the community.
