Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

We are committed to building a community of lifelong learners who will be endowed with the knowledge, skills, 
attitudes and quality of character necessary to be successful, contributing members of this ever changing global 
society. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Our students will be guided to set goals for reaching their highest potential. They will receive quality standards based 
instruction that will maximize the development of their abilities, skills and talents. They will be expected to develop 
proficiency in the core curriculum areas of reading, mathematics, science and social studies. to meet and exceed the 
NYS and NYC standards. 

The school's curriculum and classroom instruction will engage our students in rigorous application of skills and 
strategies. Students will develop the skill of using evidence to support arguments in discussion, which will then 
transfer to stronger writing in literacy and math, and develop the communication and collaboration skills that support 
college and career readiness.  

Our community of educators, support staff, parents and community members are expected to work in collaboration 
with one another to convey high expectations for each and every child, to nurture our students with respect and 
encouragement in order to achieve their maximum potential, and to create a safe, secure, healthy, warm and 
welcoming environment. These proven practices will lead us to the realization of our mission and goals toward a 
successful learning environment. 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 176Q is made up of a community of staff, parents and students that is deeply committed to working 
collaboratively towards a common goal. Our purpose is to guarantee the highest quality of education for our students. 
On a daily basis throughout the school year we strive to promote a safe, calm and nurturing environment for all of our 
students. We work to ensure that all of our students will succeed and be college and/or career ready. Our motto is 
“Committed to building a community of life- long learners. 

School leaders allocate resources and make decision aligned to the school’s instructional goals that promote student 
achievement. Together the school community makes meaningful decisions about scheduling student and teacher time 
to maximize learning opportunities and teacher collaboration time for planning and evaluating student work. 
Schedule adjustments are made to ensure teachers have a minimum of three common planning periods per week to 
develop or modify unit plans. High expectations are communicated and supports are provided to ensure all members 
of the school community takes ownership of increased student achievement. 

Together with families we work collaboratively to understand student needs and share responsibility for student 
progress toward higher expectations. School leaders conduct frequent observations and work collaboratively with 
teachers to develop professional plans that promote professional growth and reflection. School administrators work 
collaboratively with teachers and staff to develop professional learning plans, that support our school wide focus and 
targets our areas of need. 

Our students engage in project based learning. Units of study are developed and refined annually to ensure that our 
students receive standards based instruction that is intellectually stimulating. Our students are provided instruction in 
visual art, instrument music, vocal music and S.T.E.M. We believe in educating the whole student while 
acknowledging various learning styles. We have ELL, Special Needs and Gifted and Talented students all working 
together. Each student has the same opportunity to engage in learning.  

 

P.S. 176Q currently offers a NYCDOE Gifted and Talented program for Kindergarten- Grade 5 students. This program is 
designed to support the needs of exceptional students. The Gifted and Talented program delivers rigorous and 
specialized instruction aligned to Common Core Learning Standards. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We are the district site for the Talented and Gifted Program. These children require accelerated learning 
opportunities, arts based programs and enrichment programs. 

Students with disabilities have specific needs and typically struggle in reading grade level text due to text complexity 
and rich vocabulary. Additionally, making claims and defending claims using text based evidence may be a challenge. 

In terms of mathematics students with special needs and ELL students do not have the basic foundational concepts 
that are required to have access to grade level standards. Our students have difficulty solving multi-step word 
problems and struggle with mathematical fluency. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

During the 2017- 2018 the element of the Framework for Great Schools in which we made the most progress was 
Rigorous Instruction. As noted in the 2017-2018 Principal's Performance Review our students are engaged in 
appropriately challenging tasks that demonstrate critical thinking and creativity. In addition the understanding of 
students is deepened through effective questions and discussion. The curricula is aligned to the Common Core 
Learning Standards which ensures individual students are cognitively engaged.  

 

However, the Principal's Performance Review also indicates a need for more rigorous instruction for our Special 
Education students. During the 2018-2019 school year teachers of special need students will engage in ongoing 
professional development, inter-class visitations and case studies to help improve their craft and create challenging 
curriculum for our students. In addition we have created 6 Integrated Co-Teaching classes and 3 self contained bridge 
class. 

 

Our focus for the school year 2018- 2019 will be Collaborative Teaching in order to build cohesiveness within and 
across grade levels. Teachers will work together on a regular basis to develop and establish grade level expectations. 
Teachers will work on subject/content teams, in addition to grade level teams. These teams will help plan culminating 
tasks in each unit of study that will increase the level of rigor and allow for student choice and differentiation.

based program for use at home. The parent coordinator, Assistant Principals and the Testing Coordinator are 
responsible for the implementation and oversight of these activities from September 2018 to June 2019.  

We will utilize the Tuesday Parent Engagement block to reach out to parents and guardians to meet face to face or by 
telephone to have conversations about student strengths and areas of concern. In addition parents will be provided 
be given the opportunity to learn more about accountability systems,such as, CCLS assessment expectations, School 
Snapshot, Learning Environment Survey and to allow parents to provide suggestions during PTA and SLT meetings.

In an effort to increase parent involvement and engagement in the areas of providing and promoting a supportive 
environment, we ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities 
and strategies as described in our Parent Involvement Policy and the School Parent Compact. 

We provide parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children and foster a caring and effective home school partnership to 
ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor their child's progress. 

We utilize Parent Engagement Tuesdays to reach out to parents and guardians throughout the school year. It is the 
responsibility of teachers, administrators, guidance counselor, social worker, paraprofessionals, parent coordinator to 
ensure that parents feel supported at our school.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

After conducting a comprehensive needs assessment including the 2017- 2018 Principal's Performance Review; 2016- 
2017 Principal’s Performance Observation; 2017- 2018 School Snapshot , 2017- 2018 NYS Student Assessment data 
and 2017-2018 Teacher Surveys the following strengths and needs were noted: 

Strengths:  

Teachers use instructional practices and strategies organized around annual unit and daily lesson plans to meet 
established student goals and promote high levels of student engagement. 

Teachers provide coherent, appropriately aligned Common Core Learning Standards based instruction that leads to 
multiple points of entry for all students to achieve targeted goals. 

Teachers use a variety of data sources to measure students’ progress . 

Teachers participate in professional learning venues that focus on streghtened teacher pedagogical capacity and 
continuous student improvement via implementation of the Common Core Learning Standard and instructional shifts. 

All teachers meet in vertical and horizontal teams using an inquiry approach to improve classroom practice. 

 

Priority Needs:  

While teaching practices provide instructional support and rigor, there are teachers who are passive in their 
participation.  

Collaborative planning for questioning, discussion techniques and group work is needed to ensure all students are 
actively engaged during lessons. 

Teacher teams need to utilize various protocols for looking at student work and all teachers must select and follow 
roles during team meetings. 

In an attempt to close the gap in student learning, teacher effectiveness and pedagogical skills so that all teachers can 
contribute equally when collaborating and planning, we will provide differentiated opportunities to build the capacity 
of teachers.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on surveys and monthly meetings with parents, there is a need for more workshops and events to bring the 
community together. This includes workshops around curriculum and how parents can better support their children 
at home. Parents have expressed a great desire to work more collaboratively with the school on behalf of their child's 
education. Parents struggle to help their children at home, specifically with reading and mathematics. Therefore there 
is a need for more workshops and parent engagement on ways to support ELL families and families of students with 
special needs. We are working on ways to unite the community in many ways other than workshops. This includes 
Family Fun Nights (Physical Education, Math Madness, Art, Science, Literacy, etc.). Based on our school data we need 
to continue to bring parents and families into the school for meetings, workshop, activities and continue to increase 
communication between teachers and families. 

Strengths:  

1) Systems of Communication (Class Dojo; Bloomz; Facebook; Twitter; School Messenger) 

2) Family Workshops 

3)Parent/ Teacher Trust 

4) Monthly Newsletter and Calendar

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
Transition plans for preschool children to our school begin with an outreach by our Parent Coordinator to preschool 
programs within our zoned areas. During this discussion with the preschool director, the Parent Coordinator can assist 
in identifying students who are zoned for our school, and set up a visitation schedule for parents to come and visit our 
school. We have a Parent Orientation meeting in which our Parent Coordinator, Pupil Accounting Secretary, 
Kindergarten teachers and PTA will share some of our school’s special programs and answer parent questions. 

The Turing 5 program addresses students with special needs. Our School Psychologist and Social Worker are involved 
in classroom visits and observations to pre- school programs to assess student needs for the least restrictive 
environment placement. During their visitation they meet with the child’s classroom teachers as well as the preschool 
director to discuss the child and answer any questions. Our related service providers can also speak with parents and 
provide information. 

Throughout the entire transition process our Parent Coordinator, Pupil Accounting Secretary, Assistant Principals and 
PTA can meet with preschool parents and take them on a tour of our building so that they can view the programs that 
we offer and make an informed decision for their child. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Assessments must be meaningful and have a purpose. We look for quality and not quantity in making our selections. 
Our school’s decisions regarding assessments are made collaboratively with our teachers. Grade leaders meet with 
our instructional leads and administration to discuss the quality of assessments and its purpose in measuring student 
results and accelerating student progress. Grade leaders share the information with their colleagues and return to a 
second meeting with feedback from their cohort. A review of the assessment plan is completed with assessments 
removed if they are not essential to measuring student progress. An assessment plan is developed at this meeting and 
presented to all stakeholders during our common planning time. The document is open for discussion and review. The 
assessment plan document is presented to the School Leadership Team and PTA for further discussion. The 
assessment plan is adopted and implemented with teacher confirmation and consent.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 



Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 176Q , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the ESSA, is 
responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of 
student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed 
by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are 
encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee 
as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

P.S. 176Q will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At P.S. 176Q we use multiple measures to assess all students including ENLs.  Teachers administer assessments such as 
the Fountas and Pinnel (F&P), I-ready benchmark assessment along with other school-created assessments.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

During registration, we utilized a trained ENL pedagogue to identify students who are eligibile for NYSITELL testing. Once a 
student has been identified for NYSITELL testing, we then administer the appropriate screen 
and determine the child's languague proficiency. 
The ENL teacher then collaborates with administration and classroom teachers to discuss the appropriate number of 
minutes for each child based on their English Proficiency levels. The ENL teacher then provides pull out ENL services in order to 
support the child's language acquisition.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
As a school, we utilized common summative assessments. Assessments includes:  
-Fountas and Pinnell   
-School- created writing assessment  
-School- created Math Assessments  
-i- ready Assessments  
In addition to the above, we administer the NYSESLAT, ELA, Math and Science state assessments.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data is analyzed the ENL teacher  works collaboratively with the classroom teacher to design an 
intervention program to meet the needs of the students.The ENL teacher uses ESL methodolgies such as 
total physical response and explict vocabulary instruction. Through these techniques, students are able to make strides.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
PS 176 uses data from multiple sources to guide instruction for ENLs within the RTI framework. The ENL 
teacher meets with the classroom teacher to  discuss  students' performance. 
The ENL teacher and the classroom teacher engage in on-going collaboration throughout the year to ensure that instruction is 
tailored and differntiated for each child.  
In addition, the school utilizes state assessment data such as the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL and ELA & Math state assessments to 
guide the instructional grouping and instruction for each child - we tailor our instruction based on the child's modality.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
At our school we utilize state assessment data, and local measures to evaluate our program. After analysis the data, we 
noticed that there are areas of opportunities within our program. For example, we noticed that 2 out of 7 
students scored commanding, 3 students made no significant growth, and there was no growth of evidnce for one student.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

All service providers meet during the School Intervention Team meeting to discuss the findings of our ENL data.  Once the data 
has been analyzed interventions are put into place to meet the needs of the students. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The ENL program allows for students to be grouped homogeneously.  They are taken by proficiency and grade 
level.  Students are taken together  if they are in 2 consecutive grades. The 3 first graders are taken with the 1 
kindergarten student.  The 4  th   and 5  th   graders are taken together.  The one first grader who needs an additional 
180 minutes receives this. The ESL teacher who is dual certified(common branches and ESL) takes students out and 
pushes into rooms. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           There is one full time ESL teacher who provides ESL services due to the small ratio of 10:1.  We are able to ensure that all 
ELL students  receive the proper services as per CR Part 154.  We have 1 emerging student who recieves 360 minutes a week of 
services.    We have 9 expanding students who receive 180 minutes of service a week.  All Commanding students (3) receive 90 
minutes of instruction weekly. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   The push in and pull out programs are aligned to meet the NYS CCLS.  The ESL teacher frequently utilizes lessons from Engage 
NY, which is NYS treasure trove of CCLS lessons.  The lessons are modified to meet the needs of English Language 
Learners.  The ENL teacher uses additonal graphic organizers and vocabulary enriching activities as well as developing schema 
for all students, strategies that have been proven successful with English Language Learners are incorporated into all lessons. 
Content areas are supported with specific lessons to introduce and deepen academic langUAge vocabulary. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Students are not evaluated in the home language because they do not receive instruction in their home language at school. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 A. Differentiation for SIFE students is delivered by providing scaffolds that first help students’ master foundational skills in ELA 
and Math with plenty of practice and repetition in small groups. SIFE students also taught using theme-based lessons that 
provide many scaffolds to help with understanding. We currently do not have any students who are SIFE. 
B. Differentiation for newcomers is delivered by instruction that is theme-based with native language supports and scaffolds 
that help with comprehensible input. Strengths in students’ native language are assessed and used to help drive instruction. 
C. Differentiation for developing students is the use of scaffolds that are provided and used until students master the language 
and content without those scaffolds for all content areas. 
D. Differentiation for Long Term ENLs is providing individualized support in the content areas within small groups based on 
feedback from assessments.  
E. Differentiation for Former ENLs is provided for 90 minutes (.5 units) during integrated co-teaching ELA instruction for two 
years. These students continue to receive extended time for exams and small group instruction to reinforce and extend 
content area skills. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ENLs  identified as having special needs are provided with all the services to which they are entitiled (speach, SETTS, OT, 
ESL).  RTI meetings address the academic needs.   We also have small group time for students with the ESL teacher.  Study skills 
and test taking strategies are explicitly taught.  Students are taught how to use graphic organizers and acronyms for important 
strategies.  Teachers work together to schedule time for ELL-SWD where the maximum learning can take place.  Instructional 
materials are shared to create a chohesion between the classroom and the ELL classroom.  The ENL teacher creates a parellel 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

with what is being taught in the mainstream classroom and delivers the content form the classroom using ESL 
methodology.The instructional strategies and grade level materials that teachers use for ELL SWD students by using data for 
structuring learning centers based on flexible grouping. The learning centers include both: fiction and non-fiction, spelling, 
grammar and technology. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Students With Disabilities are placed in the least restrictive environment.   The ENL students who are also SWD are serviced in 
order to maximize learning.  The ENL teacher, mainstream classroom teacher and the special education teacher collaborate to 
implement the IEP goals and meet the grade level CCLS. Currently all ELLs with IEPs are in Collaborative Team Teaching 
classroomsENL services for ELL-SWDs include a pull out program. In the 3,4,5 grades Special Education is delivered through the 
ICT model.   All teachers servicing these students are well- informed on each child's IEP goals and learning needs.  In the ICT 
classroom the special education and general education teachers work cooperatively in planning the curriculum and the 
delivery of instruction. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All interventions are in English.  Students receive content area support in the areas they need assistance.  We currently use 
Study Island to support students in grades 2-5 in all content areas.  Starfall is the support system used for students in 
Kingergarten to Grade 2.   The aforementioned computer based programs are aligned to progress made by the 
students.  Lesson are offered based on identified strengths and areas of need. RAZZ kids is also made available. Computer 
assisted programs are able to be accessed from the home, allowing for additional learning time. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are seeking to add additional technology programs so that students can progress at their own pace or seek intervention to 
address areas in which they are not demonstrating proficiency.  The ENL teacher is implementing a lunch and learn where she 
takes the ENL students and some of their English dominant peers during lunch.  Books are read and discussed.  This provides 
for additional contact time without sacrificing content area time. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

There is no plan to discontinue any services or programs at this time. All programs have proved effective as per our formal and 
informal assessments.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Any and all communications about additional school programs are translated into the students native language and phone calls 
to parents reminding them about theses programs are made by staff who speak the home languages.   All ELLs are encouraged 
to attend Saturday Academy in order to meet their needs.  The Saturday Academy program provides enrichment to struggling 
students. There is also a morning learning program that ENLs are invited to attend.   In addition to equal academic services, all 
students including ENLs participate in our S.T.E.M program, Chorus, Dance, Visual Arts, pajama nights, math family nights and 
Instrumental Music program.    Furthermore ELL students receive RTI and AIS services based on their needs. The ENL teacher 
continually monitors the lists of students in all extracurricular activities and makes sure ENLs are represented.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 Study Island, Starfall, ReadyGen, GoMath, Expeditionary Learning; NYS Progress; and Engage NY are all programs afforded our 
ELL students including all subgroups.   These programs  each have a computer based component.   Each program is designed to 
include an intervention component and an enrichment component.  ENLs are afforded equal access to all programs in our 
building. ENLs are included in afterschool programs for ELA and Math.  When working with math students have multiple 
manipulatives to choose from to assist them in acquiring the concepts.  When working in ELA ENL students are given choices of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

how to demonstrate that they have gained the knowledge.  For ELA graphic organizers, writing journals, and jotting are used to 
help students monitor reading.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language is supported through the use of available translation services during conferences.  Parents may opt to receive 
notices in their home language.   Interpretation services are avaialable during the school day, during evening conferences and 
telephone conferences. Our librarian has a section of books that are available in Haitian Creole and Spanish, that students can 
borrow and bring home to share with their family.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

PS 176 ensures that all required services/resources support and correspond to ENL’s ages and grade levels by making sure that 
students are properly placed when enrolled by adhering to the Chancellor’s Regulations and protocols for registration. If a 
student’s age does not match their grade, we use all resources at our disposal to assess whether a placement at a higher/lower 
grade level is appropriate.  All resources are aligned with the Common Core Standards for each grade.  All services are grade 
and age appropriate. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 Study Island, Starfall, ReadyGen, GoMath, Expeditionary Learning; NYS Progress; and Engage NY are all programs afforded our 
ELL students including all subgroups.   These programs  each have a computer based component.   Each program is designed to 
include an intervention component and an enrichment component.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all programs in our 
building. ELLs are included in afterschool programs for ELA and Math.  When working with math students have multiple 
manipulatives to choose from to assist them in acquiring the concepts.  When working in ELA esl students are given choices of 
how to demonstrate that they have gained the knowledge.  For ELA graphic organizers, writing journals, and jotting are used to 
help students monitor reading.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ENLs are introduced to staff members who speak their home language in order to provide them with a 
resource when they begin school, Mrs. Charles for Haitian Creole parents and Mrs. Ramos for Spanish speaking families.   The 
Parent Coordinator is an additional support for new ENL students and their parents.  The IEP teacher is also the Youth 
Development Liaison and is responsible for creating a buddy system to help new students adjust to their new environment. 
Newly enrolled ENLs are assisted by the ENL teacher during registration. Parents are given a tour of the school and given a 
parent handbook in the preferred native language of the parent. They are shown the Parent Orientation Video and all 
questions about programs, lunch, and school times are answered. Incoming Kindergarten students and their families are given 
a kindergarten orientation with translators and a tour of the building by the kindergarten teachers and the parent 
coordinator.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We currently have Spanish offered at our school.  The elective is open to certain classes if an ELL is in that class they 
participate. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Common Branch Teachers, ESL teacher, Special Education teachers, Paraprofessionals, Guidance Counselors, Psychologists, OT 
and PT teachers, Speech Teacher members of the SBST, Assistant Principals and Principal  receive staff development 
throughout the year.  Items such as identifying students, NYSITELL, NYSESLAT assessments, placement procedures, 
promotional criteria, RTI and Special Education are discussed.  In addition professional development workshops cover CCLS, 
instructional strategies and team building.The ESL teacher is a member of the Professional Development committee and as a 
member insures that all Professional Development has an ENL component.  Strategies that help students acquire content area 
vocabulary are taught.  Workshops are given on how to contact parents using translation services.  Secretaries are 
given  different Professional Development  they learn about how to help new parents,  what role the ENL teacher has in 
student registration, what signs and resources must be available in the main office to help parents who speak a language other 
than English, who in the building can assist in translation and which languages personnel speak and where they are located.   
.Teachers receive professional development on adapting curriculum for ELL students.   Teachers review the CCLS and develop 
lesson plans which address the learning standards.  These lessons are adapted to meet the needs of the student, but do not 
compromise the integrity of the standard.  Teachers engage in team planning, demonstration lessons and team teaching. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Staff is provided support to help ease the transition from elementary school to middle school.  The grade 5 teachers are given 
professional development to help with the transition.  The Guidance Counselor and the ENL teacher provide workshops for 
transitioning students and their parents.  These workshops include but are not limited to the following: peer pressure; what to 
expect in middle school; developing study habits and developing time management skills. 
The professional development team creates a schedule of workshop topics.   15% of the workshop hours are dedicated to 
language acquistion, co-teaching and best practices.  Agendas are created and attendance sheets are signed to ensure all 
teachers have met their required number of hours of professional development.   The records are maintained in a central 
location either in the office or the ENL teachers classroom. The ENL teacher attends workshops offered by the Office of ENLs to 
ensure 50% of the professional development is ENL specific.  The ENL teacher provides the administration a copy of the 
workshop handouts as evidence of participation.  In addition the ENL teacher may turn-key information. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parent Engagement Tuesdays allow the ENL teacher, Guidance Counselor, Classroom Teacher and LPT members to meet with 
parents to discuss the goals of the program, language development progress, assessment results and any additional 
needs.  Parents are invited to attend these individualized meetings.  Translation and interpretation provisions are provided 
either by a staff member or a community member who speaks and writes in the home language of the parent. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

All workshops are attended by staff who can translate for parents.  The Parent Coordinator schedules parent engagement 
activities which include, but not limited to the following: Nutrition Class; CCLS; Arts and Crafts; Healthy Living through Exercise; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Arlene Bartlett, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Each first time entrant to the NYC DOE completes the HLIS. The student and parent are informally interviewed by 
the ESL teacher. At this time the parent communicates which language they perfer the school to use for all 
correspondance. In addition on the Emergency Contact card parents indicate their preference for oral 
communication. This information is documented in ATS. School staff or the Citywide Translation Unit are used for 
oral and/or written parent communication in languages other than English. 

.  

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
