Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and informed by New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality

Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Implement at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify 

the instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content 
standards; provide time for collaboration on the use of) beginning no later than the 2018-19 school year. 

  Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 8: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 
Vision Statement   

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

The vision of James P. Sinnott Magnet School for Health and Health Careers, JHS 218 - a Beacon of East New York - a 
Community School, is to cultivate a winning culture of resiliency and academic excellence where everyone thrives.  

Mission Statement 

The mission of James P. Sinnott Magnet School for Health and Health Careers, JHS 218 is to empower our scholars to 
achieve academic, social and emotional success through a safe and supportive learning environment.  

"Raise the Bar, Elevate the Mind, Soar to Success" 

 
2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, including 

a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented. 

Sinnott's Strengths comprise of the following: 

 

● The Principal has lead staff and students to commit to improvement, which promotes high expectations and 
supports to achieve goals. The foci are based on the Citywide Instructional Expectations and development of a 
rigorous curriculum to improve student outcomes. We’ve established a culture for learning that communicates high 
expectation to staff, students and families while providing supports to achieve these expectations. We use multiple 
means of communication such as, the use of Danielson Framework for Teaching, computer room for teachers to 
access and improve lessons, monthly school calendar of events, Blackboard Connect (phone messenger), memos via 
parent engagement folders, exterior bulletin board, exterior sign, parent and student book clubs, using parent 
engagement time on Tuesday afternoons to discuss student progress and next steps. In addition, school 
administrators, deans, teachers, and counselors collaborate with organizations such as 21st Century to promote our 
high expectations as well as make students aware of life after junior high school.  

● Our staff engages in structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes 
shared leadership and focuses on improved student learning. The current structures that inform professional 
collaborations are, horizontal and vertical teams that meet on Mondays and Tuesdays during our PLO to look at 
student work, analyze data and case conference. Our lead teachers attend PLOs in Math, ELA, ESL, and Special 
Education regularly and prepare to turnkey information to their peers. 

● The principal along with the administrative team makes strategic organizational decisions aligned to school goals 
that advance student-learning needs. We have implemented a Health Magnet Program comprising of a 
heterogeneous group of students who applied to the program and were selected on the basis of essay writing, 
interviews, interest and attendance. Through this program we partner with organizations such as the Grow to Learn, 
City Year, and 218 Sinnott Explorers and Post #370 Explorers.  

 

 

 

 
3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

Students with special needs; autism spectrum, emotional disturbance, etc require the support of paraprofessionals, 
use of technology, receive setss and mandated guidance support. Students who are new to the country and ENLs, are 
supported in the classroom with visuals, dictionaries and technology. 

 

4.  Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the 

past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Over the past year, our school’s strategies and practices have moved to align with the concepts in the Proficient 
column of the Quality Review Statements: 

1.1 Ensuring engaging, rigorous, and coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners and aligned

● Engage students in rigorous tasks and activities planned out in unit plans that allow for critical thinking as evident in 
their work, Socratic seminar, portfolios and discussions. 

● Use common assessments that align to the schools’ instructional focus so that data analysis is utilized to measure 
student progress toward school wide goals.  

● Utilize data to inform instruction from Scantron, informal and formal assessments and use of multiple resources to 
show progress.  

● Implement scaffolding techniques for SwDs and ENLs in each class and Professional Development. 

● Increase parent involvement with multiple sources like Pitney Bowes mailing system and "constant contact". 

● Create a positive and respectful environment, with a clear ladder of referral and high expectations. 

 

For the 2017 - 2018 school year we implemented monitoring systems which will track observation data, social-
emotional data, progress monitoring via iReady and MyOn and will continue to do so for 2018 - 2019. 

 

 

5.  Identify at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify the 

instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content standards; 
provide time for collaboration on the use of data) to be implemented in the 2018-19 school year. 

We redesigned the programming for ELA and added writing.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment

Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction 
(DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and 
address student achievement needs. 
The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner 
within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the 
arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities. 
Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative 
assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our Instructional Focus for the 2018 - 2019 school year is: 

All students will be engaged in explicit instruction designed to facilitate discourse. 

 

Our school is consistently engaged in curricular planning and modifications towards the Common Core Learning 
Standards alignment and integration of the instructional shifts to ensure access and cognitive engagement for our 
learners. We are continuing the use of the CodeX curriculum and GO MATH curriculum as they are aligned to the 
Standards and the needs of our students. Our teacher content area teams meet every other week to plan and modify 
units and lessons using data gathered from assessments embedded in the curriculum. Modifications and revisions will 
be made continuously to the curriculum such as re-teaching.  

In order to align our practices to the concepts in the Developing column within Tenet 3, we need to develop and 
implement protocols and monitoring systems for reviewing unit and lesson plans to assure alignment with the Common 
Core Learning Standards and New York State content standards. Focus meeting time on the rigor of the CCLS and the 
use of data to adjust curricula to ensure growth in student achievement including SWD's and ELL's. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          16 

 

Although data is being used to inform instruction, we still need to improve the use of common assessments by explicitly 
linking them to the school’s instructional priorities so that formative and summative data analysis is utilized to measure 
student progress towards school-wide goals and adjust instructional practices to show progress. We still need to have a 
clear process to analyze the findings of the assessments in order to address individual student needs. Additionally we 
also need to create a process to revise and refine curricula and instructional practices as well as assignments for ELL's 
and SWD's.  

The priority will be to: 

- Incorporate UDL strategies in the development of unit and lesson plans to address the needs of the learners' abilities 
as well as technology and interdisciplinary lessons. 

- Use ‘Looking at Student Work Protocol’ to analyze student data from common assessments 

- Create and follow a protocol for revising and refining unit and lesson plans based upon the analysis of student data and 
use of "Data Wise" process including scaffolds for SWD's and ELL's. 

- 

We will implement monitoring systems to monitor progress.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

 

funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. James P. Sinnott, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

James P Sinnott will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
The 21st Century program sought to supplement academic instruction and leadership development by educating the 
whole student through a variety of enrichment programs, enumerated below. 

-Basketball, Martial Arts, and Yoga/Fitness clubs encouraged physical education and fitness through weekly practices. 
New skills will supplement health and physical learning, as well as encourage leadership, self-discipline, team building, 
and sportsmanship through discourse and competition. 

-Cooking club sought to teach nutrition through healthy cooking and preparation of recipes. Planning, problem-
solving, and measurement skills can be applicable to math and science development. 

-HerStory (Girls Leadership) aimed to foster leadership skills, community building, and Social Emotional Learning 
through open discourse and creating a shared artistic project. This club also identified role models in media and 
students’ everyday life. It also promoted the empowerment of young women of color. 

- Visual Arts, Crochet, and Fashion/Jewelry Making clubs encouraged creative expression and community building 
through the making of original projects (example: learning foundational artistic skills and styles or building individual 
accessories). Applicable to growth in ELA and literacy building. 

-Chess and Games clubs developed strategic thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as sportsmanship in a 
competition setting. Skills were applicable to science and mathematics learning. 

-Steel Drum club taught students to read, establish and follow rhythms, and perform music while building an 
ensemble community. Students participated in multiple performances to build self-confidence. Skills are applicable to 
growth in mathematics and literacy. 

-Drama club promoted leadership, cooperation, and self-worth through building an ensemble and improvising original 
scenes. Students built literacy skills through the rehearsal and study of plays/scenes, and it promoted original work by 
young student-artists of color. Skills gained are applicable to ELA and literacy. 

-Academic per session sought to prepare 8th grade students interested in taking Regents Algebra/Living Environment 
exams at end of school year. Through open discourse and weekly instruction, students received support in math and 
science learning. Students also gained awareness of supporting their peers within a community and college/career 
readiness. 

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
BY JUNE 2019: 

Increase after-school enrollment and exposure to new services and opportunities by incorporating 60% of overall 
student population in enrichment services. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

At minimum, 250 students will be enrolled and participate in 30 hours of 21st Century programming during the course 
of the year. 15 hours of after-school and lunchtime enrichment programs will be offered per week. 

All after-school providers will participate in weekly all-after school meetings designed to troubleshoot existing 
systems and promote each other’s programming, as well as create and maintain a central placement tracker for 
students and staff involved in enrichment programs. 

 

Increase parent engagement to encourage student participation and academic excellence 

21st Century will plan and facilitate 5 parent workshops w/ 21st Century, Beacon/Cypress Hills. In addition, the 21st 
Century after-school team will facilitate two showcases next year to invite parents to campus and to share students’ 
growth and learning. 

Increase staff engagement and awareness of opportunities to incorporate SEL into daily instruction 

The Leadership Program will facilitate 5 PD workshops focused on promoting SEL among students and upstander 
strategies to engage students more fully in the improvement of school culture. In addition, Creative Connections will 
provide three sustainability and grant-writing workshops to encourage staff’s data learning. 

 

 

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students? 
Goal 1: ELA/Math—experience instruction and literacy aligned to common core standards, reflected in curriculum 
with focus on college/career readiness 

Students will participate in bi-weekly after-school workshops to acquire new skills (i.e. leadership development, 
community building and awareness, sportsmanship, problem-solving and strategic thinking, individual and group 
creative expression) to supplement their academic instruction. In addition to fostering a stronger sense of community 
and school culture, students will build self-esteem and individual styles of leadership, problem solving skills and 
patience to supplement scientific and mathematical learning, and communication skills to support ELA and literacy 
development. 

Goal 2: Decrease principal suspensions by 5% 

Students who are at risk of suspension will be encouraged to participate in activities that develop self-discipline and 
support them as members of a strong community (i.e. martial arts, yoga/fitness, or basketball. If a student shows 
leadership potential and knowledge in a specific area of instruction (for example, chess or games proficiency), they 
will be invited to serve in a leadership role within their club as a student apprentice. This allows for students at risk of 
suspension to instruct younger students from a place of positive leadership and expert knowledge, as well as to foster 
strong working relationships with an after-school mentor. 

Goal 3: Teachers participate in professional learning teams/activities and data inquiry 

The 21st Century program will provide 5 professional development workshops (with a focus on promoting students’ 
social emotional learning, problem-solving skills, and leadership development) and three grant-writing/sustainability 
workshops to school staff to supplement the school’s professional development agenda. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

Goal 4: Parent engagement in collaboration w/CBO partners 

The Leadership Program will provide 5 parent workshops aimed at developing parents’ communication and leadership 
abilities, as well as workshops in physical health, nutrition, or requested subjects that parents wish to explore more 
deeply in order to support their students. The 21st Century program will also offer two student showcases to promote 
student growth and newly developed skills, with the aim to help parents support student growth, attendance, and 
self-esteem.

Part 3 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part 3a. Indicate resources your Community Partnership will leverage to achieve your summative SMART goal(s) and 
implement this action plan, including human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
 

Program/Schedule Adjustments: 

All programming will be provided through the 21st Century Community Learning Center funding, as allotted in the 
current grant. Lunch club schedules will be adjusted so that they can be successfully run in the cafeteria (i.e. chess, 
games club, or crochet club) and time is not lost moving to a secondary club location. HerStory and performance art 
clubs, such as steel drums, will be moved to after-school to increase practice time and improve student focus. 

Human Resources Adjustments: 

The 21st Century program will hire at least one site assistant to provide administrative support to the after-school 
program, including data collection and tracking and parent/guardian engagement. Providers will share their after-
school and parent workshop offerings during the summer of 2018 so as to avoid overlap in services and opportunities 
provided in our respective schedules. 

CSD-Admin Coordination: 

CSD will meet weekly with Principal or Assistant Principal to provide frequent updates on quality of after-school 
programming, coordinate schedules, and address trends in school attendance data. 

Community Partnerships: 

The CSD will facilitate at least one dental screening from Health Smiles provider to complement the existing 
Department of Vision’s yearly vision screening and delivery of Warby Parker glasses. In addition, the CSD will forge 
new working partnerships with the following providers: 

-Brooklyn College Community Partnership to schedule and coordinate college visits for rising 7th and 8th graders 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

-Gallop New York, a stable that provides horsemanship and riding lessons to foster community building, 
responsibility, leadership, and self-confidence. 

-Whirlpool, in order to apply for a grant to acquire a community washer and dryer in the JHS 218 school building. If 
acquired, CSD and parent coordinator will collaborate to schedule and oversee its use by the school community. 

-Additional community partnerships will be sought so as to serve student, staff, and parent interests and requests. 
Possibilities include Brooklyn Public Library, New York Public Library, Simple Stop, and New York Road Runners

Part 3c. Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following: 
1. 

Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and 
together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will 
lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.

3. 

4. 

Principal and CSD will meet on weekly basis to provide update on after-school program facilitation and attendance, as 
well as how programming can offer additional support to students who are chronically absent or severely chronically 
absent. 

The Community School Team will be recruited prior to the September 5th and will have introductory meeting during 
September 2018. Planning for the Community School Forum will begin planning stages shortly following the February 
vacation week and incorporate the forum into a final showcase to increase student and family engagement. 

All after-school supervisors will meet on a weekly basis to coordinate their services, promote and schedule shared 
community events, and differentiate their instruction so as to avoid overlaps in offered programs or events. Parent

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

 Rationale: 
An analysis of the current school year 2018 - 2019 data for English Language Learners at JHS 
218  reveals that there are currently 103 entitled ELLs  in our school (24% of total population) 
and the number is increasing daily.  The two most common languages spoken are Spanish and 
Bengali, however, we have begun to receive a significant number of students from Guyana, 
Jamaica and Haiti where English is spoken as a dialect.   
Based upon the ELLs Data Analysis Tool (EDAT), on the Spring 2018 NYSESLAT, of the 
93 ELLs who took the assessment, 4 students advanced two proficiency levels, 29 students 
advanced one proficiency level, 30 students remained the same and 2 regressed 1 proficiency 
level.  There were 62 ELLs were at-risk level three or greater,  44 were at-risk level five or 
greater, while 21 have 5 or 6 years of service.  The EDAT also indicated that our school's 
modality of strength is speaking and our modality of need is writing.  The data also showed that 
17 students scored at or below the 25th growth percentile and scored at level 1 or 2 on the NYS 
ELA exams, while 16 students in math. 
Further analysis of our data shows that 68% of our English Language Learner population are 
newcomers (0-3 years of service).  This will be our target population comprising  twenty (20) 
students are in grade 6, twenty-seven (27) in grade 7 and twenty (20) in grade 8.  We have 
identified via the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and iReady ELA assessment that these 
students need additional support in English as a New Language (ENL) and English Language 
Arts (ELA). 
The proposed program will consist of an After-school Academy with instruction in English.  The 
program will begin in November 2018 and end in May 2019. 
Days of Operation: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 
Time of Operation: 2:30 - 4:30 p.m. 
Grade levels: 6 - 8 
 
Parent Notification: 
Letters to parents notifying them of the program will be available in English, Spanish, Bengali 
and Arabic.  Parents will be asked to sign a permission slip for their children to attend the 
program.  Permission slips will be collected and filed with the Assistant Principal who supervises 
the program. 
 
Grouping for Instruction: 
Students will be grouped by proficiency levels: 
Newcomers taught by  ENL Teacher; Entering taught by Bilingual Teacher; 
and  Emerging students taught by Content teacher.  
Teachers will follow the whole (direct instruction and guided practice)-small 
(independent/pairs/groups as the teacher facilitates, supports, conferences, provides feedback, 
check for understanding, etc)-whole (lesson summary and exit ticket for assessment) 
instructional model (gradual release of responsibility strategy) used throughout our school.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Instruction will focus on academic vocabulary, grammar, comprehension skills and language 
acquisition, listening, speaking, reading, and writing. 
Materials: Teachers will develop lessons from the following materials: 
- NYCDOE - Developing Beginning English Language Learners' Strategies and Stamina for 
Academic Success in English Standards-based Units: Families, Schools, and Communities; 
Challenges and Solutions; Human Migration 
- New York ELLs Text - Continental Press 
- Duo Lingo 
- MyON - 21st Century Digital Learning 
- iReady 
- Go-Math and Ready Math Curriculum

Begin description here:            
Rationale 
Analysis of our data shows that students are still struggling with problem solving, vocabulary 
and writing.  The scores on the NYS Math and ELA exams as well as on the NYSESLAT show 
that students are still lacking the high order thinking skills and the content area knowledge to 
demonstrate mastery in assessments. Our newcomer ELLs (0-3 years) who take the NYS ELA 
test are scoring at Level 1 and are also not showing sufficient gains on the NYSESLAT. This 
demonstrates the need to provide teachers with a repertoire of ENL strategies and activities that 
will promote discourse and writing, and strategies to provide access to ELLs in the content 
areas.  Our professional development plan for the year will include professional development 
opportunities provided by CITE, the Language RBERN at NYU and iReady. They will also 
participate in other professional development opportunities offered by Fordham University or 
other entities such as the Field Support Center. Some of these activities will be part of the 
mandated block of time on Mondays as per the UFT contract. 
Professional Development Topics will include but not limited to: 
- Activities that promote discussion in the content area classroom 
- Using flexible grouping to promote student engagement 
- Formative Assessment in the Literacy classroom 
-  The Integrated ENL Co-Teaching Model 
- ENL Co-Teaching Stages 
- ENL strategies to support students' comprehension 
- The Bilingual Common Core Progressions 
- Providing ELLs access to the Content Area 
- Scaffolding in the Literacy classroom 
All ELA, Math, and ENL Teachers in the program will be offered these professional 
development opportunities throughout the entire school year. In addition to these professional 
development opportunities, teachers in the Title III Program will receive targeted PD from the 
consultant of Language RBERN at NYU. Professional Development agendas and attendance 
sheets are filed with the Assistant Principal who supervises the Program. It is our expectation 
that our ELLs will make progress and show growth in their language development and content

Begin description here:            
  
JHS 218 seeks to increase the participation of our Immigrant parents in all school activities. We 
also want to empower our parents with skills and knowledge on how to partner in their child's 
education regardless of language or ethnicity.  In addition to the CR Part 154 mandated meetings 
for parents of ELLs, the school will also offer workshops to the parents of SIFE students to 
help them understand the New York City School System.  Parents will also be invited to attend 
workshops on the attendance and school grading policies, MyON, Pupil Path, behavioral and 
academic expectations,  assessments given to students , promotional policy, connecting with 
school staff and resources, how to help their child succeed in school, etc.   
Translation will be available at all meetings.   
The workshops will be provided by the parent coordinator, counselors, school administrators, 
teachers and community based organizations. Workshops and parent meetings are designed to 
meet the interests and needs of the parents. Often these reflect community issues, young adult 
concerns and academic planning including high school selection process and college 
preparations. Parent participation is documented through attendance records. Special events are 
conducted throughout the year to support and celebrate student achievements. Parents participate 
in these celebrations as well as other cultural events conducted for parents and students together.  
Parents will be notified via phone messenger,  letters, flyers, monthly calendars in their own 
languages and by telephone. For translation of documents and/or on-site interpretation, the 
school will contact and utilize the Translation and Interpretation Unit. In addition, available 
Spanish and Bengali bilingual staff members will attend activities to assist in interpretation. 
The following workshops are planned: 
Grade Level Parent Workshops (3 sessions of 1 hour each)  - The unique needs of the middle 
school child and how parents can support them for success.  The Parent Coordinator and the 
School Administrators will facilitate. 
Navigating JHS 218s Online Student Support (MyON, Pupil Path) . Members of the 
Administration and Technology Coach will facilitate. 
Common Core and College and Career Readiness  -  21st Century and School Administration 
will facilitate. 
All About the NYSESLAT - ELL Coordinator/ENL Teachers and Administration will facilitate. 
Promotional Criteria - Administration will facilitate. 
Parent participation is documented through attendance records kept by the Parent Coordinator. 
These can be accessed by Administration.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 
At IS 218 all students are assessed in early literacy skills using a variety of assessment tools. At the beginning of the year 
students take the Scantron Performance Series reading test to preassess literacy skills.  Teachers use the results to 
differentiate, using multiple entry points and providing independent reading books for each student at his or her appropriate 
reading level. Students with lexile levels falling in the first quartile are further assesssed using the Fountas and Pinnell .  In 
addition, we administer the SIFE LENS test to determine SIFE status of our newcomer ELLS.  School-wide performance tasks 
and portfolio tasks, as part of the Code-x curriculum, are used to assess students' progress throughout the school year. 
Teacher-made assessments are also utilized in our English Language Arts classrooms to provide more individualized literacy 
instruction for all students. In addition, we will administer the SIFE LENS test to SIFE students. 
  
In addition to school-wide assessments previously discussed, literacy skills for our ELLs are assessed using ELL Periodic 
Assessments. Teachers have access to the results of the ELL Periodic Assessment.  Teachers are notified by the testing 
coordinator when the results are available. Content area teachers use the results to inform their instruction and determine 
language objectives for their ELLs. In addition, content area teachers use the results to group students, differentiate, provide 
scaffolding, and use texts and other reading resources on the appropriate level.  Another form of reading assessment is  done 
through the Myon digital reading program. All ELLs utilize the program on a daily basis. There is an initial reading assessment 
that determines the student’s reading level (lexile)and provides news articles and books on the appropriate reading level and 
challenging activities according to individual strengths and weaknesses. Teachers and administrators have access to student 
data throughout the year and monitor student progress on a monthly basis. As the students reading level improves, they are 
provided with texts on the higher lexile level.  Myon provides  assessments on an ongoing basis  so that gains in lexile levels 
are noted.   
Using  data of the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL and Periodic Assessment our school plans instruction not only during the regular school 
day but also for our Title 3 afterschool and Saturday Program.  Results help target challenge areas and inform unit and 
lesson planning.  The results also determine appropriate materials  and scaffolds(graphic organizers, pictures, technology 
support) that need to be provided for individual ELLs. 
  
When we examine the results of  assessments that determine  early literacy skills of our ELLs, we observe that  our  deficiency 
lies in vocabulary and reading comprehension. As a result, all teachers are encouraged to emphasize literacy skills in all 
content area lessons. In addition, the data on the Performance Series informs us that at least 90 % of our ELLs are performing 
at a below average reading level. Our school's instructional plan therefore calls for emphasis on academic vocabulary, 
independent reading with leveled texts, language objectives, and differentiation in all content areas. Native language support 
is provided via texts, glossaries, dictionaries, and Teaching assistants.       
     
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Our ELL team, which includes a combination of administrators, ENL teachers, and coaches, meets to discuss and evaluate the 
success of our ELL programs. We evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs by analyzing the students individual progress in 
all four modalities. Also, we analyze movement of ELLs from Entering to Emerging, Transitioning,  to Expanding and 
from Expanding to Commanding( English Proficient) on the NYSESLAT. The movement of ELLs from level 1 to level 2, level 2 to 
level 3 and from level 3 to level 4 on the ELA and Math examinations are also reviewed.  
          
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Not Applicable    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Scores on the Spring 2016 NYSESLAT show an increase in the number of ELLs in our school. In 2015 02016 this number 
increased from 59 to 86. There are currently 106 ELLs on our 2016-2017 register. Data patterns across performance 
levels(on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT) and grades reveal the following: 
1.  Nearly all newcomers score at the Entering level on the NYSITELL. 
 
2. Based on the 2016 NYSESLAT 54%(57) of our ELLs are at the EN and EM levels. 77% of these students are in the 7th 
grade. 
 
3. 25% of the current ELL population are at the Expanding level.  The number of students at this level is almost 
identical for the sixth and the 8th grades( grade 6 has 13 students and grade 8 has 11 students). 
 
4. There are 4 students that scored at the Commanding Level in our school. Three(3) of those students are in the sixth 
grade, the other is in grade 8. 
 
5. Analysis of NYSESLAT using the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) shows that 20 ELLs advanced one proficiency level but 
24 ELLs remained at the same proficiency level while 7 students advanced two proficiency levels. 
 
6. All 13 of our long-term ELLs are SWDs. 
 
7. A large percentage of our ELLs that took the NYS ELA and Math tests scored at Level 1 or Level 2 
   .  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

  Our ENL program consists of both ENL Stand Alone and Integrated co-teaching.  
Students are grouped heterogeneously for ENL instruction.  For Example, students from different language backgrounds, such 
as Spanish, Bengali, Arabic, Haitian Creole, along with English speakers, are placed in classes by grade.  Students of varying 
proficiency levels can often be found together in one class.  Based on this class makeup, we program our Integrated ENL and 
Stand Alone ENL classes. 
Students at the Entering , Emerging,Transitioning, Expanding Levels are scheduled to receive 180 minutes (4 periods) of 
Integrated ENL/ELA. In grades 6 and 7 this is done by way of our two dually certified teachers in ENL and ELA. In grades 7 and 8 
this is accomplished by a Certified ENL teacher and a Certified ELA teacher coteaching the class. Teachers using this model 
schedule common planning time once per week to plan instruction . ELLs at the Commanding level for the two previous years 
also receive at least 90 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA in our school. In addition to receiving the required number of 
Int/ENL/ELA minutes as per CR part 154, Entering and Emerging level students receive 180 minutes(4 periods) of stand alone 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

ENL. Students are pulled out by a certified ENL teacher for ENL instruction to develop English Language skills so that students 
can succeed in core content courses. 
  
 
 
 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Not Applicable   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  
Our Dual Language Program  began with our 6th grade class in 2015-2016 school year.  Preliminary statistics show that our 
incoming ELLs speak several different languages. Based on historical evidence, it was predicted that students will come from 
predominantly Spanish and Bengali speaking backgrounds. JHS 218 James P Sinnott ’s Dual Language program targets the 
Spanish speaking population. Currently there is one Dual Language class on the sixth grade and one Dual Language class on the 
seventh grade. Both classes have an ENL component designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in 
English in all content area subjects. Two subjects, Math and Social Studies are taught in the home language and English. There 
is also a home language component designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in the students' home 
language while cultivating an appreciation of their history and culture. This curriculum mirrors the ELA units for the grade. 
 We are aiming to achieve the ideal of  50% of the students  being ELLs of the same home language and 50% of the 
students being not ELLs (former ELLs or never ELLs) 
 
 
  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
 I.S 218 ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 
program model in the following manner: 
- Identify the number of students at each proficiency level per grade and per class. 
- Identify the number of dually certified ENL ,dually certified bilingual teachers and the number of ENL teachers. 
- Identify the number of periods of int/ENL/ELA needed for each class and ENL teachers are scheduled. These periods are 
identified in both ENL and ELA teachers' schedules.  Students for Stand Alone ENL are identified and scheduled for 
the mandated number of minutes and periods are programmed on the teachers schedules. 
Entering and Emerging students receive 180 minutes of ENL/ELA and 180 minutes of Stand Alone ENL.. 
Transitioning students receive at least 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of Stand Alone ENL. 
Expanding students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and the Commanding student receive 90 minutes of integrated 
ENL/ELA.  
    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

Core content is delivered by certified core content teachers in conjunction with ENL teachers. 
The Dual Language classes will receive instruction 50% in Spanish, and 50% in English.  As mentioned above, Math and Social 
Studies are taught in Spanish and English in an alternate week model. All other content area subjects are taught in English with 
home language support.   All content area instruction, both in Spanish and English, is aligned to the CCLS, providing students 
with rigorous, grade-level instruction. To assist students in Math and Science,  glossaries, bilingual dictionaries and textbooks 
in both English and the Native Language(spanish) are provided.   To establish initial literacy and differentiate to provide 
students with the best conditions to build literacy skills, teachers  provide small group instruction in the children's stronger 
language. Computer based programs, such as Achieve 3000, Myon, ThinkCERCA are used to support reading comprehension in 
both languages. 
Stand Alone:  
During Stand Alone ENL instruction,  ENL teacher uses a sheltered content ENL Instructional model, an integrated content 
language approach. The sheltered content ENL instructional model aims to develop English language skills through the content 
areas. Instruction includes a great emphasis on language development. The ENL teacher follow the ELA Code-x literacy 
program. This program has seven units that are aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards. Each unit has a theme, 
essential question, performance assessment and end of unit assessment. In addition, each grade studies two novels. The 
program is aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards and is built upon the New York State Shifts in instruction.  The 
following pillars are infused into our program:  
-Text Complexity: Students will read and be read to classic and contemporary complex texts to build knowledge across a broad 
range of subject matter. 
 
-  High-quality, text dependent questions and tasks: Students will discern the key points of text, request clarification of 
confusing ideas, ask relevant questions, and cite specific text based evidence when offering basic understanding or an 
interpretation of text. 
  
- Range and quality of texts Students will engage with and evaluate complex texts across a range of types and disciplines and 
consider multiple perspectives that represent a variety of authors and cultures.   
 
- Academic and domain specific vocabulary: Students will encounter and use academic vocabulary in reading, writing, 
speaking, and listening tasks in order to clarify the meaning of unknown and multiple meaning words, and understand word 
relationships and shades of meaning. 
 
 -Writing and research that analyze sources and deploy evidence: Students will refine and share knowledge through a variety 
of shared research and writing tasks and use relevant evidence from print and digital sources.  
 
-Native language support:  Native language support is provided in all classes. Teachers supply students with native language 
glossaries for the content areas provided by the NYS Education website.  Teachers group students with peers who share the 
same native language and are more proficient in English. Novels are available in Spanish and Bengali for independent reading. 
Our school is considering purchasing novels in Arabic, as  the population of Arabic speakers is growing. 
  
-Language objectives: In all content areas teachers of ELLs have a language objective in addition to the  content area learning 
objective, providing a literacy or grammar focus for every lesson. 
   
Integrated Co teaching 
Students in ELL classes travel to Social Studies, Science, Mathematics, Health, Advisory, and Physical Education classes. At IS 
218, all content areas are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. The sheltered content ENL instructional model 
aims to develop English language skills through the content area of English Language Arts.  She provides the ELA teachers and 
the classes with strategies and resources to use when teaching certain skills and concepts to ELL students. All other content 
area teachers receive support and professional development to assist them in providing academic rigor and support in New 
language acquisition for all ELL students. A holistic approach is taken in all subject areas, incorporating all four modalities: 
speaking, listening, reading and writing. The following strategies and methods are utilized during class lessons across all 
content areas:  

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

 -  Language objectives: In all content areas teachers of ELLs have a language objective, in addition to the learning objective, 
providing a literacy or grammar focus for every lesson. 
-  Academic Vocabulary: Students are given explicit instruction in academic vocabulary. The vocabulary is reinforced during 
academic discussions, think-pair-share activities, and writing activities among others. 
-  Balanced Literacy: A balanced literacy approach for reading is followed across the curriculum, which consists of close 
reading, independent/paired reading, shared reading, guided reading, literature circles, paired and group discussions, writer’s 
workshop, interactive read aloud, word study and teacher/student reading and writing conferences.  
-  Collaborative learning:  Students work cooperatively in all content areas. This often provides students with native language 
support and modeling. Students participate in academic discussions about a text or the content for the lesson. Academic 
discourse further supports the cultivation and reinforcement of vocabulary for ELLs.  
- Differentiated instruction: All teachers are required to differentiate for multiple entry points and different learning styles. ELL 
strategies are used to differentiate instruction, including the following: graphic organizers, native language glossaries, images, 
charts, sentence starters, paragraph frames, answer frames, building on background knowledge , tiered assignments and 
questioning, among others.  
-  Modeling and the workshop model: Teachers follow a workshop model for all lessons at IS 218, which provides students with 
explicit instruction, modeling, active engagement , collaborative activities, independent work, and discussion. 
  
  
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
  Our school does not currently evaluate students in their native language throughout the year. We are exploring the possibility 
of assessing our students in their native languages using materials now found to be available on School Net.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our instructional focus for 2016-2017 states:  "To meet the needs of all our students, differentiation is the unifying focus to 
provide multiple entry points into learning opportunities at JHS 218. Students will be able to articulate their learning goals, 
assist peers to articulate, work toward and achieve their goals". 
At IS 218, all teachers use data and student educational history to drive and differentiate instruction. This is implemented 
through intentional grouping, tiered questioning and activities, visual and /or audio aids, graphic organizers, study guides, 
sentence starters, paragraph frames and leveled reading materials using ReadWorks,Myon and ThinkCerca in ELA and 
Mathletics in mathematics.  Our teachers provide instruction that allows students to develop knowledge in a specific subject 
area through English. Teachers modify their use of English in order to make the content comprehensible. This is achieved by 
adjusting the language demands of the lessons by providing ELLs the following additional supports:   
• Modifying speech rate and tone 
• Providing direct vocabulary and grammar instruction 
• Repeating key words, phrases, or concepts 
• Modeling 
• Using visuals, graphic organizers, and demonstrations 
• Creating opportunities for cooperative learning 
• Giving students 25% native language support ( dictionaries, translations, glossaries, Duolingo etc) 
    
Plan for Newcomers 
An analysis of the data for English Language Learners at I.S. 218 for the 2016-2017 school year reveals that there are currently 
109 ELLs  in our school(27% of total population) and the number is increasing daily.  The two most common languages spoken 
are Spanish and Bengali, however,  we have begun to receive a significant number of students from  Guyana, Jamaica and Haiti 
as well as African countries such as Guinea and Ghana where English is spoken as a dialect.    
Further analysis of our data shows that 80% of our English Language Learner population are newcomers(0-3 years of 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

service).  This will be our target population comprising  twenty-nine (29) students are in grade 6, twenty-eight (28) in grade 7 
and twenty-nine(29) in grade 8.  We have identified via the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, NYS ELA  and Scantron Performance Series 
ELA assessment that these students need additional support in English as a New Language(ENL) and English Language 
Arts(ELA). 
We will utilize our Title 3 Immigrant Funds to develop a supplemental program geared towards meeting the needs of  these 
students in addition to their regular daily instruction.  The proposed program will be  a Saturday Academy. The Academy will 
begin in January 2017 and end in April 2017.  Students will receive instruction in English on Saturdays from 9:00am to 12:00 
pm.   
We will utilize  Read 180 , MyOn, ThinkCerca and other resources and materials such as: ReadWorks, Cengage 
Learning  FUNDAMENTALS vol.1 and vol. 2, and Continental's New York ELLs in preparation for the NYSESLAT.  that will support 
students on English Language Proficiency and achievement in ELA.   Instruction will focus on academic vocabulary, grammar, 
comprehension skills and language acquisition,  listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Students will be taught by certified 
teachers in ENL and ELA 
 
Plan for Developing ELLs.  
I.S. 218 offers a plethora of school-wide programs including: literacy and math blocks, common planning time, academic 
intervention services(AIS). Sinnott is also an iteach/ilearn school and each child in grades 6, 7, 8 receives a laptop computer for 
school use. Students set academic, personal and career goals and they are supported by CBO's such as Tomorrows Leaders and 
Explorers. In addition to these, Title 3 funds are used to develop supplemental programs to meet the needs of these ELLS.  In 
the After School Sessions from October to May, students are grouped by proficiency levels:  Entering/Newcomer class of no 
more than 15 students. This class is taught by 1 ENL/ Bilingual Teacher and 1 ELA Teacher.  Emerging/Transitioning Class has no 
more than 15 students taught by 1 ENL Teacher(dually certified in ELA and ENL). Teachers  co-teach using the parallel model. 
Teachers will follow the whole-small-whole instructional model(gradual release of responsibility strategy) used throughout our 
school. First, there is whole group direct instruction, then guided practice, followed by independent practice in pairs/groups as 
the teacher facilitates, supports, conferences, provides feedback, checks for understanding etc. The session ends with whole 
group lesson summary and assessment(exit ticket). Teachers develop lessons from the following materials:1.  Developing 
Beginning English Language Learners' Strategies and Stamina for Academic Success in English- Standards-based Units: Families, 
Schools, and Communities; Challenges and Solutions, Human Migration(NYCDOE) 2. Inside Fundamentals Text- National 
Geographic. 3. New York ELLs- Continental Press. 4. MyOn. 
 Plan for Long Term ELLs  and SIFE 
-Saturday Learning Center: Reading and math intervention. 
-After School Programs where students receive intensive reading and math instruction in small group setting. 
-Tutorials: These students are targeted for individualized instruction based on diagnostic tests such as running records and 
lexile testing. They are pulled out at least twice per week 
- Extracurricular activities available to Long-term ELLs  include art, music, sports, clubs, etc.  −  −  Sinnott Warriors Basketball 
Team  −   −  Sinnott Dance Ensemble  −  Sinnott School Chorus  −  Steel Band  −  The Beacon Program  −  PAL  
 
 
 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 
 Students with disabilities are provided with instruction appropriate to their IEP. Teachers and administrators meet to discuss 
student IEPs.  ENL teacher is provided access to a hard copy of a students IEP by an assistant principal. In addition, most 
students' IEP are available to teachers online through the Special Education Student Information System (SESIS).  For ENL, 
teacher pulls out students with disabilities in groups of 8 or fewer for stand alone instruction.  Instructional supports such as 
laptops, smartboards, video lessons, graphic organizers and other resources are used  by teachers to support these students. 
Additional support structures that are in place in IS 218  which are available to all ELLs including ELL-SWDs include:  
After school program – Students  receive intensive instruction  in all the modalities in a small group setting.  Strategies include: 
conferencing, guided reading, and independent reading, math skills, math problem solving. Assessed through benchmarks, 
lexile testing, and teacher evaluation.

AIS: Scheduling is determined by student and teacher programs.  
 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Our school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable diverse ELL-SWD to achieve their IEP goals and 
attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment. M 
All students with IEPs including SWDs are scheduled according to the mandated services identified in their IEPs. 
Our special education team works with the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher to ensure that all ELL/SWDs achieve their 
IEP goals. Curriculum is discussed and instructional plans are determined as appropriate. Scheduling is coordinated with 
the special needs teacher and the ENL teacher to ensure that these students also receive 
the mandated number of ENL instructional time according to their proficiency level. 
 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
I.S 218 offers intervention programs for ELLs in all content areas. AIS is offered to all ELLs in all content areas. Assistant 
Principals (Ms. Meertens and Ms. Friday) identify students  at risk of failure or scoring below a level 2. ELLs are assigned AIS 
classes.  Teachers focus on area of student difficulty.   In addition an ELL extended day program and Saturday Academy are 
offered to all ELLs to support second language acquisition and literacy. During school hours students are offered small group 
tutoring in all content areas during teacher professional preparation periods and students' lunch time.  If ELL students at risk 
fail to attend any of these interventions offered , teachers and Assistant Principals contact parents and encourage students to 
attend.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
New programs and improvements that will be considered for the upcoming school year are: inter-visitations for content area 
teachers of ELLs and ENL teacher, provide teachers of ELLs with additional professional development and individual support, 
principals further encourage and content area teachers of ELLs to include reading and writing in each lesson and visit to ensure 
implementation, look into a new beginner computer literacy program, and offer a native language arts class to students 
performing low on the LAB-R Spanish.   
Implementation of CodeX instructional routines in all content areas school wide, ThinkCerca, and Algebra for All are being 
considered.   We are also considering using Achieve 3000 and Read 180 supplementary programs to help improve students' 
reading levels. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

There are no programs that we currently wish to discontinue. The NYSESLAT and ELL periodic assessment data reveals that our 
students greatest areas of weakness are reading/writing. Our ELL extended day program  and AIS program each support 
students in improving their deficiencies in these modalities. We will continue to evaluate the success of our programs to 
ensure they provide effective support for our ELLs.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

ELLs are afforded equal access to all after school (21st century) and supplemental services offered in our building. In addition 
to the ELL Extended day  all ELLs are offered Dance and Mathematics, Martial Arts, Journalism, Basketball, Volleyball, Color 
Guard, Chorus, Chess Club,Steel Band, Visual Arts, Explorers,  and Health programs. The parent coordinator, Ms. Singleton 
provides information to parents in the preferred language to ensure equal access to all programs previously 
mentioned.   Permission slips are translated into parents' preferred languages 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 Specific Instructional materials, including technology are used to support our ELLs. Each student has access to a laptop 
computer. For native language support, all ELLs are provided with glossaries for each content area. NYSESLAT and ELA 
preparation workbooks support second language acquisition and literacy.  Beginners and students who struggle with phonemic

awareness use the Maria Calderon’s Rigor Program (a pre-literacy program). In addition, 6th grade ELLs participate in the 
Urban Arts Partnership, which provides workbooks and art supplies to support literacy in Math and ELA.  Students use Myon , a 
digital reading program, and ThinkCerca, a digital reading and writing platform and Mathletics a differentiated computer-based 
math program.    
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Home language is supported with content-area glossaries in all the languages spoken,  English/ Native Language 
dictionaries(Spanish and Bengali),  Google translate, and Duolingo are also used. In addition, teachers  group beginning 
ELLs with more English proficient peers who speak the same native language.  Our Dual Language classes receive four periods 
of Home Language  Arts support per week..  As described in another section, students in our Spanish Dual Language classes 
receive instruction in English and Spanish in Math and Social Studies. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

All teachers of ELLs are required to provide students access to the same rigorous curriculum. Students use the same materials 
as the general population in the content areas, but receive scaffolding, ELL strategies and other differentiated support to reach 
the same standards. In all of the content areas teachers support second language acquisition  corresponding to the students 
age and grade levels. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

 Specific Instructional materials, including technology are used to support our ELLs. Each student has 
access to a laptop computer. For native language support, all ELLs are provided with glossaries for each 
content area. NYSESLAT and ELA preparation workbooks support second language acquisition and 
literacy.  Beginners and students who struggle with phonemic awareness use the Maria Calderon’s Rigor 
Program (a pre-literacy program). In addition, 6th grade ELLs participate in the Urban Arts Partnership, 
which provides workbooks and art supplies to support literacy in Math and ELA.  Students use Myon , a 
digital reading program, and ThinkCerca, a digital reading and writing platform and Mathletics a 
differentiated computer-based math program.    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 
All students, including ELLs are offered an open house and parent orientation before the beginning of the school year. This is 
facilitated by the Principal, Assistant Principals and Parent Coordinator. Interpretation services and information in the parents 
home language are offered. Throughout the year, several ELL parent orientations are held for informing students and their 
parents about special programs and the curriculum.  When a new ELL is registered she/he is welcomed by the ENL coordinator 
who facilitates the identification process. Once the student is registered and placed in a  class, the Assistant Principal takes the 
student on a tour of the building, introduces him/ her to the class and provides a buddy to help support hm/her with the

transition. 
 
  
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
In 2015 - 2016 Spanish was offered as an elective for all students including ELLs.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
 Our dual language program uses the side-by -side model. 
The 6th and 7th grade dual language classes  receive instruction 50% in Spanish, and 50% in English. One classroom teacher 
provides instruction in Math in both English and Spanish on an alternate week basis. 
One classroom teacher provides instruction in Social Studies in both English and Spanish on an alternate week basis as well. 
Language separation is evident in these classrooms where half the room reflects Spanish and half reflects English. 
ELA , Science, Advisory and Gym are taught primarily in English with native language support. 
Both languages are taught simultaneously.   

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

 All ELL personnel; assistant principals, supervisors, pedagogues, school secretaries, guidance counselors, paraprofessionals, 
parent coordinator, and special providers including speech therapist, social worker, IEP teacher are included in training that 
supports ELLs  participation in school and community. Training sessions are conducted throughout the year to support each 
staff member. 
Teachers will receive professional development in the use of technology (iTeach iLearn). Adaptive and multisensory strategies 
will be explored in professional development. We will have ongoing workshops and study groups on differentiated instruction 
that will continue throughout the school year. A component will be assessment of ELL students, the academic needs of ELL 
students, as well as using data to monitor academic progress. Professional development topics have included making 
classroom teachers aware of ELL students’ academic needs.  There has also been professional development sessions designed 
to maintain open communication and collaboration between the ENL teacher and his/her content 
area counterpart.  Professional development has had, and will continue to have a significant focus on the instructional shifts 
and the connection between CCLS implementation and classroom instruction of ELLs for College and Career Readiness.  This 
includes incorporating native language scaffolds into the instructional practices.  In addition, the Common Core Standards 
emphasize the need for academic vocabulary development in all content areas  The ENL teachers will turnkey the information 
received at the workshops to other pedagogues in the school during Professional Learning Opportunities such as lunch and 
learns, grade level meetings and/or common planning periods.  Ongoing professional development is provided by the Regional 
Bilingual Education Resource Network(RBERN) at NYU. This includes individualized pd, observations and feedback, ENL 
strategies and techniques. 
More specifically, the following Professional development opportunities are planned: 
 
September: ELL Student Identification and Placement. 
  
November: "Exc-ELL-ent" Practices for the ELL Classroom (session includes differentiation of instruction, fundamentals of 
second language acquisition, questioning techniques, and addressing ELL student instructional needs)

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
To support ELLs transitioning from middle school to high school, many high school information sessions on the application process 
are provided to all 8th grade students. The guidance counselor also accompanies students to high school fairs. She also meets with 
students individually and in groups. ELLs are provided with high school information in their preferred languages. 
As per CR Part 154.2, all teachers in the school including non-ELL teachers are provided with 15% of a total of 175 hours of 
professional development in teaching ELLs over a period of 5 years. The administration has opted to use a coaching model to 
deliver this support. Using this model, the ENL teacher goes into the subject area classrooms. She observes lessons, models ENL 
strategies and articulates with the teachers. She assists classroom teachers in using ELL data as a tool to differentiate instruction 
and explains how scaffolding strategies including text re-presentation, schema building, metacognition and modeling can impact 
academic performance. She explains and/or demonstrates how Depth of Knowledge levels can be made more comprehensible to 
ELLs. The ENL teachers attend as many relevant workshops offered by the Department of English Language Learners and Student 
Support and RBERN(NYU) as possible to meet the 50% of total hours of ELL-specific professional development. 
Additionally, professional development is provided to Bilingual/ENL teachers by CITE. All professional development activities have 
agendas and attendance sheets. These are kept in binders with the assistant principal.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

To assess our school's written translation and oral interpretation needs, the Language Identification Guide is 
shown to parents so that they may find their language and identify it to school personnel. Records of the 
languages spoken by parents are maintained and accessed through ATS, Home Language Surveys(kept in student's 
files), Student Emergency Contact Cards(kept in the main office). Additionally, parents are asked to complete a 
language preference form upon registration(kept in student files) in order to quickly determine language needs of 
our parents.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          76

know that our school has 
parents' preferred 
languages for both written 
and oral communication 
are as follows" 

Spanish, Bengali, Arabic, 
Urdu, Haitian Creole, 
French, Fulani. This 
information is shared with 
the school community at 
faculty conferences, team 
meetilngs, common 
planning meetings, ELL 
committee meetings, PPT 
meetings, with guidance 
and parent coordinator so 
that translation support is 
provided when needed.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,
