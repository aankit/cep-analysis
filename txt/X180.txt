Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The staff, students, parents and community of Middle School 180 are devoted to academic excellence and the 
cultivation of individual strengths and talents in a clean, safe and supportive environment where individual 
differences and respect for the rights of others guide school and community behavior. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

The Arts are a vital component of the educational philosophy, design and program at the Daniel Hale Williams Middle 
School. The Arts provide the motivation, the challenge, the direction, the recognition, the self-esteem and the 
cooperative and authentic learning environments essential to the emotional, social, and academic success of our 
students. 

 

The school curriculum affords each student the opportunity to achieve and demonstrate high standards in many 
domains, including the arts, the academics, and major areas of athletics. Our goal for all students is to prepare them 
to become productive and responsible members of a culturally diverse global community in which they live.  

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Middle School 180 is a ‘School for the Arts’, which provides students various opportunities to develop their unique 
talents through the Arts and academics. As a ‘School for the Arts’, all students participate in one of the many talents 
offered curricula (strings, instrumental, vocal, drama, dance, music tech, fine arts, film and STEM). This Arts program 
helps reinforce the CCLS through a variety of activities such as reflection writing and critiquing. In the 2017-2018 
school year teachers worked collaboratively to revise curriculum in each subject area. One of our particular focii was 
strengthening our STEM program to better serve students who entered through our engineering program. Working in 
collaborating with OMNI Learn, Urban Advantage, Black Girls Code, Computer Science for All, to implement hands on 
deep inquiry rigorous scientific investigations. The goal is to build a program where students lead the exploration and 
apply scientific principals in mathematical agorithims in a laboratory environment. We are in the early stages of 
developing this program. In the coming year, we will be building on these relationships and forming a new partnership 
with Google in order to offer a singular STEM learning experience.  

The school continues to unify all curricula through the New York State Common Core Learning Standards and the 
school-wide Instructional Focus. All of our student populations (General ed., Special ed., and ENL) are studying the 
same curriculum, but use different points of entry. We were very excited to offer in the 2018-2019 school year four 
regents exams to all of our eighth students. (Algebra, Earth Science, U.S. History and Spanish Proficiency) The number 
of students sitting for Regents exams this year more than doubled from the previous year. Previously, 134 students 
sat for Regents exams and this year we had over 270 students sit for the exam. Additionally, we are offering the Living 
environment Regents to our 7th grade students for the first time this school year. Beginning this year students 
entering grade six will be offered to the opportunity to take a Mandarin language class taught by a teacher off site in a 
Mandarin speaking country. The words of our mission truly come alive as we continue to work to offer "opportunity 
and excellence" to every child. 

Middle School 180 is entering their second year partnership with the Middle School Qualitative Initiative (MSQI). 
Students receive Tier 2 targeted instruction from designated teachers. Currently, we have a total of 28 periods 
allotted for targeted ELA and Math instruction. Additional supports for this school year to assist teachers with 
pedagogy are the addition of a Math Peer Collaborator and a New Teacher Center Coach. Both of these individuals 
have shortened programs and work one on one with new teachers and other staff member that may need assistance 
to improve best practices.  

At the conclusion of the 2018 school year our community continued to have conversations of how our core values 
should resonate at our school. Through a partnership with Eagle Academy several staff members participated in a 
week long Professional development which focused on building school culture, school community and collaboration. 
This PD allowed our staff to reflect on our practices and our House system; in doing so a revision was made to our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

schools core values. (RISE - Resilience, Integrity, Scholarship and Empowerment) Throughout the year students will 
engage in activities surrounding the core values with classrooms and houses.  

Central to the culture of Dr. Daniel Hale Williams School of the Arts is our Academy system. Although we have 1056 
students are school is divided into four small learning communities. Each learning community is supported by a team 
of Assistant principal, Student Success Leader, Counseling staff and teacher leaders. Our goal is to ensure every child 
gets known by an adult and no child gets lost. In the coming year each academy will continue to build college 
partnerships and offer several opportunities for students to embrace their "House".  

Through our collaborations with Education Through Music and Directions for our Youth it is clearly visible to students 
that academics go beyond the classroom. We are committed to educating the whole child and continue to invest in 
expanding our ARTS programs. Offering individualized ARTS instruction, parallel programming, master classes, guest 
artist, trips and showcases.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Through the implantation of the Academic, Career and Essential Skills Program (ACES) within our special education 
classes we intend to support students classified with Intellectual Disability or Multiple Disabilities and who participate 
in NYSAA. We offer a personalized instruction to meet the needs of the individual learner. Students received 
computer training on Unique, they attended field trips based on life skills and attended the Special Olympics. In the 
coming years we are working to increase opportunities for our students to expedience real world career for adults 
who completed ACES programs.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The area of celebration for 11X180 which made a remarkable growth during the 2017-2018 school-year was teacher 
teams. Teams consistently look a student work to analyze trends, strengths and weaknesses of students. This year we 
partnered with the Instructional Focus Cohort through the district and participated in learning walks in several schools 
to gain additional insight.  

 

The area of focus for the 2018-2019 school- year will be differentiation. Our goal is to continue to offer individualized 
professional learning cycles to advance pedagogical approaches in differentiation. We will be revisiting our 
instructional focus and working as a community to see how we need to revise our practice.

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Teachers are researching, reviewing and utilizing various assessment strategies, which reflect group performance; 
with information gathered teachers are refining daily lessons and overall unit of studies. More emphasis is needed on 
comparing individual student performance to overall classroom performance. Based on the 2017-2018 NYS ELA Exam, 
the June Instructional Report, Inquiry Cycles and feedback from the IFC cohort the focus for the 2018-19 school year 
will be using of a variety of data sources including screening, interim measures and progress monitoring to inform 
lesson planning, develop explicit teacher plans and foster student participation in their own learning process.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, sixth grade students identified in the bottom third for the CCLS RI 6.1 will decrease by 3% on the 2019 NYS 
ELA exam. The implementation process will begin through conducting cycles of Inquiry and addressing the focus 
standard.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on the 2017-2018 IFC Cohort Feedback report and the Quality Review teacher team collaboration results in 
teachers sharing instructional practices that improve their instructional capacity and in teachers having voice in 
decisions that impact student learning outcomes. The focus for the 2018-2019 school year will be for school leaders 
and teachers to develop a data-driven culture based on student needs, assessments and analysis, which leads to 
strategic action-planning that informs instruction and results in greater student achievement outcomes during Tier 1 
instruction. The specific focus will be on cultivating inquiry based teacher team meetings.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, each curriculum area for all grades will conduct three cycles of standard based Inquiry using data from 
assessments (State Exams, school wide benchmarks, unit assessments) to measure student mastery of grade level 
standards. The success of the cycle will be measured by standard based pre and post test. The work will impact all 
students, but will focus on 12:1 and ICT classes through the use of differentiation.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers will utilize a “Looking at Student Work” protocol to 
gather information about student learning and inform revision of 
instructional units and task. (Inquiry), then discuss what was 
learned from student work.  

The Administrators will provide teachers with school-wide as 
well as individual student data in all content areas to improve 
students’ performance in ELA and math. They will facilitate 
professional development activities on interpreting the data and 
utilizing the information to refine curriculum units which are 
aligned with the CCLS and school wide Instructional Focus. 

Support staff will provide professional development to key 
personnel, which is turn-keyed during common planning time to 
work toward customizing instruction to be inclusive, motivating 
and rigorously aligned to the CCLS and the school-wide 
Instructional Focus. Collaborative instruction and planning will 
lend to everyone working toward a shared goal of improving 
student outcomes and preparing students for success in school 
and beyond.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
Within ELA, math, social studies and science classes students will receive a baseline exam (September 2018) and a 
mid-year benchmark exam (February 2019). This data will be reviewed by teacher teams and an action plan will be 
created and implemented, which address student weakness both horizontally and vertically. Teacher teams will use 
the data from the baseline and benchmark exams to refine units and lesson plans in order to ensure success in 
student growth. Administration will use data from teacher observations in Advance and feedback from the 
Instructional Focus Cohort sessions to target future professional learning cycles. By February 2019, 65% of students 
will show growth from the ELA baseline to the benchmark exam. A mid-year benchmark exam (February 2019) will be 
given; data will be analyzed and a comparison will be made of student growth from baseline to benchmark exams. 
Teacher teams will use the data to refine units and lesson plans in order to ensure success in student growth and 
individualized instruction based on common weaknesses found.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Data from the 2017-2018 Advance reports, Quality Review feedback, Instructional Focus cohort and school surveys 
indicate that administration provides effective feedback and targeted professional learning cycles to support all staff,. 
However, these same reports have shown that instructional outcomes should provide differentiation and opportunity 
for student’s to monitor their own growth. For the 2018-2019 school year Middle School 180 will partner with 
coaches from MSQI, Algebra for All, Omni Learn, New Teacher Center, Peer Collaborator Teachers and the DOE Pilot 
Music mentoring Program to work with staff in curricular areas. Additionally, the Leadership Academy will provide 
administration one on one coaching reflective of their observations; specifically in the areas of student achievement, 
curriculum & teacher practices; and leadership development.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, administration will conduct formal and informal observations, 1:1 weekly walks with the Principal all 
while providing teacher specific targeted feedback within 3 days of the observation and will input data into the Advance 
system. Data will be tracked weekly by the Principal and PLCs will be updated on a needs assessment basis.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 

participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Dr. Daniel Hale Williams Middle School 180, in compliance with the Section 
1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

[ Dr. Daniel Hale Williams (Middle School 180 ] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand; 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA /State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At MS 180 we evaluate students’ literacy skills through various teacher-created materials, use of quarterly exams, unit tests, 
and teacher-created exams further guide our understanding of how our ELLs learn and to determine their strengths and areas 
of need. Specifically, our ELL students’ reading skills are evaluated with quarterly Fountas and Pinnell running records which 
indicate their reading level, accuracy, fluency, comprehension, and self-correction. We use this data to communicate student 
progress, strengths, and areas of need to students and their parents via phone calls home and parent teacher conferences. We 
also use this data to target instruction for ELLs during standalone ENL (pull-out) and integrated ENL (push-in); this includes 
strategic prompting based on within, beyond, and about comprehension questions. To assess ELLs’ progress in writing, the ENL 
teacher takes students’ writing samples and evaluates them using the NYSESLAT writing rubric. Students also self-assess and 
peer-assess using a NYSESLAT rubric which has been modified with visuals and examples for a more student-friendly 
presentation. This data allows students to be more aware of the assessment criteria and helps us target writing instruction for 
the upcoming standalone ENL (pull-out) unit. We also use a differentiation matrix to target instruction for ELLs during both 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

standalone and integrated ENL. This matrix was explained and provided to each teacher during the ENL PD series. Any 
potential SIFE student is screened upon their admission to our school using the Multilingual Literacy Screener (MLS) to 
determine students’ literacy in their home language and content understandings in Math. This enables us to determine the 
types of home language supports that are needed and potential gaps in students’ instruction. Additionally, the FAST math 
initial and post assessment is used for SIFE students who demonstrate additional support in math as a result of the MLS. We 
use the standards within this intervention program to accelerate student progress towards grade-level common core 
standards in math. Our MSQI program also includes analysis of ELL student progress in vocabulary-based literacy tests. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

During standalone ENL (pull-out), the ENL teacher has integrated ELA curriculum with ENL methodology so that instruction is 
tailored to students’ needs and can accelerate their literacy so that students preview content before it is covered in class. The 
ENL teacher also meets with ELL students’ classroom teachers to discuss behavioral and academic observations, assessment 
results, student performance on content-area exams, and ways to incorporate ELL scaffolds and strategies.  During integrated 
ENL (push-in), the ENL teacher also records conferring notes and observations that are utilized for targeted instruction during 
standalone ENL. The differentiation matrix is affixed to each lesson plan with the specific scaffolds indicated. The ENL teacher 
evaluates assessment data at least quarterly and reports this information to staff and parents via email, phone calls, and 
newsletters.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
When evaluating the success of the ENL program at MS 180, the NYSESLAT/NYSITELL, ELA exam, and MSQI scores are analyzed 
for student growth by level and skill. Traditionally, the ELL students perform better in listening/speaking and demonstrate 
more need in reading/writing. Thus, ENL instruction targets reading and writing specifically in the quarterly assessments given 
to students throughout the year (i.e. Running Records, NYSESLAT writing evaluation). erefore, the ENL teacher knows that the 
returning ELL students will require further instruction to improve the area of reading/writing and prepares material to support 
those skills by levels attained (entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding, and commanding). The program is also evaluated 
on the individual success of the students in their literacy, math, and core subject areas. The individual report card grades and 
evaluation by the subject area teachers of ELL students are also used as an indication for the program's success. At MS 180 we 
conduct baseline, and benchmark assessments as well as MOSL's. The use of unit exams and projects allow the teachers to 
evaluate the knowledge the students have gained from the unit and wheat they are still struggling with. Traditionally, the ELL 
population at 180 has met the promotional criteria at all grade levels. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Teachers meet during the designated professional time on Mondays and Tuesdays by grade level and content area to discuss 
inquiry, assessments, and instructional planning. We use the Looking at Student Work (LASW) protocol to determine students’ 
strengths and areas of need and modification sheets to indicate appropriate scaffolds for students in each unit. MS 180 also 
uses MSQI, Myon, Imagine Learning, Castle Learning, and Unique to provide learning supports for students.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Not applicable since MS 180 is not a K-5 school. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We run the data reports for the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, SLAB, ELA, and Math to evaluate and inform our ELL programs. These 
indicate student progress by grade, modality, and English proficiency level. We also use the ELL Data Analysis Tool  (EDAT) to 
compare students’ performance on these exams over consecutive years, identify at-risk students, and evaluate trends in ELL 
data. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

 

At the beginning of the year, the ENL teacher met with the assistant principals and principal to communicate trends in student 
data, specifically from the EDAT and NYSESLAT report. We also conducted an initial ENL survey to determine appropriate 
targets for ENL instruction and professional development for this school year. Teachers regularly receive updates in ELL 
student progress via monthly/bi-monthly staff newsletters. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

At MS 180, we use both standalone and integrated ENL program models. We make every effort to program the 
correct number of minutes required as per the CR part 154.2 for ELL students based on proficiency levels reported on 
the RLAT. Since ELL students are spread out across different houses and we have ELLs in the ACES program, we try to 
group ELLs in the same classroom by grade. However, some ELLs are placed in other classroom based on the needs 
indicated on their IEPs. For standalone ENL, students groups are by grade and include all ELL proficiency levels. 
Activities are structured so that students are grouped by their needs, reading levels, and preferred learning styles. For 
integrated ENL, the ENL teacher works collaboratively with classroom teachers to support the ELL students. Usually, 
ELL students are seated in the room according to their academic and behavioral needs. Some ELL students with very 
limited English proficiency are paired with a student who speaks their home language as a learning support. Other 
students may be paired with a higher level proficiency student to increase their language acquisition. Classroom 
teachers confer with the ENL teacher to learn ENL strategies to assist the ELL student in their classrooms, especially 
during the ENL professional development series. The ENL teacher supports the ELL students with appropriate 
scaffolding and materials using the differentiation matrix; this includes use of manipulatives, total physical response, 
prompting, modeling and exemplars, and explicit vocabulary instruction. Instruction in all content areas is composed 
of a mini-lesson (link and modeling), active engagement, independent work, differentiated small groups, and a 
share/discussion. Students are encouraged to incorporate turn and talk, cooperative learning, and partner work 
throughout the day. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

NA: MS 180 does not currently have a TBE program 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

NA: MS 180 does not currently have a TBE program 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Our program model of ENL receives the following services: entering, and emerging students receive a minimum of 360 minutes 
of instruction per week. The transitioning, and expanding students receive 180 minutes of instruction per week. The students 
that are at the commanding level receive 90 minutes of services per week to ensure that their academic progress is on track. 
All students at MS 180 receive a minimum of 8 periods of ELA, and when programming allows we give 10 periods of ELA in 
special education classrooms. We program students according to the required minutes for the English proficiency level 
indicated on the RLAT and update this information in STARS. An assistant principal regularly meets with the ENL teacher to 
ensure that compliance needs are met. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
All instruction in MS 180 is delievered in English. The ENL teacher supports the ELL students with appropriate scaffolding and 
materials using the differentiation matrix; this includes use of manipulatives, paraphrasing, guided reading and writing, total 
physical response, prompting, modeling and exemplars, and explicit vocabulary instruction. Instruction in all content areas is 
composed of a mini-lesson (link and modeling), active engagement, independent work, differentiated small groups, and a 
share/discussion. Students are encouraged to incorporate turn and talk, cooperative learning, and partner work throughout 
the day.  Instruction is geared toward meeting the common core learning standards by taking an additive approach, building 
on prior knowledge, and assessing what the students' strengths and areas of need. There is articulation with the content area 
teachers to ensure continuity. All four ENL modalities are incorporated in all lessons (listening, speaking, reading, and writing.)  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Students may take state tests in their home language if there is a demonstrated need due to their English proficiency and/or 
parent request. We use the Translation and Interpretation services on state exams for students with low incidence languages 
so that they may have oral interpretation. For local or teacher-made assessments, staff that speak the students' home 
language may translate content or we use translation resources available online. Teachers are also encouraged to provide 
students with glossaries since these are used as testing accommodations for all ELLs on state tests. The link to these are 
provided at the beginning of the year and the ENL coordinator verifies with the testing coordinator that the necessary 
materials have been distributed and made available to students on test days.  A dictionary with direct translations of the words 
(no definitions) are also used when appropriate. Spanish LAB is initially given to students that speak Spanish after the NYSITELL 
is given by the ENL coordinator who is also fluent in Spanish. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 a.  SIFE students will be evaluated initially by the NYSITELL scores, interview, SIFE questionnaire, student work samples, and/ 
or the Multilingual Screener (MLS).  The latter assessment indicates students' specific needs in ELA, vocabulary, and math. If a 
student receives significantly below grade-level results on the MLS, the ENL coordinator and appropriate content-area teacher 
meet and determine an individual learning plan to address that specific students' needs. Particularly, if the Math results are 
low, the student may receive instructional supports drawn from the FAST math program which is specifically designed to 
accelerate math skills for SIFE students. Applicable students receive modified materials, strategic grouping, and differentiated 
assessments so that they may be appropriately supported in the Math content area. For literacy, students with significant 
needs below grade level receive guided reading and phonics instruction to accelerate their reading skills. This approach is 
based on the Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI) system by Fountas and Pinnell which strategically and gradually addresses 
literacy needs. The ENL coordinator also creates an Imagine Learning account for all ELL students and monitors students' 
progress throughout the year.b.     Based on the results of initial literacy assessments, literacy needs (especially in phonics, 
comprehension, vocabulary, sight words, and fluency) are specifically identified for each student and monitored for progress 
throughout the school year. Newcomer students are especially provided with more scaffolds and learning supports at the 
beginning of the year to facilitate a smooth transition to the target language and lower the affective filter which may be 
presented as a silent period. Some of these supports include instruction and translation in the students' home language, 
vocabulary and sight word flash cards with picture correlation, and explicit phonics instruction for letter recognition and letter 
sounds. Students are also guided in participating using methods that are appropriate for their proficiency level according to 
the differentiation rubric, such as pointing, gestures, and yes/no questions.c.      ELL students in the program with more than 
three years are programmed to maximize their regular classroom minutes so that they can be fully integrated in classroom 
experiences. Content area vocabulary is emphasized during standalone and integrated ENL to support their literacy 
development. Students are also made aware of the NYSESLAT criteria since the ENL teacher explicitly teaches them the rubric 
so that they can peer and self-assess. Additional reading and writing strategies appropriate to the grade level and curriculum 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

are incorporated such as annotation, chunking, paraphrasing, and outlining.d.     ELL students in the program six years or 
longer may be provided with specific individual learning plans to address those who are indicated as high-risk on the EDAT. 
These students may be provided with additional ENL minutes to target their specific areas of need. The ENL teacher also uses 
portfolio assessment so that students can evaluate their own work and monitor progress in their goals. This helps students see 
how their literacy has progressed from year to year so that they can strategically work on their areas of need. e.     All former 
ENL students continue to get test modifications for two years following a score of commanding on the NYSESLAT. The ENL 
teacher will provide 90 minutes of services for the next two years in order to ensure they receive adequate learning support. 
The ENL teacher offers office hours to students for homework help and other academic support. For the next academic year, 
the ENL teacher is planning individualized instruction for each commanding student as per the Alternative Pathways to 
Support Former English Language Learners' Language Development and Academic Progress.     
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 For ELL students with disabilities, differentiated activities are provided based on the baseline assessment, Spring NYSESLAT 
scores,periodic assessments and needs outlined in the student IEP. After reviewing test scores and IEP mandates students are 
placed in the class setting with supports outlined in their IEP's. Students are also part of the ENL pull-out/ push-in program, 
receiving services in accordance with their NYSESLAT/ NYSITELL test results and their IEPs. This approach is the most 
individualized. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
When ever possible the ENL periods are scheduled during the students' elective/ arts periods in order to cause a minimum 
disruption to the students' academic schedule. Standalone ENL incorporates arts elements so that students are still getting arts 
enrichment.  At our curriculum meetings, we discuss possible differentiation strategies. This year we incorporate 
differentiation in each lesson plan as a team to provide options for low, middle, and high performing students. 
Paraprofessionals are also strategically incorporated in lessons so that we maximize instruction for all students, including small 
strategy groups. At IEP meetings, teachers meet and discuss student progress which may lead to students being placed in less 
restrictive environments. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All students, including ENL students who - based on their NYS Math, ELA, MSQI scores - whom are identified as in need of 
assistance, are encouraged to attend any after school, morning tutoring or  Saturday Academy support services when they are 
available. In addition, these students are encouraged to attend the DFOY program, that will provide homework assistance to 
the students as well as support for all core subjects (Math, ELA, Science, and Social Studies). After school instructional 
programs are staffed by certified content area teachers. The students use programs for additional support such as Imagine 
Learning, Castle Learning, Unique and Myon. The intervention provided to students help foster both academic and language 
needs. We also create individual learning programs for students who are significantly below grade level. These programs are 
integrated during students' regularly scheduled content area classes.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In the upcoming school year, we will emphasize the use of Imagine Learning as a learning support within literacy. This will 
included progress monitoring and phone calls to communicate student goals and performance. We will also have the 
Alternative Pathways in place next year to improve instructional supports for commanding students. Depending on the 
distribution and flexibility in scheduling students, we may also incorporate regular literacy intervention (Fountas and 
Pinnell's LLI method) in the regular ENL schedule. This year, we also piloted a Language Ambassadors program for ELL student 
leadership and advocacy which fosters students' social and emotional growth. We plan to expand this program to other 
multilingual students outside of our ELL population to promote a more culturally responsive and aware learning environment. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

MS 180 has not had a bilingual program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are encouraged to participate in any and all academic, athletic and social programs that are offered during and after 
the school day. They are encouraged to participate in DFOY (an afterschool program that supports academic enrichment and 
supports social skills building).  MS 180 offers programs such as soccer, step team, strings, band, arts program, library 
leaders program and project boost programs.  Also, the ENL teacher provides parents and students with a bimonthly 
newsletter which details activities, events, and resources available in our community. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
At MS 180, the ELA department has a curriculum that they created that includes units of study designed using backward 
design. These units support the four modalities of the NYSESLAT as well as supporting and building on ELA content 
understandings. Some technology sites that we encourage our students to use are  Imagine Learning, Castle Learning, Unique 
and Myon, Starfall, Khan Academy, and abcya. Smartboards, iPads, and computers are also used in classrooms to provide 
visual supports, hands-on learning, and auditory learning. Class sets of laptops are available for use, as well as access to the 
technology rooms when needed.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

At MS 180 there is no TBE or Dual Language programs. For the ENL program, Spanish-speaking students are assessed with the 
Spanish LAB and may receive translations, home language instruction, or books in their home language depending on their 
performance. However, since we only have an ENL program, the language of instruction is English and home language supports 
are gradually released throughout the school year to encourage students' English language acquisition. There are also many 
Spanish speaking paraprofessionals in the building who offer their time to aid students that need home language support. The 
use of home language glossaries are available to the students as well as material in the content areas.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The ENL teacher provides all staff with ENL strategies and materials throughout the year during the ENL professional 
development series which included a differentiation matrix, ENL methodology, data analysis,  integrated curriculum design, 
and differentiated assessment. Teachers indicated the specific areas within ENL in which they needed support the initial ENL 
survey which was used to structure the ENL professional development series. Whenever a new student enters the building, the 
ENL teacher connects with the receiving content-area teachers and ensures that they have the materials needed to support 
the ENL student. The ENL teacher also provides office hours and essential information in the monthly/bimonthly newsletter to 
staff to ensure all require services/resources support and correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
MS 180 is not a co-location school. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
New ELL students are provided with a student-led tour of the school and a buddy in order to help them adjust to the new 
environment. This is part of our Language Ambassadors program initiatives (i.e. Welcome Crew, Buddy System) which will be in 
full effect next year. There will also be a newcomer packet of resources by content area available to students so that they have 
the basic concepts and vocabulary in each content area. This incorporates an instructional resource shared by the district ENL 
Think Tank. During our orientation and back to school events, we also provide interpreters for families so that they can 
communicate in their home language. We use both on-site staff and the Translation and Interpretation services to facilitate 
this communication. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

 

Currently, our school only offers Spanish language classes. However, in the upcoming year, our principal plans to begin a 
Chinese language program elective.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

There is currently no dual language program offered at MS 180. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
At the beginning of the year, the ENL coordinator sent out an initial survey to determine staff's understanding of concepts and 
needs within ENL. From this data, the ENL coordinator and administration developed a professional development series 
targeting those identified areas of interest and need. This series also incorporated data and findings from reports and analysis 
made at the very beginning of the year. The ENL coordinator also regularly attended ELL Liaisons meetings and was part of the 
District 11 ENL Think Tank group, specifically working with other district leaders in the area of ENL Instruction. The ENL 
coordinator and other staff attended other ELL PDs offered by the RBERN and other city-wide organizations. In the ENL 
newsletter, the ENL coordinator provided PD opportunities and summarized PDs attended for staff.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
As mentioned, the ENL coordinator sent out an initial survey to determine staff's understanding of concepts and needs within 
ENL. From this data, the ENL coordinator and administration developed a professional development series targeting those 
identified areas of interest and need. The professional development series and opportunities met the professional 
development requirements as per CR Part 154. The ENL coordinator and other staff attended other ELL PDs offered by the 
RBERN and other city-wide organizations in order to stay up to date on compliance and programming needs. The records of 
professional development sessions are maintained in the professional development binder maintained by our school's 
administration. On-site ELL PD materials are also kept in the ENL compliance binder. Teachers on an individual level, maintain 
their own professional record that includes any PD they have regarding ELL achievement/growth.  
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
MS 180 provides annual individual meetings with the parents of ELLs to discuss the goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. The 
ENL teacher updates parents on student progress by calling or meeting with them during the parent engagement time. We 
also had a beginning of the year ELL parent orientation so that parents could learn about the ENL program offerings, meet the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

 

new ENL coordinator,  and meet other parents within the ELL community. Translation and interpretation is provided as parent 
meetings as needed by on-site staff and the Translation and Interpretation Unit. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents of all ELL students are encouraged to join the PA which meets monthly. During the school year these parents are 
invited to join in with their children and the school community to participate and celebrate in various academic and social 
events. Such activities include literacy, math, and family nights. Parents are notified of these events via newsletter, notices 
sent home, and phone calls.  The parent coordinator plays an important role in the success of the PA and any parental 
involvement within our school. She serves as the liaison between the home and school community.   
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
A few selected ELLs participated in the Black & Latino Caucus field trip, District 11 CEC Legislative breakfast, IFC Symposium, and 
the student leadership conference at the Tweed Courthouse. One was honored at the Dominican Consulate this year for their 
outstanding leadership and academic performance. We also established the Language Ambassadors program at our school this 
year which is designed to bolster ELL student leadership and advocacy. Students met all three goals outlined in their action plan 
which included hosting a multicultural day, multicultural field trip, and a multicultural movie night. We also acquired more home 
language resources, translated IEPs, a Welcome System, and a Buddy Crew as part of these initiatives.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Marlon Williams, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The Home Language Survey we receive from the child's previous school (or from our school in the case of new 
admits), serve as our starting point. We also assess home language through ATS and discussions with our 
students' parents. The teachers provide the administration with information and feedback regarding their 
students as well. Due to our school’s historically low ELL demographic, the majority of family's at our school prefer 
to receive written notices in English. If and when it is needed, correspondence via written letters and oral 
translations are done with the assistance of staff members, and parent volunteers who speak the language as well 
(mainly Spanish). If we find translation and / or interpretation of another language is needed, our school will 
utilize the interpretation hotline or interpreters will be called in on an at need basis.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

School staff will reach limited-English-proficient families in the event of an emergency via telephone call from a staff 
member that speaks their language as well as Robocall.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.

Teachers are made aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 through meetings and turn key presentations 
employees that have attended the LAC meeting. The teachers are told about the interpretation line and given a flier 
with information on how to provide interpretation services for these families when needed 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

At M.S. 180 we believe in the importance of ensuring that all Limited English Speaking parents are provided with a 
meaningful opportunity to participate in and have access to programs and services, which is critical to their child's 
education as described by the Department of Education. In this regard, the school determines the primary language 
spoken by the parent of each student enrolled in the school and whether the parent requires language assistance 
within the required time frame. As described, the school provides interpretation services for parents at group and 
one-on-one meetings such as parent conferences upon request to ensure all parents communicate effectively with 
the school regarding critical information about their child's education. The parents are given a copy of important 
documentation, such as the "parents bill of rights" in their native language when needed. Signs are posted in the main 
office regarding parents’ bill of rights, interpretation notice signs and plans in their native language as well.  

 

 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parents have a welcoming and open dialogue with the teachers, administrators, and parent coordinator and usually 
feel comfortable sharing their feedback on all things school related through PA meetings, letters, or visits/ meetings 
with the school. That can happen at any time throughout the school year as well as during scheduled meetings and 
conferences. At MS 180 we encourage the parent survey to be filled out to inform the school of any adjustments and 
changes that the parents feel we might need to make.
