Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

HSLI students and staff thrive on responsibility and teamwork. We support and challenge each other to discover new 
knowledge, to innovate, and to express ourselves using new language. An emphasis on self-expression, literacy, and 
discourse prepares our learners for success in college, career, and beyond 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

High School of Language and Innovation (HSLI) is a newcomer high school co-located in the Christopher Columbus 
Campus in the Bronx. The school currently enrolls 350 students, almost 80% percent of whom are newcomer English 
Language Learners (ELLs). Approximately 55% of the school’s population speaks a native language of Spanish, while 
the other 45% speak languages as diverse as Bengali, Arabic, Albanian, French, English, and Chinese. The school’s 
instructional methods and college-readiness focus emphasizes student responsibility, collaboration, and literacy in all 
aspects of learning. The school has had a partnership with two CBOs, Bronx Arts Ensemble and Korea Tae Kwon Do, 
for five years, and has used these organizations to offer a wide variety of arts and physical education opportunities for 
all students. The school has also partnered with College Now for three years, and has over 20% of students in 11-12th 
grade attending courses through this program. In addition, the school has partnered with the Department of 
Education's College Access for All Program, AP for All, and LINCT for All.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The school has several special student populations: one is over-age Students with Interrupted Formal Education 
(SIFE), whose specific needs include literacy in both their native languages and English, as well as gaining background 
knowledge in content areas. Another subgroup are ELLs who enter school below a 3 rd grade reading level, whose 
needs are reaching commencement-level reading comprehension and writing in less than 2-4 years, depending on the 
year they entered the high school. Another subgroup are Hispanic male students who historically have had a lower 
graduation rate than the overall school graduation rate. .  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Progress in Framework for Great Schools.  

 

Rigorous Instruction: The school tripled the number of students enrolled in AP level courses by doubling AP Spanish 
Enrollment and added the courses of AP English Language and AP Environmental Science.  

 

Strong Family-Community Ties. The school shifted the focus of parent meetings and included multi-lingual parent 
presentations round high school and college-level student goals.  

 

Collaborative Teachers. The school strengthened its departmental teamwork by building the capacity of teacher-
leaders and creating strong protocols for common planning and having all teachers complete a mock Regents data

Key Areas of Focus:  

Supportive Environment and Trust. The school made strides in this area by hosting a series of student-led assemblies 
focused around sharing culture and building trust. However, there is still a disproportionate number of Hispanic and 
Middle Eastern males being removed from classrooms or suspended.  

 

Rigorous Instruction and Effective School Leadership. While enrollment in advanced courses improved, the school still 
has a disproportionately low number of Latino students passing Regents exams compared with peers from other 
cultures.

The school will use its weekly Professional Development period to 
address specific strategies around supporting all students, with a 
focus on students in the Hispanic sub-group. Professional 
development activities will include structured protocols for looking 
at student work, modeling and use of video to see specific effective 
teaching strategies including the use of mixed review and 
independent learning opportunities.  

All teachers will administer two mock Regents. In department 
teams, teachers will analyze mock Regents results and disaggregate 
results to see areas of need in the performance of Latino students. 

-- Each administrator and Peer Collaborative Coach will do a series 
of coaching/ non-evaluative visits to classrooms in-between 
evaluative observations in order to ensure teacher next 
instructional steps are being implemented. Coaching will include 
modeling, co-planning, looking at student work together, reflective 
conversations, and written feedback.  

-- The effectiveness of professional development and coaching will 
be monitored and tracked with student data in weekly department 
chair meetings with administration.  

Strategies that address ELLs:  

Teachers will pre-teach vocabulary and offer multi-lingual resources 
to support content and textual understanding.  

Students will memorize high-leverage academic vocabulary in order 
to support reading comprehension of texts and word problems.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program.

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. High School of Language and Innovation , in compliance with the Section 1118 
of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

High School of Language and Innovation will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           43 

 

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

The school will host an ESL after-school program on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:30-5:30 
from October 2018 to April 2019. The program will target Entering ELL students in grades 9-11 
and provide direct instruction in Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills, academic language 
that supports content areas, and classroom discussion language that gives beginner ELLs entry 
points into classroom discussions across content areas.  There will be 3 groups of students with 3 
ESL teachers providing the service.  One section will target Entering-level SIFE students while 
the other two sections will target Entering level students who are not SIFE.  There will be a total 
of 52 class sessions.   
  
Language of Instruction: Instruction will be provided in English, with native language support 
resources, as well as teachers familiar with some of the students' home languages in order to 
provide further support.   
 
Teachers will indicate student attendance on a roster created with the targeted students' names 
which will be looked at by the assistant principal and stored in a binder in her office.   
 
Materials and resources: The main materials and resources used will be from the Bridges literacy 
program for the SIFE students while the Interchange series will be used for the Entering non-
SIFE classes.   Bilingual dictionaries and online programs will also be used to support students, 
including the Duolingo program.   
 
Parents will be notified of the program with letters, text messages, and phone calls that include 
translation into their home languages.   
  
Number and Types of Certified Teachers: 3 ESL-certified teachers, 1 certified ELA teacher.

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses several assessments to guide instructional planning for our ELLs: the reading and phonics inventory from 
System 44, a literacy program; teacher-created assessments including Common Core Aligned writing rubrics; departmentally-
developed interim assessments based on Regents Standards.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           55 

 

 

The school has daily common planning periods for teachers create assessments in teams and analyze them, as well as an 80 
minute block of professional development to analyze assessments.  The school also has an assessment analysis tool that all 
Regents teachers use to analyze interim assessments and guide next steps for ELLs.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Summative assessments include the Regents Exams, NYSESLAT, and final exams developed by departments.  Benchmark 
assessments include unit tests and mock Regents exams given periodically throughout the year.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The school has programming and instructional structures in place to address summative data.  The school has various small 
group intervention programs including System 44 to address decoding teams, a numeracy course to address pre-Algebra skills, 
and a writing support course for Emerging ELLs.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
NA 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The school uses the following outcome assessments to evaluate and inform our ELL programs:  NYSESLAT, Algebra Regents, 
Global Regents, U.S. History Regents, ELA Regents, and all science Regents Exams.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The school has a weekly Department Chair meeting in which this data is disseminated to Department Chairs, who then share it 
with their departments.  The school also holds weekly or sometimes daily Guidance meetings to use this data to adjust student 
programs and open new courses as necessary.  The school also publishes data on its Google site for staff to view and use to 
make adjustments to programs or instruction.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The school offers both integrated and standalone ENL courses.  Integrated ELA is offered at every grade level.  IN 9th 
and 10th grades, students are programmed into a 90-minute ENL/ELA block that is co-taught by an ENL and 
an ELA teacher.  Integrated ENL is also offered in the following content areas: Algebra, Earth Science, and Global 
History.   
 
In most courses, ELLs are grouped heterogeneously (mixed proficiency levels).  However, in some high-needs courses, 
Entering and Emerging ELLs are grouped homogeneously to support language acquisition.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The school ensures that ELLs are programmed with the mandated number of instructional minutes by providing professional 
development to the guidance and programming team around CR Part 154.  Guidance and programming staff then program all 
ELLs for the mandated number of minutes, which is then reviewed by administrative staff and the ELL coordinator.   
  
All students receive the mandated number of standalone ENL and ELA.  Entering ELLs receive 540 minutes of ENL instruction 
via Integrated ELA, another integrated ENL course in a content area, and standalone ENL.  Emerging ELLs receive 360 minutes 
of ENL via one unit of study in standalone ENL and one unit of study in Integrated ELA.  Transitioning and 
Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL in a content area.  Commanding former ELLs also receive one unit of 
study of Integrated ENL and other appropriate services.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
All core content is delivered in English with native language supports in both multi-media and text resources, as well as 
instructional methods that provide opportunities for students to express initial understandings in both English and their native 
language.  All instruction is Common Core aligned and accounts for the Staircase of Complexity in order to provide scaffolds for 
English Language Learners.  The school utilizes sentence frames in every course in order to foster language 
development.  Additionally, the students work with a variety of adapted texts in order to make content comprehensible.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

      All major content tests are available to students with native language supports. Tests are translated into Spanish when 
possible since this is an accomodation that is available in State exams, and bilingual dictionaries and glossaries are available for 
students who speak lower incidence languages for which the State does not provide lower incidence exams. Also, additional 
tests, quizzes or assignments are translated at the discretion of the teacher/department, depending on whether the 
assignment is more geared toward developing or assessing content knowledge or the development of academic vocabulary in 
English.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. SIFE students are grouped heterogeneously in their content classes to ensure that they are provided with a range of 
supports from their peers, including native language assistance. They also receive small group support courses where literacy 
foundations are developed.  
b. Newcomers are placed into classes where there are native language supports whenever possible. They are encouraged to 
work with students who share their native language in addition to meeting students who must use English to communicate 
with them. Whenever possible, native language resources and translations are provided to support content learning. 
Instructional outcomes related to learning social and academic language are provided to these students to support their 
English development. 
c.Developing ELLs are provided instruction in English with supports that include sentence frames, adapted texts, and

opportunities for discussion, as well as native language supports when necessarily.   
d.Long term ELLs are provided with resources and supports to ensure their language development and content knowledge 
acquisition.  Group work with students at higher levels of English acquisition also provide assistance to those students who 
have remained in service for a long period of time. 
e.Former ELLs work with materials appropriate to their level of development to both challenge them and foster College 
Readiness levels of development. They engage with materials of each discipline and provide guidance and instruction to their 
peers. Additionally, former ELLs are afforded transitional accommodations in testing situations when appropriate.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers compile databases of resources for content development in a variety of formats. Students have access to video, print, 
audio, and other multimedia resources to further their development as learners. Resources and lessons are available online, 
linked through the school website, so that students can continue their learning outside of school or during independent work 
time. These resources are available in multiple languages and across the full range of levels to provide access to curriculum. 
English materials are also written and developed in multiple forms to provide students with multiple opportunities and 
pathways to accessing content while developing their English abilities.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
English language learners with disabilities are grouped heterogeneously with students without disabilities.  Students are 
reading for 15 minutes aloud daily in each class with their peers, which builds their English proficiency, social skills and helps to 
achieve their IEP goals.  Students with IEPs are given the opportunity to conference with a general education and special 
education teacher at a more frequent rate in order to help them reach the goals on their IEPs.  Students receive extra 
conferences in classes that are co-taught or classes where a special education teacher provides SETSS services in the general 
education classroom.  Since these services are provided in the General Education classroom students are able to receive them 
in the least restrictive manner whether it is an ICT class or SETSS.  As a school we use a combination of SETSS and ICT services 
to make sure that each student is in the least restrictive environment for each subject area while still receiving enough support 
to meet their IEP goals and also attain English proficiency.. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The school offers small-group support courses in ELA and math. SIFE students are enrolled in a 3-period literacy support class 
and numeracy classes.  Entering and Emerging ELLs are enrolled in supplementary ENL and Algebra support classes.  The school 
also offers small group instruction as part of our classroom instructional model as an intervention.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    
The school is going to create a program of ESL and arts integration ito the content areas to support students further, 
particularly in science and social studies.  This will be done via co-teaching and interdisciplinary units.  The school will also 
further its SIFE support with a SIFE Bridges class targeting early literacy and background knowledge.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

NA 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to any and all school programs. They are members of our campus sports teams, and have the 
freedom to choose elective courses and enrichment courses that are appealing to them, regardless of linguistic abilities. 
Enrichment opportunities available to our students through parterships with Bronx Arts Ensemble and Korea Tae Kwon Do. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           58 

 

Through Bronx Arts Ensemble, our school offers elective courses such as: Hip Hop, Fashion Design, Guitar, Keyboard, Chorus, 
African Dance, sculpture and visual arts. Additionally, our school's student council is an opportunity for ELL students to take 
leadership roles in the school community. In terms of instructional programming, all class groups and student groups for small 
group instruction are created heterogeneously. Grouping students in this way ensures that students of all language levels and 
backgrounds have equal access to opportunities at our school.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The technology being used to support ELLs includes several software programs including Castle Learning, Newsela, Learning A-
Z, System 44, and Brainpop. Students have individual accounts to these programs so that they and their teachers can track 
progress and use the software in order to support class work. These programs are used both as interventions and supplements 
to classwork so that students are able to engage in differentiated work outside of class time. Our teachers also have access to 
document cameras and laptops in order to provide visual support for lessons and create engaging lessons and project 
opportunities for students. Our school has also purchased ipads to be used during student group work for translation, 
research, and visual support purposes in order to ensure efficient completion of high level work. One of our goals for our 
students is for them to become literate in many different forms of technology and through teacher use of different mediums 
to present lessons as well as student access to various forms of technology, our students are being exposed to many different 
kinds of and uses for technology in the classroom. 
  
 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is delivered through the availability of bilingual glossaries, bilingual dictionaries and translated lesson 
materials and study guides. Our classroom libraries also include native language sections so that students are able to maintain 
their reading in the native language and students are encouraged to visit both the campus library and the public library for 
greater text availibility in languages other than English.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Our school uses a cohort model, so for core content classes (Math, Science, English, Social Studies) students are in classes 
based on their grade level. Our elective classes mix grades so that students have opportunities to interact with students of all 
ages and choose some of their courses. Twenty percent of our students are overage, and are grouped and travel through 
school with a cohort according to what year they entered our school and what credits exist on transcripts from former schools 
and countries. All classroom libraries and materials exist at varied levels so that regardless of students age and grade level, 
they have access to a wide variety of texts.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The school's campus council meets weekly and coordinates efforts to ensure that ELLs needs are met.  ELLs are able to take 
courses across the campus such as music or AP courses.  ELLs also are part of a Campus Student Council.  The campus also has 
community-building culture events for students and families of which ELLs are a part.  The campus also collaborates on ELL 
advocacy events such as a collaboration with the New York City Immigrant Coalition to provide workshops for students and 
families.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
HSLI offers a new student orientation in September to welcome new students and their parents to the school and acclimate 
them to our instructional model. We provide advice for preparing for school, ways that parents can help, and general 
information from school staff. The orientation is conducted in English and Spanish.

To support new students and ELLs throughout the year, they are paired up with returning students as mentors. Additional 
support comes from communication with parents and after school office hours provided by teachers.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

NA 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All teachers at HSLI receive a daily period of professional development during a 45 minute common planning daily. This time is 
used by teachers to share their best practices, lesson ideas, look at data, and curriculum development focused on the Common 
Core Learning Standards.  In addition, teachers receive weekly professional development for 80 minutes around supporting 
ELLs in the Common Core Learning Standards.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Teachers receive weekly professional development for 80 minutes around supporting ELLs in the Common Core Learning 
Standards.   The administration plans professional development to ensure that 50% of the professional development for ENL 
teachers is focused around ELL-specific instruction, and that content area teachers receive at least 15% of professional 
development around ELL strategies.

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Guidance counselors do outreach to all parents and work with the bilingual parent coordinator to ensure that all parents have 
either a face-to-face meeting or a phone conference regarding their child's results and language development.  

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

ELL parent involvement at our school includes various activities. Our parent coordinator and teaching staff are very 
communicative with ELL parents via phone and in school meetings so that ELL students our always supported both in and out 
of school. Also, ELL parents participate in School Leadership Team meetings, special parent dinner/information nights that our

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Julie Nariman, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The Home Language Survey is used to determine home languages for incoming students. For students who have 
already been tested or are coming from the 8th grade, the parent coordinator and counselor use SEMS to 
determine home langauges and send out timely welcomes, orientation, and information in parents' home 
languages. ARIS and ATS are also used to determine home languages. All of this is used whenever communication 
is sent to parents so that translation needs are met. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

During professional development on September 6, 2017, all staff will be made aware of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 
and the school will share them resources that they can use.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

The parent coordinator is aware of and oversees that these documents and policies are both posted, available, and 
living in the school's interactions with parents.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The school will use a brief survey on the text message system "Kinvolved" asking parents about their satisfaction level 
with translation services.  

 

Based on parent feedback the school has provided parent meetings that target specific languages and are headed by 
staff who speak those languages, so that parents can ask questions about the school in a setting in which they are 
comfortable.
