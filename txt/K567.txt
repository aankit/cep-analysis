Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Brooklyn Theatre Arts High School is a cohesive, vibrant learning community dedicated to college and career 
readiness and the development of young people with integrity, a strong sense of identity, and an awareness of the

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Brooklyn Theatre Arts High School (BTA) is a cohesive, vibrant learning community dedicated to college & career 
readiness and the development of young people with integrity, a strong sense of identity, and an awareness of the 
world and their place in it. BTA graduates demonstrate our core values of Benevolence, Trust, Attitude, Honesty, and 
Scholarship. They leave our school independent, confident, and well-prepared. BTA offers a challenging but 
supportive academic program, daily classes in theatre arts, and myriad extracurricular opportunities. We partner with 
Roundabout Theatre, Hip Hop Saves Lives, and College Confident to insure that our students experience well-rounded 
educational opportunities and are prepared for higher education upon graduation. BTA serves 400 students, all of 
whom are young people of color, and more than 80% of whom qualify for free and reduced lunch. Our students live 
primarily in some of the most challenging neighborhoods in New York City, including East New York, Brownsville, and 
East Flatbush. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that the community we provide at our school is one in which they 
each will thrive.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

22% Special Education Students, several from very restrictive D-75 settings. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Because we serve a high-needs student population, we work hard to create and sustain a compassionate, welcoming, 
and socially just school community, and of The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools, we excel as a 
Supportive Environment. An Area of Celebration after both PPO visits corroborates this: “The school’s approach to 
culture building, discipline, and social emotional support results in an inclusive culture that is conducive to student 
and adult learning.” However, this is also an area of our school that we want to continue to build upon and strengthen 
during the 2017-18 school year, and our plan for this is outlined in our Goal #2 below. 

 

Effective School Leadership is an area in which we made substantive progress during the 2017-2018 school year. In 
her fourth year, the Assistant Principal of Instruction and Principal facilitated weekly teacher/administrator meetings 
(TAMs) so that all teachers met weekly with either the AP or Principal. This structure insured timely feedback for 
classroom observations and also provided teachers with a means for asking questions, suggesting ideas, or 
reciprocating feedback. We have sustained and strengthened this practice this school year, with targeted teacher 
goals and weekly observations followed by both in-person and written feedback. The AP of Operations took on a 
much more assertive and broader role leading our discipline protocols and procedures this year, including data 
tracking for deans’ referrals. Danielle Duffy, our LEAP apprentice, was outstanding as a member of our Cabinet. In 
addition, we hired a new Dean of Students and strengthened our merit and demerit system through Skedula / Pupil 
Path. We regularly mediate and practice restorative justice to mitigate student suspensions. As a result, Principal 
Suspensions for the 2016 - 2017 school year decreased by 25% compared to 2015 - 2016. Suspensions during the 
2017 - 2018 school year were by far the lowest since Principal Ward begin in August 2012, and our implementation of 
Lunch Detention as an intermediate consequence was effective. To improve the feedback loop between teachers and 
administrators, Principal Ward will be meeting weekly with our new UFT representative, Kym Zlogar, to hear ideas, 
troubleshoot concerns, and insure a more proactive, positive, and idealistic approach to continued school change. 
Additionally, weekly Cabinet meetings and administrative check-ins will help us monitor & evaluate the systems , 
structures, and goals we have in place as we plan for upcoming initiatives. More details about these facets of our 
year-long plan are outlined in Goal #2 below. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Rigorous Instruction is the focus of Goal #1 below, and it is an area in which we made substantive progress last year. 
In the past our Instructional Focus was Reading and Writing Across the Curriculum, and in June we met in teacher 
teams and outlined the scope and sequence of our College and Career Readiness Skills. Thus, teachers returned in 
September more prepared than ever before, and we have concrete benchmarks, skills, and tracking systems in place 
across grade level and throughout grades 9-12. We built on 2016-2017's Grit work to focus on Assessment and 
individual teacher inquiry plans during professional development during the 2017 - 2018 school year. In the spring of 
'18, we brokered a partnership with New Classrooms, an organization that specializes in Teach To One (TTO) 
mathematics pedagogy, and we believe that this will transform our math program. Our Common Core Algebra scores 
continue to be below 50% passing, and so this New Classrooms partnership--worth $170,000 but fully covered by 
grants--should assuredly boost these pass rates. All 9th Graders will have a double block of Algebra and rotate 
through stations on a daily basis based upon their previous day's assessments.  

Collaborative Teachers was a major goal for improvement this year, both through professional development teams 
and stronger, more data-focused grade and department teams. In 2016- 2017, our ELA ran a weekly book study on 
the 7 Habits of Highly Effective Readers, our ELA Lead Teacher facilitated professional development about how to 
teach students stronger skills to make inferences, and our Social Studies department engaged in an inquiry cycle 
devoted to improving our students’ essay writing. In 2017 - 2018, our teacher teams were stronger than ever before, 
with grade teams facilitating inter-visitations, organizing Kid Talk meetings individually with struggling students, 
collaborating to analyze interim assessment data, and conducting inquiry cycles around specific instructional 
strategies that teachers implemented across classrooms. Our goals and action plan for strengthening these areas at 
BTA are outlined below in Goal #3.  

 

While we do have some Strong Family-Community Ties, there is always room for growth and improvement in this 
regard. In 2016 we hired an outstanding new Parent Coordinator and invested in the Pupil Path software application, 
which has greatly enhanced our communication with parents. Grade Teams and Advisory also play a vital role in 
establishing and strengthening our family and community ties. We also held some terrific community-building events, 
such as the first BTA Coffee House in May that many students and parents attended. Additionally, parent participation 
in the NYC DOE Learning Environment survey doubled in April of 2018 compared to April of 2017. The Parent 
Coordinator will have a new set of roles, responsibilities, and goals for 2018 - 2019, which will include monthly parent 
gatherings / student celebrations, monthly Community Meetings for each grade-level, and opportunities to expand 
our community service offerings, as well as internships and part-time employment.  

 

Trust is something that we have spent six years developing at BTA, since Principal Ward began here. While we have 
certainly made strides and are a kind, reliable, and honest community, there is still room for growth. In 2016- 2017 we 
adopted our five BTA Core Values of Benevolence, Trust, Attitude, Honesty, and Scholarship (BTAHS). Additionally, 
teacher teams have established professional expectations and best practices among themselves to continually build 
the trustworthiness of our school community. We have a devoted school support staff member on every grade team, 
and we go to great lengths to support our students’ social and emotional growth and development. Additionally, we 
have partnered with Peer Group Connection for the 2018 - 2019 school year to build our upper classmen's leadership 
and mentorship skills, and to provide student-led advisory in small groups of 10 9th Graders.  

Overall, we continue to make strides and improvements in myriad capacities as a school. We reached 83% graduation 
rate for the Class of 2017, and the Class of 2018 is on track for greater than 80% as well. Our 2018 graduates earned 
10 full four-year scholarships and nearly $4 million in financial aid.  

Additionally, the BTA Class of 2019 is on track for at least 80% graduation rate and could potentially reach 90! We are 
extremely excited about the potential of our rising Seniors next year, which will be BTA's 12th year as a school.

The next major step is for our instruction in every classroom to match the excellence of our strong, supportive 
culture; and as our teachers' pedagogy demonstrated marked improvement in 2017 - 2018 and we had only one 
teacher relocate (very little staff turnover), we are optimistic that next year's instructional focuses on assessment, 
rigorous tasks, and individual inquiry cycles will take our school-wide instruction to that next level of effectiveness.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths of the BTA Academic Program:  

 

From Quality Review: Instructional Core 1.1: Area of Celebration 

 

Additional Findings for 1.2: Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs... 

 

"School leaders and teachers ensure that curricula are aligned to the Common Core Learning standards, State 
standards, and the instructional shifts. In addition, learning tasks consistently emphasize rigorous habits." 

 

-Design and execution of culturally relevant pedagogy. 

 

-Multiple entry points and opportunities for students to earn credit daily. 

 

-Focus on college-readiness skills across the curriculum. 

 

-Emphasis on the theatre arts and creative thinking and writing.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

-Steady Regents pass rates across subjects, including marked improvements in June 2018 in Living Environment and 
Global 

-Our Common Core Algebra Regents pass rates continue to hover around 40%, which is consistently the lowest across 
subject areas, and thus Algebra is our primary focus for the 2018 - 2019 school year.  

-Additionally, though Living Environment scores improved, our science team spent time in June revising and updating 
our curriculum, and thus we anticipate stronger scores in both January and June 2019. 
 

Areas for improvement of the BTA Academic Program:  

Rigor of tasks across classrooms, and consistency and reinforcement of administrators' expectations across 
classrooms.  

Priority needs that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section (from PPO feedback):  

"Within observations of your classrooms this year it was noted that although students were asked to work on topics 
and assignments that were appropriately rigorous, there were still uneven levels of student participation and/or 
differentiated strategies and support observed. Strengthen instructional lessons and the implementation of these 
lessons in every classroom of your school. Ensure lessons provide opportunities for all students to engage in activities 
that foster deep critical thinking and discuss. Improve upon the level of student-to-student discourse within your 
classes and ensure that each lesson provides the necessary differentiated student supports."  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, the number of students earning 10 or more credits will be 85% or higher for Grades 9 - 11, and our 
Algebra Regents pass rate will be greater than 60%.  

 

Approximately 65% of last year's BTA teachers averaged a 3 or higher for components 1E and 3C, and we had very low 
teacher turnover this year (only 2 teachers relocated). Thus, we aim to build on our already strong structural 
foundation. 

 

More specifically, Regents Goals for the year:  

 

Common Core ELA: 70% pass rate in June 2019, 50% earn College Readiness 

 

Common Core Alg.: 60% pass rate in June 2019, 35% earn College Readiness 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15 

 

 

US History: 75% pass rate in June 2018 

 

Living Environment: 60% pass rate in June 2018 

 

Global Studies: 60% pass rate in June 2018 

 

The BTA Class of 2019 will reach or supersede 80% Graduation Rate and 50% College Readiness.

By focusing on teachers’ development and the execution of 
substantive reading and writing tasks in every class each day, we 
will provide students with the active cognitive engagement and 
ambitious intellectual activity that they deserve. Our completed 
scopes and sequences for all courses have been updated and 
uploaded to the BTA Google Drive, and they are living documents 
that are reviewed and revised regularly. Additionally, 
administrators have made their expectations clear for everyday 
lesson planning, collecting lesson plans during every class visit 
and providing specific feedback on them during TAMs and in 
writing in Advance. Our partnership with New Classrooms will 
buttress the improvement of our pedagogical best practices, and 
monthly PD cycles will provide teachers with the opportunity to 
receive feedback from colleagues about their lesson plans and to 
review student work products to identify trends and make 
adjustments as necessary. These will help target the students in 
our high-needs subgroups. 

Bi-weekly classroom observations for every BTA teacher, 
followed by specific, actionable feedback and next steps. Weekly 
Teacher/Administrator Meetings (TAMs) with specific agendas 
and deliverables, utilizing spreadsheets to track teachers’ 
progress toward goals and to identify effective next steps. The 
explicit expectations and “look fors” in common practices to 
ensure school-wide movement in 3c to engage students in 
rigorous instruction are as follows:  

-opportunities for substantive reading and writing in every class 
period every day, across the curriculum 

-at least 20 minutes of sustained student time on task in every 
45-minute lesson 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          17 

 

-evidence of annotation and active, cognitively engaged literacy 
practices 

-opportunities for students to explain their thinking and support 
their stances with substantive textual evidence 

-evidence of the 7 Habits of Highly Effective Readers, particularly 
making connections, activating schema, and making inferences. 

-all of the above practices will lead to additional support and 
guidance for students in our high-needs subgroups. 

-In sum, through bi-weekly classroom observations, weekly 
teacher/administrator meetings, a professional development 
emphasis on our school-wide instructional focuses of academic 
vocabulary and argumentative writing, and effective, 
collaborative teacher teams, 75% of BTA teachers will average a 
score of 3 or higher for component 1E, Designing Coherent 
Instruction, and component 3c, Engaging Students in Learning, 
resulting in stronger credit accumulation and higher Regents 
Exam pass rates.  

As part of the NYC DOE's Teacher Leadership cohort in 2016-
2017, our teachers worked together to implement and facilitate 
effective inquiry cycles, classroom intervisitations, and review of 
assessment data for instructional improvement. In 2017 - 2018, 
we built on this progress with teacher teams that set their own 
goals and priorities and led PD sessions accordingly. In 2018 - 
2019, for the first time in 4 years, we will be able to have lunch 
at the same time for all 400 of our students, which will free up all 
teachers 5th Period for more intentional collaborative time.  

Continued facilitation of Skedula and PupilPath with parent 
accounts so parents can track their childrens’ progress and 
communicate with teachers; printed progress reports 
backpacked/mailed home every 3 weeks; continued utilization of 
the Remind app to communicate with families; development of 
new BTA website to provide information to families and initiate a 
platform for stronger communication. Additionally, in 2018 - 
2019 we have purchased SchoolCNXT, a unique smart phone 
application that facilitates user-friendly communication between 
teachers and parents. We are excited about this addition to our 
toolkit of community outreach.

Immediately: 

  Principal and Assistant Principal will meet with individual faculty members during their weekly 

Teacher/Administrator Meetings (TAM) and set goals for Marking Period 1 pass rates, January & June Regents 
pass rates, and individual instructional improvement domains. Individual teacher goals connect directly to 
school-wide CEP goals. 

  Announce and continually emphasize school-wide goals to community through faculty meetings, PA 

meetings, and student-centered school community meetings. Transparency and clarity around how we will 
reach each of these goals.  

  Weekly meetings between Administrators, Department Leads, the PD Team, and Grade Team Leaders to 

insure coherence, specific agenda items, and deliverables / next steps. 

  Targeted professional development throughout the year to insure growth of teacher leadership qualities and 

strengthening protocols for collaborative, collegial, productive teacher engagement. 

  Pupil Path Progress Reports mailed home every 3 weeks. 
  Ability for students and parents to track daily progress via Pupil Path. 

2nd Half of 1st Semester: 

  Moved to 6 week marking periods instead of quarters in order to communicate student progress to students 

and families more frequently and to help hold teachers accountable also for consistent grading updates. 

  Creating and hosting of Parent Engagement Showcases twice each semester by Grade Team to better engage 
parents in the life of BTA and provide students with opportunities to celebrate achievements. Our new Parent 
Coordinator is integral in this.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
As outlined in the opening narrative, BTA is an extremely supportive environment that boasts a vibrant school culture 
and provides myriad extracurricular opportunities to students. We worked hard to reduce our suspension rate in 
2018-2019 and succeeded (an overall decrease of 35% in Principal Suspensions), and we expanded extracurricular 
offerings and sustained robust athletic and arts programs. Both the South Shore Girls and Boys Basketball Teams won 
the 2018 City Championships! 

 

On our Quality Review for 3.4 High Expectations, our reviewer noted, "School leaders consistently communicate high 
expectations to the entire staff. School leaders and staff consistently communicate expectations to families that are 
connected to a path to college and careers. The Impact, then, is that "Staff receives training and is held accountable 
for expectations communicated by the principal and assistant principal. Families understand their children's progress 
the school's high expectations." 

 

An area for improvement in this category is outlined in our PPO feedback:  
 
"The school's approach to culture-building, discipline, and social-emotional support has resulted in a safe 
environment and an inclusive culture that is conducive to student and adult learning; students and adults treat each 
other respectfully, and student voice is welcome and valued. Continue to build on the development of this culture to 
include the relationships among staff and teachers. How these relationships develop further will depend upon the 
amount of trust you create between teachers and administrators. Continue to develop these relationships by 
remaining committed to leadership practices that foster collaboration with staff and build upon the levels of trust that 
you have already established."  

 

There are three primary areas that we need to improve in the year forthcoming. Firstly, our school-wide attendance 
rate has hovered around 82% for three years, and we need to make more diligent, focused efforts to improve 
students’ attendance. Secondly, we need to build on this year's success and continue to improve our discipline 
systems to clarify and strengthen school-wide protocols and procedures, all the while continuing to do a 
comprehensive job of tracking student behavior data. Finally, we need to continue to implement restorative justice 
practices and improve our already strong student support partnerships and programs to increase students’ social / 
emotional engagement in the life of BTA and to continue to reduce suspension rates.

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, school-wide attendance will increase from 80% in 2017 - 2018 to 84% overall for the 2018 - 2019 school 
year here at BTA.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Because relationships between staff members and the school culture as a whole have improved and strengthened 
tremendously over the past four years and participated in the NYC DOE's Teacher Leadership Program during 2016 - 
2017, we continued to expand and improve our effective, data-driven teacher teams in 2017 - 2018. We will continue 
to facilitate professional development inquiry teams focused on looking at student work (LASW), consistency of 
classroom expectations and best practices, and best practices for literacy, college and career readiness, and cultural 
relevance and engagement. Finally, Department Teams have worked hard to develop strong, Common- Core-aligned 
curriculum scope and sequences that reflect the City-wide instructional shifts and priorities, and that work will 
continue. Department-wide grading policies have been established and revised to best serve students' needs, and we 
are enthusiastic about our team-building, collaborative work in the year ahead.  

As a result of our above efforts, our suspensions in 2017 - 2018 declined by 35% compared to the previous school 
year, our Regents scores in June 2018 demonstrated steady consistency in most subjects compared to June 2017, and 
our Class of 2018 finished with greater than an 80% graduation rate, with greater than 80% of those graduates 
matriculating in college in the fall of 2019.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, by continuing to facilitate effective grade team inquiry cycles , 80% of students in Grades 9-11 will earn 10 
or more credits.

nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths:  

-Consistency of leadership: Principal and AP of Operations, both tenured, in their fifth years at the school; AP of 
Instruction beginning her fourth year of effective service.  

-Leadership excels in relationship-building, community-building, and creating a supportive, responsive environment 
for students, teachers, and families. 

-Principal is a true instructional leader and established pedagogue, knowledgeable about what moves instruction. 

-Principal has helped create a community that nurtures and supports the whole child, which has led to improvements 
in virtually every qualitative and quantitative measure the past four years.  

-Administration always keeps the needs of the students at the forefront of decision-making and priority-setting. 

Areas for Improvement:  

-Including key stakeholders, namely classroom teachers, in key decisions that affect the school community. 

-Improved follow-through on new initiatives, insuring that we invest in priorities that impact the most change. 

-More face-to-face interaction about classroom performance when delivering constructive criticism and feedback. 

-More opportunities for continuous feedback from staff. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, more transparent leadership practices with consistent opportunities for staff feedback will result in a 15 
percentage point improvement in teachers' responses on the 2018-2019 NYC School Survey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths:  

-School staff members develop meaningful relationships with parents and communicate regularly about students' 
progress, achievement, and behavior. 

-The implementation of Skedula and Pupil Path during the 2015 - 2016 school year opened the lines of 
communication and improved discourse between staff and families and the documentation of that discourse, and this 
improved in 2016 - 2017.  

-The addition of SchoolCNXT will continue to improve our discourse with students and families.  

-The Parent Coordinator is proactive, responsive, and a true member of the community as a graduate of South Shore 
High School. Thus, he is attuned to the needs of our students and their families. He is also an assistant coach of the 
boys basketball team.  

85% positive responses from parents overall on the 2017 - 2018 School Survey 

Areas for Improvement:  

-Attendance at Parent / Teacher Conferences and other school-wide family events.  

-More consistent positive outreach to families regarding student behavior and performance.  

-More opportunities for families to get involved in the BTA community in intentional ways, e.g. volunteering 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, by communicating more regularly with and providing opportunities for families to get involved in the life 
of the school more intentionally, we will increase our positive parent responses on the 2018 - 2019 School Survey to 
>90%.

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in 
DOE systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

I believe that 
we have 
approximately 
35-40 
students in 
temporary 
housing at 
any given 
point in the 
school year, 
about 10% of 
our student 
population.  

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

Parent Coordinator and Social Worker regular check ins, provisions such as school supplies and clothing. 

 

Part B: FOR NON-TITLE I SCHOOLS

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Brooklyn Theatre Arts High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title 
I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 
Brooklyn Theatre Arts High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48

children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Paste response to questions here:  All of our students take the Fall New York City Baseline Assessments in ELA, periodic 
assessments and about 3 to 4 teacher-created  Interim Assessments during the school year. Based on these assessments we 
will be able to assess the writing skills of our students in English.  All students are enrolled in a Saturday morning program that 
offers students practice with the 4 skills: Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing. These results provides us with data 
regarding their ability to read and understand, and which we then use to help guide further instruction and develop 
differentiated materials. 
  
At our weekly inquiry meetings teachers share data on students with the ELL teacher, Ms. Florestal-Zizi.  We use the data on 
students to adjust instruction as well as to plan interventions when necessary.  Data from exams like the NYSESLAT, the New 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

York City Preassessments in ELA as well as data from the classroom is used.  Teachers and the ESL teacher use inquiry spaces to 
share concerns about students and instructional strategies that work.       
   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Paste response to question here:  ANSWERS  FOR NUMBERS 1-8:  REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF THE ASSESSMENT DATA 
  
 To assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs, we use ongoing assessment to track students’ decoding, reading levels, fluency, 
vocabulary and comprehensions skills. 
Our teachers use the ELA balanced literacy program.  After analyzing students’ results on the NYSESLAT, we realize that 
students show the most progress in the Listening and  
Speaking modalities.  It is in the Reading and Writing that students show the least progress, causing them to remain at the 
same level over time. This can be attributed to the fact that social language acquisition happens early in a child’s life when 
they are most receptive to language learning.  With this in mind, in order to improve the reading and writing of these students, 
further academic interventions are put into place within the classroom: 
Extra teacher support  
Individualized conferring 
Small group instruction 
9th period program (Extended Day) 
Reading/Writing Projects 
  
Further assessments such as found through the guidance office and using Skedula are analyzed to target skill-based instruction 
in the classroom.  This discussion focuses on Academic Language learning as well. 
The ENL teacher assesses individual student progress in order to plan using ESL methodologies that can be successfully 
incorporated to deliver differentiated instruction. 
We will continue to utilize the data from the NYSESLAT and the ELL Periodic assessments to better address students’ 
weaknesses and to further align instruction to strengthen these deficiencies.  The ENL teacher will implement strategies to 
include text-structure analysis, previewing for prior knowledge, vocabulary introducing and comprehension skills in literacy. 
Our Push-in model this year will provide instruction and programs to build collaboration with classroom teachers, professional 
development for teachers, small 
group/differentiated instruction and after school programs. 
  
Furthermore, we believe higher student achievement can be fostered by nourishing the mind and body of children through 
rigorous academic instruction and being open minded to other cultures. 
    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to question here: 
N/A    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

Paste response to question here:  2) The NYSITELL helps the ESL teacher to understand what modalities the students are 
excelling in and what most students are struggling in. NYSITELL data for our newly admitted ELL shows that this student has 
few fluency issues, but struggles to comprehend text.  Literacy skills need to be improved as well as language skills.   
  
The NYSESLAT similarly informs us of the areas that students are mostly struggling in.  BTA has ELLs at all proficiency 
levels.  There is no one continuous pattern other than this.  Each student has their own instructional plan and has their own 
unique skills to work on.   
  
The New York City Preassessment in ELA tells  us that ELLs are struggling with academic text.  Their basic skills and level of 
vocabulary impede them from performing well in the content areas.   
  
This has informed the ENL teacher instruction by having students read leveled texts.  Also, as an instructional goal, the ESL 
teacher has laid out a plan to get ELLs reading appropriately at their grade level.  Tests show this, that students struggle with 
the reading and therefore struggle with the writing.  The ENL teacher includes read alouds of fiction and non fiction texts as 
well as content area texts.  This is done daily for each student to help them improve their listening and reading skills and in 
turn their writing.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students are groueep by proficiency levels into freestanding ENL class with our ENL Teacher. There are no more than 
2 contiguous grades in each class. Entering and Emerging ELLs are placed into the stand alone ENL class. In this class 
the ENL Teachers works with the students on improving their academic language skills across all content areas. All 
ELLs are placed into integrated co teaching classes with a content Teacher and an ENL Teacher. 
  
Instruction is provided by a duly certified teacher using a Push-in Model in heterogeneous classes where the Content-
area teacher and the ESL teacher use the Co- teaching/co-planning strategies.  This year, ESL instruction is a Push-in 
Model.  The push-in is achieved by providing ESL methodology with the ESL teacher in Core subject classes. ESL is used 
in the content-areas to build Academic Language while pushing in and co-planning with the teachers. Currently, the 
school offers Standards-based curriculum in required core subjects and semester-long theater-arts 
electives.   Students are heterogeneously grouped in classes to ensure inclusive classroom settings with students of 
different interests and abilities.   
  
The ESL students are provided with Regents-Prep classes and content-area tutoring during the 9th Period program. 
The ENL teacher works with core-subject teachers to ensure that we include essential language development in our 
planning.  In this way the ESL teachers co-teach with classroom and content area teachers, sharing best practices for 
ELLs, scaffolding their instruction, building on vocabulary, using visuals and hands-on activities to help activate prior 
knowledge and working in small groups while meeting the full mandate for advanced students of 180 minutes and 
part of the mandate for beginners and intermediates.  The full mandate of 540 minutes for beginners, 360 minutes for 
Intermediate ELLs, and 180 minutes for Advanced ELLs is completed during the 8th  period, and during the after-

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

school (9th period) program.  The ESL teacher attends grade meetings and other faculty sessions to monitor student 
progress and integration of ESN strategies.   
  
To support our ELLs, we provide a buddy system, and libraries within the school and the classroom containing multi-
level, multi-cultural books.  We also have a Language para- professional, Ms. Pradel, who floats to provide assistance 
where needed.

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              Paste response to questions here:   Students are grouped by proficiency levels into fresstanding ENL class with 
our ENL Teacher. There are no more than 2 contiguous grades in each class. Entering and Emerging ELLs are placed into the 
stand alone ENL class. In this class the ENL Teachers works with the students on improving their academic language skills 
across all content areas. All ELLs are placed into integrated co- teaching classes with a content Teacher and an ENL Teacher.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                Paste response here:  Since this school only has a freestanding ENL program, all content instruction is delivered in 
English. The ENL Teacher works closely with the content area Teachers in planning instruction so that it is accesible by the ELLs. 
In addition, all ELLs have access to content specific glossaries and dictionaries in their home language. Materials that are more 
accessible to the ELLs which include visual representations of vocabulary, and more simple text samples.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                Paste response to question here: All classroms contain culturally relevant and Native Language books for the students 
in their home language. Their Native Language reading levels drive instruction and planning.      
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Paste response to questions here:  
 SIFES 
  
Although we currently have no SIFE students, the practices we would use could include a thorough pre-assessment of literacy 
needs and skills in alignment with our New York State Standards.  Once needs are determined their oral language would be 
encouraged using QTEL strategies that effectively accommodate students at all proficiency levels. 
We would incorporate the SIFE’s native languages and prior knowledge, and include scaffolds such as visuals, graphic 
organizers, experiential learning, TPR and role-playing carefully differentiating the content, process, and product.  We would 
also provide bilingual books and curriculum materials in our library as well as content-area books written at lower levels and 
without diluted information. 
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

NEWCOMERS (WITHIN 1 YEAR) 
  
Pushing into the ELA class, the ESL teacher is able to work in small focus groups providing specific scaffolds.  This would include 
using story boards, role playing, and practicing a story orally before writing it. At our school, newcomers are partnered with 
more advanced students who act as interpreters to check comprehension. 
Newcomers are encouraged to read with a student partner and they use prompts to develop oral language and push 
comprehension. 
  
ELLs RECEIVING 4-6 YEARS OF ESL SERVICE: 
  
The NYSESLAT data has revealed that our ELLs on the Extension of Services report and receiving 4-6 years of ESL service need 
more work in reading and writing.  To drive best instruction practices, the data used is not restricted to the NYSESLAT or the 
ELL Periodic Assessments.  Concerning reading, the ESL teachers also conduct and share with classroom teachers about the 
ELLs’ strengths and weaknesses according to formal and informal assessments’ results. We have targeted our bottom third for 
focused reading group during the 9th period at the end of the school day. During theses times, we will be working on 
deconstruction language, and various writing projects throughout the year involving expository NYSESLAT writing, as well as 
research-based writing. 
  
LONG TERM ELL’s  (COMPLETED 6 YEARS)   
  
According to our data, our long-term ELLs are also students who are not successfully dealing with the increased demands of 
reading and writing.  In addition to all the reading and writings strategies employed for the ELLs on our Extension fo Servides, 
we are striving towards ways to increase motivation and engagement.  Some of the ELLs in this subgroup are part of the focus 
of our Inquiry Team.  This work involves classroom observations and more focused skill- assessment.  These students will 
benefit from these findings as we look to implement the work of the inquiry Grade Teams as we witness successful strategies 
in action. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Paste response to question here:  
 ELLs WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 
  
The ELL students in our school that have been identified as having special needs, are discussed at monthly meetings so we can 
supervise their general education progress by monitoring and addressing their needs and they applying strategies and 
interventions to scaffold their learning.  Teachers of ELL-SWDs use graphic organizers and other scaffolding materials when 
designing instruction for content area classes. The Grade teams in the school provides the ELL Coordinator and content area 
Teachers with additional ideas and materials to target each ELL-SWD's classifying condition.  
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Paste response to question here:  Paste response to question here:  
The ELL Coordinator works closely with the ICT Coordinator  to create an action plan that best serves the ELL-SWD's language 
and IEP needs. ELL-SWDs are programmed first to ensure that their language and IEP needs are being met. The ELL Coordinator 
and ICT Coordinator work closely together with the ELL-SWD's Teachers to ensure that instruction is effective for the particular

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Paste response to question here:  
  
The ELLs at our school are included in many intervention programs for ELA and Math.  Intervention is also available in the 
content areas as it arises during the school year.   
The ELLs develop analytical thinking skills for reading more complex text, but also be increasing their background knowledge 
for writing.   Instruction includes guided and partner reading, including books and reinforcement of skills learned in the 
classroom. 
Our former ELLs are benefiting from our push-in model, as they are grouped with current ELLs and native speaking students on 
the grade.  As the classroom teacher and ESL teacher co-teach, strategies such as focused speaking prompts around a strategy 
taught, partner reading, and small group conferencing to name a few, are available for them as well.  The ESL teacher keeps a 
close watch on them to ensure continued progress. 
  
The ENL Teacher sits in the Grade/Inquiry Team with a teacher in each of the content areas and can push in when further 
neccesary. The ENL Teacher plans lessons with the content area Teachers to specifically target the skills where our ELLs need 
additional instruction . Class Assessments are also desgined to be able to identify the high-needs skills in each content area. All 
Teachers follow the 3-tiered response to intervention model.

Our ELLs may participate in all test prep offerings primarily taking place during the school day and after school.  Our ELLs 
partake in regular programs that enhance their learning experience. Like all our students they are presented with and get to 
choose from a progressive range of learning situations to develop their talents based on their strengths and interests. 
Staff that speak the ELL's home language are availbe for interpretation at all school events. In addition, ELLs are invited to 
particpate in all school programs through the use of school staff that speak their home language. When ELLs are at school 
events, they work closely together with their ENL Teacher and other staff that speak their home language in order to fully 
participate.

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

  
HOW IS NATIVE LANGUAGE SUPPORT DELIVERED IN EACH PROGRAM MODEL? (ESL only) 
  
We offer an ESL program as per parental choice.  Although instruction is primarily delivered in English, we 
carefully consider Language literacy and encourage its development.  Our school library possesses bi-
lingual and mono-lingual reading materials in our dominant languages such as Haitian-Creole and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

Spanish.   
Educating the parents is also a top priority so that they understand the transference of literacy skills.  The 
ESL services closely support and correspond to the ELLs curricular (by age and grade), linguistic, and 
affective needs. 
  
At this time we do not have a program to assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school 
year, as our intake commences on the first day of school.  
However, we strive to make our parents feel welcome at the school by presenting information whenever 
possible in the home language, and maintaining a open foor policy from the start.  We refuse to allow 
language or culture to be a barrier to a student’s learning at our school.  We keep in constant contact 
with our ELL parents by phone and in writing.

development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Paste response to question here:   
The education of children is a collaboration effort between school and family.  We encourage this development as a way to 
broaden our students' educational experience and strengthen parental support and participation in all areas of our school. 
Parent Orientation meetings are held periodically during the year as new students arrive. Department of Education DVDs are 
shown to ELL parents addressing parent-options in several languages at these meetings. 
After January Regents week, the ELL Coordinator invited all parents of ELLs to come to school for a mid year summary and 
debriefing. Parents have the opportunity to ask any questions about their student's progress and the programs that the school 
provides.     

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.

4. The standard DOE translation document is attached to important letters sent home. This document informs parents 
that the information attached is important and they should have it translated in their home language. 

5. We use DOE translation services provided through the telephone at (718 )752-7373 and/or we translate messages 
sent via our School Messenger Service using staff members as translators (where needed).  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The parents have unlimited access to the school, the Language Access Coordinator and to the Parent Coordinator. The
