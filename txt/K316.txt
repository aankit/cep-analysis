Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The school’s mission is to ensure that children leave P.S. 316 with a set of moral values and social-emotional skills that 
encompasses self-esteem, open-mindedness, resilience, and a sense of community; a complement of standards-based 
reading, writing, and thinking skills across curricula; and an appreciation and respect for cultures and diversity in our 
school community and in the global world. We strive to nurture a community of students who are critical thinkers and 
problem solvers with discriminating minds on a quest for knowledge. We focus on developing the whole child, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

academically, cognitively, socially, emotionally, and physically. We value the partnerships that exist between our 
school, our families, and our community at large.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The school community includes 550 students from pre-kindergarten through grade 5; of which 73% are Black, from a 
range of backgrounds, 20% Hispanic, 5% White, and 1% Asian students. Boys account for 53% of the students enrolled 
and girls account for 47%. The neighborhood community and our school are experiencing demographic change. The 
administration strives to adapt to those changing needs. Five diverse classroom settings, including ASD NEST, Gifted 
and Talented, ICT, Dual Language, and General Education are offered so that we can meet the needs of a wide range 
of learning types. As an International Baccalaureate Candidate school, P.S. 316 provides a globally minded framework 
by which to support a rich and robust curriculum. Authorization from the International Baccalaureate Organization is 
expected during the 2018-2019 school year.  

One of our school’s most significant partnerships is with NYU in building our ASD NEST program for students with 
autism spectrum disorder. The entire school benefits from the expertise and best practices of that program. Other 
valuable partnerships maintained are with arts and mentoring groups, including Community Word Project, Visual 
Thinking Strategies (VTS), NOBLE (National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives) Mentoring, Alvin Ailey 
Dance Residency, El Sistema Music Program, the NYC Parks Department Swim For Life swim instruction program, and 
CUNY/Creative Arts Team Student Shakespeare Festival, One Planet-Distant Learning, Community Counseling and 
Mediation (CCM). These partnerships bring a wealth of resources and experiences to our students and families. 

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The student body includes 4% English as a New Language Learners and 21% special education students. The specific 
needs of our ENL student population is that our ENL students receive mandated small group instruction from our ENL 
teachers. Our Special Needs population ( ASD Nest) students receive support for speech and language, occupational 
therapy, and physical therapy to improved their academic, socio-emotional and physical growth. Our ASD NEST 
students also attend social club to support them with their social and emotional growth. Our SETTS students receive 
support in ELA and Math to supplement goals, which are set on their IEPs. Our Gifted and Talented students are 
taught using an additional enrichment curriculum based on Gifted and Talented criteria and standards to support 
their academic needs. In addition, the implementation of project based learning is facilitated by teachers to foster 
critical, independent thinkers. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

This past year, our school has made the most progress in three of the five elements described in the Framework for 
Great Schools. We continuously strive to enrich and sustain a Supportive Environment in the school and classroom for 
our students. Our RTI Team has focused closely on Personal/Behavioral needs, utilizing PBIS and Academic needs, 
with support from AIS. We engage all cohorts within the school community, including School Aides, Paraprofessionals, 
Learning Leaders, Office Staff, Kitchen Staff, Security Staff, and Families, as well as Instructional and Administrative 
Staff, to explore and practice positive (vs. punitive) and nurturing interactions with students. We have continued to 
improve and expand our success within the area of Collaborative Work Among Teachers. Our internal Teacher Inter-
Visitation Program (TIVP) has a new and expanded cohort, in which teachers observe other teachers’ best practices, 
and explore "Critical Friend" approaches. Our School Leadership has expanded and grown. The Leadership has been 
providing direct Professional Development to the staff, working on building stronger more effective team rapport and 
productivity through the discussion of changing from the language of complaint to the language of commitment. Also, 
the Leadership involves the staff in administrative decisions by building capacity through an Instructional Cabinet, an 
Administrative Cabinet, and a Hiring Committee. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

For the coming year, we have two key areas of focus, the first of which is Rigorous Instruction, again, because we 
believe this is so highly important, and because it requires constant attention to sustain our growth and improvement 
in this area. We also will continue to focus on deepening our Strong Family-Community Ties. In conjunction with our 
move toward the International Baccalaureate approach. We believe that in order to better understand and 
participate in the global community, we must also know ourselves, our own community.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
The school has worked hard to maintain the overall school rating on 2014-2015 Quality Review of Well Developed.  

 

One area, of continued focus is in the QR domain of 1.2 Pedagogy. The observed strength in this area is that “across 
classrooms teaching practices are aligned to curricula and reflect the belief that students learn best when engaged in 
collaborative experiences around rigorous tasks “(QR, p. 3). An additional strength, as noted in the Quality Review, is 
that there are “multiple opportunities for students to engage in conversation with their peers around tasks” (QR, p. 
3).  

Based on our 2017 ELA State Exam 55% of students met state standards (a 13% increase from 2016 of 42%). Our 
continued focus is to increase the number of students who achieved a level 3 or 4 and decrease the number of 
students who achieve level 1 on the NYS ELA exam. Based on the 2017 Math State Exam 57% of students met state 
standards (a 14% increase from 2016 of 43%) Our continued focus is to increase the number of students who achieve 
level a level of 3 or 4 and decrease the number of students how achieve a level 1.  

 

The identified area of need is to improve the extension of student thinking. This is observed in our school assessments 
as well as on the Quality Review. “Prompts for students were not strategic enough to extend their thinking. Student 
notes revealed similar and low level responses, one word and short phrases, which limited their agency over planned 
follow up conversations” (QR, p.3). Our instructional focus this year is to continue to support our students with 
engaging in high-quality discussions, exemplified by students working collaboratively to construct their own meaning 
through inquiry based learning that support investigation and reflection through the International Baccalaureate 
framework.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

By June 2019, all teachers will facilitate student- structured, guided and open inquiry based learning that will result in at 
least 60% of students performing on a Level 3 as measured by a standards based rubric.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
1. Beginning-point Benchmark: September 2018- October 2018: We will administer, score, and analyze beginning of 
year assessment data (Fountas & Pinnell Running Records K-5). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16 

 

 

2. Mid-point Benchmark: By February 2019 at least 68% of our students will read on or above grade level based on 
the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System. Student progress will be monitored at different points 
throughout the year to determine if additional support or intervention is needed.  

3. End-point Benchmark: By May 2019 at least 85% of our students will read on or above grade level based on the 
Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System. Student progress will be monitored at different points 
throughout the year to determine if additional support or intervention is needed.  

There will be six week cycles of implementation. Progress will be monitored throughout each cycle, and students will 
be provided with additional support (morning intervention program, technology program, small group or individual 
instruction) to allow students ample opportunity to meet the set benchmark.  

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
The instrument of measure that is used to assess progress will be an Inquiry Standards-Based Rubric and Fountas & 
Pinnell. 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
PS 316 places a strong emphasis on creating an environment that nurtures the whole child, emotionally, socially, 
cognitively, academically, and physically. We want students to develop self-agency and to learn to be able to direct 
their own personal and academic growth. The classroom and school culture should allow students to feel safe, 
supported, and challenged to grow and learn. Classroom and school culture should facilitate their personal growth for 
social emotional developmental health.  

 

In order to assess the healthfulness of our school and classroom environments, we examined several data sources 
including our NYC School Performance Dashboard, our School Quality Guide (which includes School Survey data and 
Quality Review data), and our OORS (Online Occurrence Reporting System) Data Summaries.  

 

Data Sources  

The 2017 Performance Dashboard (the most recent available) indicated that our school is meeting criteria for success 
in four of the six Framework elements, and exceeding criteria in two elements.  

 

We gain a clearer picture of the environment with close analysis of the results of our 2016-17 and our 2017-18 NYC 
School Quality Guides. While we are meeting success criteria overall, the NYC School survey results show a need for 
improvement. The Supportive Environment element section of the survey has four component measures: Classroom 
Behavior, Peer Support for Academic Work, Safety, and Social Emotional. The trend for Peer Support is positive, 
indicating that students are becoming more collaborative – something that we will continue to strengthen.  

 

The other three components however, need improvement. We will focus here on Classroom Behavior and Social 
Emotional skills as they go hand-in-hand. Some of the more significant findings include responses to specific 
questions. 

 

When we examine the OORS Data Summaries, it gives us more information.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          18 

 

 

Overall, from school year 2016-17 to school year 2017-18, the number of OORS reports decreased by nearly 30%, a 
sizeable reduction. Trends in the data indicating type of incident and location remain consistent from one year to the 
next.  

 

Current Ongoing Initiatives 

We have in place multiple components that have been successful at supporting students in the development of their 
social emotional health. Our mental health center includes a school psychologist, two social workers, a guidance 
counselor, and a mental health therapist who sees children and families. Our social worker provides lessons to classes 
using the CKCC (Competent Kids, Caring Communities) curriculum that builds students’ social emotional 
competencies. We have a PBIS (Positive Behavior Interventions Systems) Team that helps create behavior norms and 
routines for our school. We have an RtI (Response to Intervention) Team that addresses individual student academic 
and non-academic needs.  

 

Current Needs 

The data indicate that while we are successfully creating a positive environment overall, there are areas that need 
improvement.  

 

1 – Classroom behavior is addressed to remove barriers to the educational process, and to support healthy social-
emotional development of our students. 

 

2 – In order to facilitate that, adults in the school will be supported and provided with effective professional 
development to promote their own personal and professional growth in this area. We strive toward an authoritative 
approach rather than an authoritarian, punitive approach. By authoritative we mean responsive to and supportive of 
children’s needs while simultaneously having high standards for their behavior and learning, and being consistent in 
setting limits and boundaries.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, we will decrease the number of Level 3 behavioral incidences in the classroom by 25% as measured by 
OORS data.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
This is a critically important component of our work to create a supportive environment and to develop healthy 
social-emotional lives in our students. We will design a series of approximately four small-group seminar workshops 
to explore effective affirmative parenting approaches. These will be collaboratively designed and implemented by the 
Therapeutic Center staff members, Parent Coordinator, PTA, NEST coaches and staff.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Teacher development and commitment to improvement is apparent across the school. According to the 2017-2018 
School Survey, 97% of teachers say they talk with one another about instruction, which indicates the highly 
collaborative nature of our school culture. In addition 86% of teachers say that they had opportunities to work 
productively with colleagues on professional development. 

Teacher development and growth has been a priority at PS 316 for the recent past beginning in the 2013-2014 school 
year, when Principal Olga Maluf identified four teachers as aspiring teacher leaders, and enlisted them into the 
Teacher Leadership Program (TLP) as the first Cohort of teachers to participate in the TLP. We are now beginning 
Cohort 5 in the TLP program, 

 

TLP is intended to strengthen content knowledge, coaching, and facilitative skills of teachers already serving in school-
based leadership roles. The program is also intended to build capacity in the building. 

 

During the 2014-2015 Quality Review, the school earned a rating of Well-Developed in QR component 4.2, 
highlighting how teachers “engage in structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that 
promotes shared leadership and focuses on student learning.” 

A great foundation for classroom teacher inter-visitation practice has been established over the course of several 
years. After the first year of the TLP, Principal Olga Maluf proposed that teachers continue the professional practice of 
peer-to-peer inter-visitations. Therefore an in-house program titled Teacher Visitation Inter-Grade Program (TVIP) 
was created, beginning in the school year 2014-2015 as the first cohort. Two teachers who participated in the TLP 
program facilitated the program. TVIP is now beginning its 5th Cohort. 

Additionally, to further expand teacher collaboration, teachers participated in a vertical IB Inquiry team, as well as 
served as mentors and coaches to their colleagues. The mentoring in our school this past year involved four seasoned 
teachers working with a mentoring coach from the New Teacher Center. These four mentors regularly met with new 
teachers to support them in a variety of ways. 

 

There was an identified need for teachers to possess greater agency to affect positive change within the school 
community. This is apparent through the school survey which stated that 78% of teachers say that teachers take 
responsibility for improving the school. In order to address this priority, teachers will be given the opportunity to work 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22 

 

with a wide range of teacher teams, as well as the opportunity to share their teams’ progress with the school 
community. This will create a shared sense of ownership and stronger invest in the school community. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 80% of P.S. 316 teachers will actively participate in teacher intervisitation, as measured by the number of 
teacher reflections of their intervisitations, and teacher logs, mentor logs and feedback from coaches/ consultants

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

For the 2017-2018 school year, we looked closely at the component average for each of the eight components 
aggregated across all confirmed observations. We also looked closely at the alignment of our teaching practice and 
our instructional focus which is Student to Student Discussion and Multiple Entry Points. The component average data 
for each of the eight components showed that teachers were Highly Effective at 18.14% , Effective at 75.23%, and 
Developing at 5.88% .School leadership has identified components 1e Designing Coherent Instruction, 3b Questioning 
and Discussion, and 3d Assessment, as areas in which teachers can improve. Since the data is based on the Danielson 
Rubric, feedback on observations as well as teacher follow up will be monitored. It is our goal to support teachers to 
improve their overall teaching pedagogy. 

School Leadership will continue to support teacher development by providing opportunities for teachers to 
attend/participate in differentiated professional development. School Leadership will provide opportunities for 
teacher inter-visitation through our in house Teacher Inter Visitation Program during the school day. Teachers will be 
provided with the coverage in order to conduct inter-visitations. Teachers will also be able to visit other schools in the 
district as well as in the city to learn best practices. Teachers will visit Showcase Schools in order to develop their 
professional goals. Teachers will have the opportunity to work collaboratively with their colleagues to plan lessons 
and units with the IB coordinator, the ULIT Coach, the TCRWP staff developers. Teachers will be able to improve their 
mathematical content knowledge and lesson implementation by working closely with our NTN Math Consultant. New 
teachers will also work closely with the NTC mentors, the ULIT Coach, Literacy coach and IB Coordinator, ARC 
consultant to set goals, look at student work, analyze student data, plan lessons and units, and to work on teacher 
reflection. Teachers will work collaboratively in horizontal and vertical teams on a weekly basis. Teachers will engage 
in action research, where they will take a deep dive into looking at data in order to create a plan of action for student 
success.  

Teachers will also be provided with ongoing actionable feedback to improve in their teaching pedagogy based on data 
from observations. School leadership will collaborate with the IB Coordinator, the ULIT Reading Coach, NTC mentors, 
the NTN Math consultant, and the Teacher College Reading Writing Project staff developers to support teachers in 
achieving next steps based on observation feedback. This growth will be measured through the data collected around, 
but not excluded to components 1e, 3b and 3d.  

Building capacity among our staff is also a priority. Teachers actively participate in facilitating professional 
development. Teachers engage in collaborative planning sessions where they are responsible for creating and 
developing International Baccalaureate units of study. Teachers are also involved in leadership programs such as TLP, 
CARP, NTC, and TVIP where they are able to support each other with improving their teaching pedagogy, as well as

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed 
to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

 

Leadership will support teachers in their endeavor to deepen 
unit and lesson planning by organizing a differentiated Monday 
PD series, with an emphasis on designing coherent rigorous and 
engaging lessons that aligns objectives, activities and 
assessments with inquiry-oriented and project-based teaching 
and learning. Leadership will provide more formative/coaching 
support and feedback regarding lesson planning to those 
teachers who request it or are in need of support in that area. 

An important element of our attention in strengthening our 
lesson and unit planning will be focused on addressing needs of 
students with learning differences and ELLs, and incorporating 
those scaffolds and multiple entry points into the lesson and 
unit plans. 

With our work toward attaining International Baccalaureate 
PYP (Primary Year Program) accreditation, we not only want, 
but need, to increase our avenues for parent engagement. 
Instruction will become increasingly transdisciplinary, inquiry-
oriented, and project based. The engagement of parents, 
families, and the wider community will be incorporated, by 
each classroom, as a significant component of at least one of 
the four transdisciplinary units of our first year of implementing 
IB curriculum.

The school will engage families by providing them opportunities to attend workshops lead by teachers, consultants, 
and the parent coordinator. Families will also receive support during the Tuesday Parent Engagement time, Saturday 
workshops and afterschool events. The workshops will take place throughout the school year. Key personnel 
responsible for implementation will be teachers, the ULIT Coach, TCRWP Staff Developers, NTN Math consultants and 
administration.

College Reading Writing Project staff developers, SETSS provider, ELL Coordinator, paraprofessionals, and school 
based support staff will support the leadership goal through the use of internal and external professional 
development resources. Common planning time will be built into the schedule in order for teachers to plan lessons 
and units together. Teachers will work collaboratively in inquiry teams to analyze data, share lesson plans, and to 
analyze student work. Teachers will be provided with coverage for inter visitations, and will attend afterschool 
planning sessions with coaches, mentors, or teacher leaders.

planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
School Leadership will monitor progress through classroom observations, teacher reflection, teacher logs, and 
teacher feedback. Leadership will monitor the rating distribution report in Advance for components 1e, 3b and 3d at 
different intervals throughout the school year. Teachers will receive actionable feedback, next steps and a follow up 
timeline in order to assess improvement in identified components. Based on teacher feedback, professional 
development will be tailored to support pedagogical need. A 55% improvement in the mid-point benchmark for 
teacher improvement in components 1e, 3b and 3d will be measured based on the evidence in Advance.  

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
In February 2019, the instrument of measure that will be used to assess progress will be observation evidence as 
measured in Advance, samples of exemplar lesson plans, teacher feedback, and implementation based on feedback.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our strengths include vibrant family and community involvement and engagement in the daily life of our school. 
Parent responses on the 2017-2018 NYC School Survey and the continuing increase in our enrollment speak to family 
and community satisfaction with our school community. Our priority need is to reach those families and students 
through a wide-range of communication, on both a school level and a teacher-family level—for example, Class Dojo 
(teacher/guardian), School AP (school/guardian), Robo Calls (school/guardian), Monthly Newsletter (PTA/guardian), 
Tuesday Family Engagement (school/teacher/guardian), PTA Google Groups (school/guardian), and through more PTA 
events and workshops.  

After reviewing 2017-2018 NYC School Survey, improving school communication, informing families of all the events 
and community resources we offer, is a very high priority need for us, no matter how many community resources and 
number of programs and events we offer to strengthen family and community ties. According to the 2017-2017 NYC 
School Survey, twelve percent of families and caregivers responded that our school needs better communication. 

This is an important area for us to focus on because while we do offer many community resources and have a 
welcoming environment for families—through Community Word Project, Scholastic Book Fair, Career Day, United 
Nations Day, NOBLE, Alvin Ailey Dance In-House Residence, NYC CUNY Shakespeare Festival, Enrichment Clubs, and 
Community Counseling and Mediation--strengthening communication will help increase the number of families taking 
advantage of our school offerings and will also enrich the civic life of our school.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, we will increase our communication outreach and parental/guardian involvement by 25% through the use 
of Class DOJO, School App, Robo Calls, Monthly Newsletters, Interim Progress Reports, and event logs as measured by 
2018-2019 NYC School Survey and a school-created parent survey.

Section 7: Support for Students in Temporary Housing (STH)  

 

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

For the 
2017-18 
school 
year, 
according 
to ATS, we 
currently 
have 27 
Students in 
Temporary 
Housing 
who are 
attending 
our school, 
which is 
4.96 % of 
our 
students. 
This 
number 
may 
fluctuate 
during the 
school 
year, so we 
will 
monitor 
the 
number on 
a weekly 
basis 
during our 
attendance 
meetings. 

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

We will provide students in Temporary Housing with the necessary supplies such as books, clothing, coats, book bags, 
school supplies and food that they need. We will also provide students and families with counseling from community 
outreach programs such as Community Counseling and Mediation (in house and outside). Families will be provided 
outreach supports from our guidance counselor, social worker, parent coordinator, and Community Based 
Organizations who can provide additional support to them.  

Our parent coordinator will work closely with the District Family Advocate to seek additional support for our Students 
in Temporary Housing. Our Community Liaison will work closely with the parent coordinator, family worker, and our 
PTA to support families in need. Our family worker will work closely with the attendance team, teachers, and 
administration to monitor student attendance and family needs. Our family worker will reach out to families who are 
demonstrating difficulty with lateness, attendance or other supports. In addition, families will be provided with 
transportation options to travel to and from school.

3. Some Non-Title I schools receive a specific allocation based on the reported number of students living in temporary 
housing.  If your school received an allocation (please refer to the current Title I Funds Summary of School Allocation 
Memorandum), include the amount your school received in this question.  If your school did not receive an allocation

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
 

Currently, all of our teachers are deemed to be “Highly Qualified.” In order to continue to recruit Highly Qualified 
Teachers, we utilize the Open Hire system. We also work in collaboration with Queens College, St. John’s University, 
York College, and Touro College. We encourage our current staff members to make recommendations. In addition, we 
receive recommendations from consultants who work with our school.  

New teachers are interviewed and view by members of our school hiring committee. The committee includes 
teachers and administrators.  

We conduct frequent observations (formal and informal) utilizing the Danielson Framework for Teaching to measure 
teaching practice. We provide timely, actionable, specific feedback to support teachers in improving their teaching 
practice. In order to build capacity, teachers we offer a variety of teacher leadership and collaboration opportunities. 
Teachers are invited to join teacher leadership groups such as TVIP, TLP, CARP, and NTC, where they can engage in 
activities such as inter-visitation, action research, planning and PD facilitation. 

We presently provide support to teachers from our IB Coordinator, ULIT Coach (K-2), TCRWP Staff Developers, NTC 
mentors, NTN Math consultant, and through intra and inter-visitations. Teachers are encouraged share best practices, 
materials, resources, unit and lesson plans to develop and improve curriculum and teaching pedagogy that is aligned 
to the CCLS.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
 

In order to provide high quality Professional Development, we have partnerships with the International 
Baccalaureate, Teachers College Reading Writing Project, Houghton Mifflin, Junior Great Books, One Planet-Distant

intervention services, etc.). 
In order to help preschoolers adjust to their new school, a member of the staff greet and assess each student who 
registers for school. A parent handbook is given to all families when they register. A family intake survey is conducted. 
An Orientation (with tour) will be given in the Spring. At this time, the administration and members of the staff will 
communicate ideas to families about how best to prepare their child to adjust to elementary school. Parents of 
incoming Kindergarten students are invited to attend PTA meetings. Workshops for new families are conducted by 
our Parent Coordinator. An End-of-Summer Welcome Visit is held in classrooms with teachers for incoming Pre-
Kindergarten students and parents.

Teachers are active members of decision-making processes. They meet in grade-level teams as well as across grades 
to discuss appropriate instruction and assessments. Additionally, we have a MOSL committee to determine which 
assessments would be used as part of the Advance teacher rating system. The SLT meets monthly to discuss the needs 
of the school and what the best methods of formative assessment, instruction, and summative assessments are for 
each student population. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 316K, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

 

P.S. 316 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 At PS 316 we use a wide range of assessments that provide data for us to analyze and guide our targeted instruction.  These 
include curriculum-embedded assessments (from Teachers College Reading and Writing Program, GoMath, and Foss 
Science).  We utilize the accuracy, miscue, and comprehension information revealed in Fountas and Pinnell running 
records.  For lower grades, K-2, we use a school-created Phonics Assessment for print concepts, letter-sound correspondence, 
phonemic awareness, rhyming, decoding, encoding, sight word recognition, spelling, and vocabulary.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

For each academic year, we create a detailed assessment calendar by grade level, addressing all subjects and student 
populations.  The SchoolNet assessments have answer docs that are scanned for scoring.  Constructed responses are evaluated 
by scoring teams which are normed prior to scoring.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We rely heavily on periodic assessments including NYC DOE Performance Tasks for ELA and Math, Performance Series online 
computer-adaptive assessments for Reading and Math, NYC DOE ELA, Math, and Science Baselines and Benchmarks, ELL 
Periodic Assessments, Estrallita, and Spanish LAB.  In addition, each year in January we administer a ‘mock’ ELA and Math 
exam and collect, analyze, and utilize the data.  This year, we are expanding and further developing our International 
Baccalaureate Inquiry-based learning approach.  For each unit, each student will create a portfolio with samples of their best 
unit work and their final unit product, and personal reflections on their learning goals, achievements, and experiences. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Scoring teams collect the assessment data, which is collated and shared with teachers, who then work in grade teams to 
reflect on the results, student needs, and interventions.  Grade level teams review effectiveness of intervention, reflecting on 
strengths and improvements needed for the interventions. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 
Academic performance data for ELLs is collected as a subgroup and analyzed for strengths and weaknesses, with the ENL and 
classroom teachers working together.  For upper grades, Item Analysis report for NYS ELA and Math assessments provide very 
granular data, as do the Fall and Spring periodic ELL assessments.  This year, we intend to also utilize the ELL micro-bundle 
assessments.  Organization of classroom instructional time provides for RtI Tier II differentiated interventions through small 
group targeted instruction.  Our lower grade and upper grade AIS teachers work in 6 to 8 week cycles with small groups of 
students who have similar targeted instructional needs. Progress is monitored with pre- and post assessments.  Grouping of 
students changes as students master the material.  RtI Tier III interventions are provided following recommendations of the RtI 
Team, which consists of AIS teacher, ENL teacher, Social worker, Guidance counselor, Administration (including attendance 
concerns), literacy coach, and student’s classroom teacher. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
          We have found assessment results databases such as those available in SchoolNet, Performance Series, NYS ELA and 
Math Strand (standard) Analysis and Item Analysis to be very powerful tools for determing student’s specific learning needs, 
and to guide our targeted instruction.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 
We will be again  forming a year-long school-wide Collaborative Action Research Project (CARP) Team to delve deeply into data 
and design effective interventions.  

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

   We have a relatively small ENL population (15 students, including 1 former ELL who receives continuing services). 
2017-18 will be their first year that we offer a Spanish-English Dual Language Kindergarten, in addition to our K-5 
Freestanding ENL program. Our school's ENL schedule complies with the new regulations in the Chancellor Regs 
regarding ENL instruction to include Stand-Alone ENL (as pull-out) and Integrated ENL (as push-in co-teaching). 
The stand-alone ENL is implemented by grouping students into small instructional cohorts, based on their proficiency 
levels and providing instruction through a licensed ENL teacher. The Integrated model follows a "Push-In" model, 
where the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher collaborate on the instructional focus and the ENL creates scaffolds 
and adaptations tailored to the specific needs and proficiency level of the student(s). Students in the Stand-Alone 
model are grouped by proficiency levels as well as in mixed proficiency levels. 
 
This will be the first year we have provided a Spanish-English Dual Language Kindergarten class. It will be self-
contained model, with EP/SLL (English Proficient/Spanish Language Learner) students and SP/ELL (Spanish 
Proficient/English Language Learner) students together for most of the day (about 75% of the day).  There will be 
some separation: while the EP students receive ELA (English Language Arts), the ELL student will receive ENL (English 
as a New Language); while the SP students receive SLA (Spanish Language Arts) the SLL student will receive SNL 
(Spanish as a New Language).  Thus, both language will be developed in all students (simultaneous model). The class 
will operate on a roller-coaster model, i.e. on Mondays and Wednesdays content will be taught in English; on 
Tuesdays and Thursdays content will be taught in Spanish, and Fridays will alternate. Colors will be used to help 
students know which is the language of instruction (red for Spanish and blue for English).

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

         Our school has added a part-time ENL teacher in addition to our full-time ENL teacher in order to provide all required 
instructional minutes to ENL students. At the beginning of the school year, the students are grouped by grade (K and 1, 2 and 
3, 4 and 5) and by proficiency levels (Entering and Emerging, and Transitioning and Expanding).  The schedule is created so that 
Entering and Emerging ELLs receive a total of 8 periods of instruction per week to meet the 360 min. per week mandate, and 
the Transitioning and Expanding-level ELL students meet for a total of 4 periods per week in order to meet the 180 minutes per 
week mandate. The Commanding or exited-out students receive 2 periods per week to meet the 90minutes mandated. The 
ENL teachers and classroom teachers confer with each other regarding instructional articulation. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  
ENL instruction is informed by standards-based content area curriculum. The CCLSs provide a strong base for the curriculum, 
especially in reading and writing. Instructional units based on all content areas are utilized – Reading, Writing, Science, Social 
Studies, Geography, Math, Music, and Art. ENL instruction follows an eclectic approach, drawing on a variety of ENL 
methodologies, such as SIOP, Sheltered English, content-based instruction, scaffolding, collaborative learning, inquiry-based 
learning, small group work, Reader’s Theater, a focus on academic vocabulary, and others. Articulation with the classroom 
teachers allows the ENL class to provide relevant support in the content areas. High quality children’s literature, both picture 
books and chapter books, forms the basis of much instruction. Guided reading, interactive writing, and a focus on academic 
language and complex text - for both reading and writing - are some of the classroom practices. We engage in Instructional 
Conversations (as described by Lily Wong Filmore) in which we deconstruct complex sentences. We then reverse the process 
to construct complex sentences in writing. 
Emphasis is placed on developing cognitive thinking skills and problem-solving through all four modalities – listening, speaking, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

reading, writing. Students learn about their brains and about thinking. We promote an effort-based learning with a Growth 
Mindset way of thinking (as described by Carol Dweck). Instruction is informed by the research and teachings of Lily Wong 
Filmore, Kate Kinsella, Elfrieda Hiebert, and Andrea Honigsfeld, among others. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  Spanish-speaking students who are identified as ELLs are given the Spanish LAB. Students who are literate in their first 
language are provided with copies of state tests (except for ELA) in their home language (when available). To ensure that 
students are appropriately evaluated in their native language, we rely on our pedagogues, staff members, and PTA members 
who are bilingual. When appropriate, we enlist the services of Interpretation vendors. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

    Differentiated instruction is a core tenet of instruction school-wide at PS 316. It is essential for learning to provide cognitive 
access to content for subgroups of all students, including ELL students. Presently, PS 316 does not have any students identified 
as SIFE, though we are prepared to address their specialized needs. A SIFE students would be administered After 
administration of the LENS assessment, a series of other assessments would be utilized to determine areas of strengths and 
weaknesses that would serve to guide instruction and delivery of RtI, intensive ENL, and AIS services. Lessons would be 
adapted to cover key information in a way that is accessible and culturally relevant, without oversimplifying it. Just because a 
student doesn’t know the language doesn’t mean s/he can’t think! Newcomer ELL students are provided with individual 
attention to help them feel comfortable and acclimate to the school routine. They receive intensive instruction in basic 
language skills such as alphabet recognition, letter-sound correspondence, decoding, and vocabulary development. 
Newcomers in the upper grades, who will be required to take the ELA after their first year, receive ELA test instruction, 
including test-taking skills, practice exams, and specific instruction in how to deconstruct the test question language, test 
format, and test materials. ELLs receiving 4-6 years of services are assigned individualized supplemental work to enable their 
progress and to prevent them from becoming long-term ELLs (6 years or more). Data from the students’ prior NYSESLAT tests 
and from ELL periodic assessments are used to provide targeted instruction to zero-in on deficient skills in the four modality 
areas (Listening, Speaking, Reading, Writing). Small-group differentiated instruction is provided during regular class time, ENL, 
extended day, AIS, and during the After-School Academy program. We currently do not have any long-term ELLs, but 
instruction for these students would include intensive Reading Rescue sessions, Fountas and Pinnell Leveled Literacy 
intervention. Long-term ELLs often possess fluency in BICS but are weak in CALP. A strong focus on academic language, 
sentence structure, vocabulary and higher level thinking skills would be provided to address these deficiencies. Former ELLs 
receive continuing ENL services for two years. They are identified to classroom teachers. The ENL and Classroom Teachers 
consult regularly to monitor former ELL progress. These students also receive the appropriate test modifications of extended 
time and re-reading of listening passages.      
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
PS 316 has a small number of ELLs with special needs (most recently, three ELL-SWD students). These students are in ICT 
classes. The ENL teacher and the Special Ed teacher articulate methodologies appropriate for the student’s grade level and 
individual needs. They share strategies for helping individual students meet their language, academic, cognitive, and 
behavioral needs. Various modes of differentiation, such as learning styles (visual, aural, kinesthetic, tactile), materials, 
grouping, technology options, and project products are used. Teachers employ instructional strategies that include use of 
visual supports, bilingual materials, use of cognates, pairing same-language ELLs, among other strategies. Grade-level materials 
that provide access to content include phonics materials, listening media, SmartBoard resources, and a rich ENL classroom 
library which contains leveled books, bilingual books, pop-up books, board books, picture books, chapter books, non-fiction 
and fiction, magazines, etc. Anchor books used with our literacy curriculum, are provided in Spanish, when available. If the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

exact title is not available, we use Spanish or other language texts of similar content. Technology used to support our SWD ELLs 
include ipads, computers, SmartBoards, and the use of GoogleTranslate app.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
  ELL-SWD students are placed in the classroom setting mandated by their IEP. Our current ELL-SWD students are placed in ICT 
classes. We have an ICT class at each grade level. This allows for flexibility in providing modifications in curriculum, 
instructional delivery, and scheduling in order to meet related service mandates, such as speech, OT, PT, and SETSS. To the 
fullest extent possible, we assign our ELL-SWD students to classes that are taught by teachers who know their home language. 
We also place students in classes together with other same-language students as much as possible.        
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 Our school supports a wide range of intervention programs, all of which are utilized with all students and are especially used 
with ELLs. Our RtI Team uses multiple sources of data to pinpoint students who need intervention and to determine which 
type of intervention. We provide targeted, small-group instruction in literacy and math embedded into daily instructional flow. 
We also have both lower grade and upper grade AIS teachers who uses a range of programs including Fontas and Pinnell 
Leveled Literacy and Wilson Reading System. Our Academic AfterSchool program, which is attended by all ELL students in 
grades 3-5, utilizes Ready and Kaplan for ELA and Math. Some students use Read 180 to improve literacy. We use a special 
online math program called ST (Spatial-Temporal) Math with lower grades. This program is a pictorial non-text program 
especially well-suited to ELLs for math concepts. Lower grades also participate in a program called C-8 ACTIVATE which 
promotes development of eight major cognitive skills (such as working memory, pattern recognition, distraction inhibition, 
etc.). This program consisits of both an online curriculum and a physical activity curriculum promoting development of these 
important executive functions. Reading Rescue intervention is provided one-on-one with Tier 3 students (included ELLs). All 
these program are attended by ELLs as appropriate. Our school maintains a deeply-held view of the child as a whole person, 
and as such we also provide strong support to the socio-emotional needs of our students, including ELLs. Our guidance 
counselor, social worker, mental health therapist, and school psychologist are all available to meet with students on an “at-
risk” basis, as needed. Further, we have built a full program of enrichment activities including extracurricular music programs 
such as cello, violin, and lunchtime drumming. We have an Alvin Ailey Dance residence program, Second Grade Learns to Swim 
program, Student Shakespeare Festival program, among others. And, we have a well-established After-school Clubs program 
with a varied menu of topics, such as chess, dance yoga, crochet, math games, sculpture, brain games, board games, 
basketball, and Spanish Club. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

           The ENL Teacher/Coordinator is constantly revising and improving the scope and sequence of the ENL instructional 
program. Currently, we are focusing on ways to continually enhance our incorporation of the CCLS, student-led inquiry 
learning, and project-based learning. We will be creating a Kindergarten Spanish-English Dual Language class during the 
upcoming school year.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

NA         
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
  Every student at our school has equal access to all programs, including ELL students. In order to compensate for any barriers 
placed by language differences, we reach out specifically to ELLs to include them in our many extracurricular activities. We 
proactively recruit ELLs for student-centered initiatives such as Lunch-time Leaders, Student Reading Mentors, a school store 
with school dollars, and Friday clubs such as Technology, Math Games, Yoga, Basketball, and Chess. Bilingual notices are sent 
home so that parents who speak another language can be informed. IN addition, our school community is participating in our 
district-wide TAC-D initiative.  We have worker toward reducing any instances of disproportionality, toward increasing our

awareness and practice of culturally relevant education, and equity for all. These are values that guide our daily practice as 
education and school community members.         
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
      We employ a wide variety of instructional materials, including Wilson Fundations, Wilson Reading System, Fountas and 
Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention, Foss Science, and NYS Social Studies Core Curriculum materials. Go Math is available in 
Spanish, and for Teachers college Reading and Writing Program, when it is possible, we obtain texts in students’ home 
language when appropriate, to allow them to more fully access the content. Our students utilize a variety of technology-based 
learning tools including SmartBoard, document cameras, laptops, iPads, listening centers, as well as online programs such as ST 
Math, OneMoreStory, BrainPop, Starfall, MyOn, AtoZ Learning, and apps on the iPad. Most classrooms have SmartBoards and 
laptops for students, and all classes have access to the computer labs. These materials provide a number of modalities for ELLs 
to access language and content for learning. The ENL Classroom library has bilingual books and books in students' home 
languages. This library is a lending library for students. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

        Our Freestanding ENL program is technically English-only. However, we believe that students are best served when both 
languages are developed. Literacy concepts developed in L1 transfer to L2. While we do not currently formally provide 
language instruction in native languages, we do encourage parents and students to continue to develop their first languages. 
We provide parents with articles and information about the brain benefits is bilingualism. When possible, the ENL teacher 
supports students’ first language to promote comprehension and meta-linguistic knowledge. Our Bilingual library in the ESL 
classroom and in the school Library (including curriculum texts) is expanding. Students are encouraged to borrow and take 
home through the ENL Lending Library. Each student receives three copies of a bilingual dictionary in his/her home language 
and English - one for home, one for the main classroom, and one for the ENL classroom. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

  All required services and resources are provided at the age-appropriate levels for all students and are closely monitored to 
ensure fidelity. We employ UDL practices in order to provide access for all students.   Additionally, we assign a staff member to 
each ENL student and family member to assist is the transition to the new educational setting. Our guidance and 
pedagogical departments are able to discern the specific needs and grade levels of our ENL students and provided targeted 
and specific interventions and supports.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our elementary school shares the building with a middle school.  The ENL teachers of both schools communicate with each 
other and share resources and information.  Some of our students attend this middle school, so a number of families are 
present in both schools.  This allows for a degree of continuity in the educational experience of students.  We have some 
students whose parents and even grandparents attended PS 316!     
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
    Newly enrolled ELL students who register before the start of the school year as well as ELLs who enroll throughout the 
school year are met by bilingual staff members and informed about school routines and programs. The number-one priority for 
newly enrolled ELLs is to do everything possible to make them feel comfortable. It can be incredibly difficult for a student to 
enter a new school, compounded by not knowing how to communicate or interact with others because of language 
differences. Our school makes it a priority for students to feel that they are welcome and belong here. All staff contribute to 
this, but especially the ENL teacher, office staff, the guidance counselor, and the parent coordinator.      
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

 In addition to the new Kindergarten Spanish-English Dual language class, beginning this year, we will offer Spanish language 
classes to all students.  Students are also provided access to the well-regarded online Middlebury Interactive Language 
program, as well as the easily-accessible DuoLingo app. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

This will be the first year we have provided a Spanish-English Dual Language Kindergarten class. It will be 
self-contained model, with EP/SLL (English Proficient/Spanish Language Learner) students and SP/ELL 
(Spanish Proficient/English Language Learner) students together for most of the day (about 75% of the 
day).  There will be some separation: while the EP students receive ELA (English Language Arts), the ELL 
student will receive ENL (English as a New Language); while the SP students receive SLA (Spanish 
Language Arts) the SLL student will receive SNL (Spanish as a New Language).  Thus, both language will be 
developed in all students (simultaneous model). The class will operate on a roller-coaster model, i.e. on 
Mondays and Wednesdays content will be taught in English; on Tuesdays and Thursdays content will be 
taught in Spanish, and Fridays will alternate. Colors will be used to help students know which is the 
language of instruction (red for Spanish and blue for English).  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our school follows a rich professional development plan. The ENL teacher participates in most trainings offered to regular 
classroom teachers, as well as specialized ENL trainings. Recent PD sessions have included presenters such as Kate Kinsella 
discussing ELL vocabulary acquisition, Andrea Honigsfeld discussing Common Core for ELLs, and the NYS TESOL annual 
conference in Toronto. The ENL teacher turnkeys the ENL trainings to the rest of the staff at faculty PD sessions, grade level 
common planning meetings, or Lunch-and-Learn workshops. Professional development for all staff who work with ELLs 
(classroom teachers, ICT teachers, cluster teachers, ENL teacher and coordinator, asst. principal, parent coordinator, 
paraprofessionals, guidance counselor, related service providers), is delivered by the ENL teacher, and other invited trainers. 
Further, teachers are encouraged to attend workshop offerings from OELL, and BETAC. Throughout the year, the staff 
participates in Inter-School Visitations, curriculum trainings, Visual Thinking Strategies training, Thinking Maps trainings, and 
faculty PDs. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
   A wide range of Professional Development opportunities are offered to all school staff members during Workshops, and Staff 
Development days, and the Monday PD time period. These events include different strategies to assist staff members in the 
instruction of academic language through content for ELLs and in oral communication for ELLs. As mentioned previously, our 
ENL teacher turnkeys her ENL PD’s to the rest of the staff. During most types of PDs, the needs of ELL students is often a topic 
of discussion. All professional development participation is recorded by the school payroll secretary, as well as through sign-in 
sheets and agendas. Our UFT representative helps ensure that teachers are aware of their ELL-related PD requirements.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
  We believe that strong relationships with parents and students provide the greatest benefit for our ELL students. We foster 
these relationships through specific outreach to parents of both ELL students and non-ELL students whose parents speak a 
language other than English. The ENL Teacher creates a schedule of annual individual meetings with conference records and 
follow-up actions to be taken. This is to ensure that parents are engaged in their child's schooling. Over-the-phone translation 
service from the DOE has proven exceedingly useful. We also utilize the Google-Translate app as needed.      

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

We plan workshops describing ways parents can help their children. We encourage use of the Dial-A-Teacher Helpline, 
available in numerous languages. Our Parent Coordinator and our PTA work together with ENL to promote events and involve 
ELL parents.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Olga Maluf, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In order to assess our school's written translation and oral interpretation needs for our parent community we 
collate information from several  
sources. We use the ATS Home Language Report (RHLA) to determine Home languages used in students’ homes, 
and we use the info 
rmation from the Home Language Identification Survey, the Blue Card, and the Parent Language Preference Form 
for parents’ specific language preferences for written and oral communications.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

a school emergency.  
 

we have a voice blast system that translates into different languages as well as a school app that also translates to the

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

During our September initial conference all teachers and staff members review all the Chancellor Regulations and we 
specifically review A-663; additionally all staff members are provided with a handbook with copies of all the 
regulations. Staff members must attest that they have read and understood all the Chancellor Regulations presented 
at the conference. All staff members are informed of the various resources available as well as designating the 
appropriate point person and assistant principal that provides additional support and guidance.
