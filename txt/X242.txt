Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Mission Statement: Mott Hall is dedicated to provide a nurturing, quality education emphasizing Mathematics, 
Science and Technology that will guide 6 th through 12 th graders to higher educational opportunities and lifelong 
success . 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Unique/Important Characteristics of School: Founded as part of the replication model, Mott Hall V has the essential 
features of rigorous academics, advisories, school uniform, and with a focus on Math, Science and Technology. We 
have been a school for the past 6 years working on blended instruction towards our goal of a 1 to 1 student to 
computer ratio. While finishing our 11 th year this year, the school’s expansion to a 6-12 was only first completed in 
2014.  

 

Collaborations/Partnerships: Mott Hall V currently partners with multiple CBOs in order to support the school in 
meeting its mission and vision. We are a College Bound Initiative (CBI) school which provides us with a full-time 
college counselor and resources to prepare students for their next steps after high school. In the middle school we 
also partner with Sports and Arts in Schools Foundation (SASF) to provide enrichment and support activities after the 
school day ends. Other partnerships include Lehman College with both the College Now and GEAR UP programs, 
Dream Yard, and the National Outdoors Leadership School.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Mott Hall V is a secondary school with 651 students from grades 6 through grade 12. The school population comprises 
20% Black, 73% Hispanic, 1% White, and 4% Asian students. The student body includes 11% English language learners 
and 22% special education students. Boys account for 50% of the students enrolled and girls account for 50%. The 
average attendance rate for the school year 2015-2016 was 91.0% 

 

Currently, about 26% of our students have IEP’s and we offer programs in the small class, ICT and SETSS settings.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Framework Element MOST GROWTH: The framework element where we have seen the most growth is in 
Collaborative Teachers. Using a distributive leadership model, teacher leaders and teacher teams work with 
administration to set school agendas that aim at student achievement.  

Framework Element – key area of Focus: This year’s framework element where we will be focusing our attention is 
Rigorous Instruction.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
In the 2017-2018 school year, 15% of grades 6-8 met standards in ELA and 17% in Math, all falling below the city 
average of 84%, 30% and 31% respectively.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, school leaders will create and implement professional development that will focus on instructional 
support (including interventions and scaffolds) to increase rigor for all students, resulting in a 5% increase in our NYS ELA 
& Math Exams scores for our middle school.

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the school’s Quality Review : All teachers are engaged in consistently examining teacher practice and 
student data within inquiry-based structured professional collaborations. Across the school teachers use common 
assessments to track student progress and make adjustments to curricula. Distributed teacher leadership is 
embedded across all areas of the school. School-wide instructional coherence is seen throughout all classrooms and 
teachers play an integral role in key decisions that affect teaching and learning across the school resulting in increased 
student achievement. All teachers meet twice a week during grade and department team meetings to analyze student 
data, review student work products, and share student academic as well as social emotional progress. In addition to 
these regularly scheduled meetings, the vast majority of teachers work in smaller informal learning group meetings 
during prep periods or communicate through emails to discuss best practices and individual supports for specific 
students who may need additional support.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, Content Area Teams will develop rigorous CCLS aligned units of study, performance tasks, rubrics, 
common grade level assessment and individual instructional goal sheets for students as measured by a 5% increase of 
student promotion to the next grade.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the school’s Quality Review : The school has a culture of mutual accountability and staff takes ownership 
on improving their own practice and creating true partnerships with parents that result in increased student 
achievement. Leadership and staff successfully partner with families to support student progress towards high 
expectations connected to college and career readiness. Parents spoke about how teachers not only communicate 
with them on a daily basis using the school’s website Pupil Path, but that they also regularly provide them with 
strategies to support their children when they are working at home. Several parents specifically spoke of how 
workshops such as “Math Night” and “Study Skills and Organization” have been extremely helpful in providing 
support at home. The school’s parent coordinator works collaboratively with the parent association to ensure that all 
parent workshops are dual language to serve the large number of bilingual speaking parents in the community. The 
principal provided evidence of additional parent workshops on topics such as transitioning to middle school and 
reading skills. Parents can implement reading strategies at home with their children. Furthermore, the school is 
scheduled to have additional workshops based on parent interest. 

Based on the data from our most recent survey, with 45% of parents participating, over 95% of parents were satisfied 
with the school’s instructional core, systems for improvement and school culture. One noted area of growth that 
stands out is 10% stated that they never had been invited to an event at the school.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, parental involvement in school events will increase from 10% to 20%, along with using parent coordinator 
on line tracking system created by NYCDOE

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Administrators attend job and teaching fairs for new teachers (Teaching Fellows) and experienced teachers (ATR’s) 
and we review resumes submitted on the DOE online Open Market system to find highly qualified teachers. We 
promote teachers from within to become content leaders, attend specialized professional development, and mentor 
our new and struggling teachers. Our professional development focuses, along with D12 partnership with the New 
teacher Center which focuses heavily on student engagement, rigor, and the increased use of technology to motivate 
our students. Our PD is a direct result of our observations in teacher classrooms and the data collected from high-
stakes assessments and student work. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
New and untenured teachers are supported by state-required Mentoring, professional development to meet required 
new teacher PD hours for state licensing, and our connections and programs affiliated with local college and 
universities (so they can earn required credits for certification). Veteran teachers are offered leadership opportunities 
and programs to support their continued growth within the school, and have a voice in school leadership through 
school-wide positions and as part of the SLT team.  

All staff will participate in ongoing Professional Development activities both within and outside of the school building. 
Some of these professional development activities will be facilitated by our Network coaches.

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
We are a 6 to 12 school  

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
During weekly departmental team meetings, teachers decide which assessments will be used, and after administering, 
meet to review results and make instructional decisions based on those outcomes. Teachers that are in departments 
in which MOSL baselines were administered will analyze that data to inform curricular development going forward, 
and provide aligned interim benchmarks to assess growth on targeted indicators. Departmental leads will share data 
analysis best practices with one another, and teachers will attend network and citywide professional development 
opportunities on data usage and analysis that are in line with the Danielson Framework for Teacher Effectiveness. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 

effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Mott Hall V, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Mott Hall V will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act. 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;

Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

Looking at data from both State assessments and from teacher created tasks, our ELL population 
falls below the general education population in multiple areas.  Throughout the 2015-16 school 
year, ELL’s were over represented on our Academic Probation lists, which flag students who are 
failing more than one course.  In terms of state data, particularly in the middle school, 100% of 
ELL’s in 8th grade, 70% in in 7th and 81% in 6th scored a level 1 on their ELA exams.  In math, 
85%, 90% and 81% scored a level one in 8th, 7th and 6th grade respectively.  Looking at our 
continuing HS level ELL’s, 47% are currently off-track in terms of credit accumulation and 28% 
are off track in terms of exam status.  Both figures are significantly higher than the general 
education population. It is clear to us that this population needs both more support outside of the 
class as well as more training for all teachers who work with them on a daily basis.  
 
All ELLs and former ELLs in grades 6-12 will be served in our programs, as the data shows that 
as a group, they are not meeting expectations to the same extent as the rest of the student 
body.  We currently service 82 ELL’s grades 6-12.  Based on NYSESLAT and NYSISTELL 
data, 44 are Expanding, 32 Transitioning, 2 Emerging and 3 Entering.  14 of our 82 students are 
considered “Long-Term” ELLs.    
 
AFTER SCHOOL: Student Support Center: Title III funding is used for programs outside of our 
school day such as the Student Support Center. ELL's students will have the opportunities to 
receive targeted language tutoring students receive tutoring services in their major subjects three 
days a week – Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, after school for an hour from 3pm to 4 pm 
by 3 certified ENL instructor for appropratlet 60 sessions . One  ENL instructor will focus 
exclusively on 10 ELLs each day on a rotating basis. These ELLs are either Entering, Emerging, 
or Transitioning. The Student Support Center will open in October and will run through 
June.  The language of instruction with be English with native language support.  The student 
support center is staffed by a teacher with an ESL license along with Spanish certification. Title 
III funds the ENL certified teacher. Students have access to both text and online resources during 
these sessions, mostly created by teachers in house to meet their respective courses' 
standards.  Glossaries are also available in for these sessions. Last year we started with Achieve 
3000 with an 8th grade pilot group as an academic intervention.  Students from this grade level 
therefore also have this resource available to them during their time in the Student Support 
Center. Language of instruction is English, however assistance is given to a few low-English-
proficient students in Spanish. Glossaries are available to students in their native languages for

most subject areas. Additionally, articles and notes in students’ native languages are made 
available on an as-need basis. They are given the opportunity to discuss content in their native 
language with other students. 
 
Saturday Academy: Title III funding is also used for Saturday Academy which offers state 
assessment preparation for ELA, Math and Content Regents exams.  This program will begin 
after the Mid-winter break in February for Middle School and starting in April for HS.  Saturday 
Academy begins and extends through the 8 weeks before the exam, depending on the grade 
level.  All sessions are three hours long, starting at 10 am and ending at 1 pm, here in the 
building.  Groups are structured so that ELLs in our targeted group receive instruction targeted 
towards their learning needs based on data gathered before and throughout the year in their 
classes (state exam results, performance tasks, unit exams, teacher generated data, NYSESLAT, 
etc.)  This year we are also offering Saturday intervention support starting as early as October for 
students in HS and in November for those in MS.  Both groups include students in our ELL 
target population.  The language of instruction is English with native language support. Three 
certified ENL teachers will participate in the program. Student glossaries, leveled texts, 
educational software, and parallel texts in students’ native languages and English are used both 
during the school day, and during Saturday Academy as well as test preparation materials for 
Saturday Academy, supported by title III funds. The ELLs specific instruction will focus on the 
four modalities of Language, aligned with the NYSESLAT – speaking, reading, listening, and 
writing. Students will work on assignments that require skills from each modality at their own 
pace – it will lead up to an argumentative writing assignment, which also supports the writing 
curriculum of both middle and high school.  One ENL teacher will push in to 3 content classes 
for 1 hour to provide contain specific language support

Begin description here:            
    At Mott Hall V we believe that the school is a place of learning not only for the students but 
for our entire team.  Seeing as our ELL population continues to grow each year, particularly in 
the 6th grade, we've planned for professional development on serving ELLs into both the school 
day and offered outside PD to both ESL and general education teachers, who then turn key 
material in their teams. 
 
 
 
In order to support content teachers with the instruction of ELLs, teachers attend professional 
development provided by an ENL teacher in order to become familiar with the SIOP lesson plan 
and hands-on activities. Additionally, a representative of the Bronx Borough Field Office will 
provide teachers with professional development on integrated instruction in content 
classes.  These PD’s take place formally for the entire school during designated ½ day PD’s or 
Chancellor’s Day as well as to smaller groups of teachers throughout the year in PLC’s in which 
our ENL teachers participate.  These PDs will take place November 4, December 2, January 30,

April 7, May 5, and June 8. They will center on Vocabulary Acquisition, specific strategies to 
target ELLs in a general education class, and differentiating different types of assessments for 
ELLs. 
 
 
 
All teachers in the building will receive PD specifically focused on servicing ELLs across 
content areas as well as learning about Universal Design for Learning in order to better plan with 
all learners in mind.  Our ENL coordinator attends PD provided by the Bronx Borough Field 
Office as well as other support centers and passes along opportunities for PD to other teachers.  
 
 
 
We are also establishing AIS planning sessions for teachers to better support their groups of 
students during the school day.  Through these PD's and team meetings, teachers come up with 
strategies that can support students both through the Student Support Center or Saturday 
Academy.  For instance, instructional materials for ELL's are workshopped through the 
collaboration of the ELA and ENL teachers.  Students tutored through the Student Support 
Center are given scaffolds designed through PD or teacher team meeting 
 
 
 
Finally, each week teachers meet in grade teams to discuss any difficulties students may be 
encountering across content areas including struggling ELL's.  In addition, the ENL department 
meets weekly to plan for school-wide PD, revise curriculum and develop systems to better 
monitor the progress of all ELL's throughout the year including revisions made to our after 
school programs. All agenda an attendance willl be kept on file

Mott Hall V ensures that parents of ELLs will be afforded the opportunity to participate in school 
meetings. Activities include: Holding monthly PTA meetings with translators present, SLT and 
all sub-committees of all of these bodies, Parent Teacher conferences, cultural nights, orientation 
meeting for incoming 6th grade families, workshops, hiring of a parent coordinator, developing a 
parent resource center.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Our procedures for informing the parents of ELLs in a timely fashion of meetings, workshops, 
and other opportunities available to parents are the following: in addition to the above-mentioned 
parent meetings, the administration regularly distributes to every child all bulletins from the 
district in English and Spanish when available to take home to parents. The PTA also prepares 
bulletins and the school arranges for the distribution of these flyers to every child. Translations 
of all documents are provided in the student's home language as needed. The parent coordinator 
will provide parents with a monthly parent packet that will include, but is not limited to, parent 
newsletter, PTA flyers, monthly calendar and workshop flyers. Full school mailings may be 
conducted at least four times a year. Communications with ELL parents including group callings 
and individual telephone calls are conducted in English and in the student's home language, as 
appropriate. Our school monitors the attendance of parents at all school functions and asks for 
feedback from the parents. 
 
 
 
Parents' workshops designed for parents of ELL's and supported through title III funds include an 
orientation at the beginning of the year, graduation requirements and understanding the college 
process, which are supported by at least one ENL teacher. The first ENL workshop for parents is 
on September 28, 2018, from 6:00 to 6:30. 
 
 
 
A new website was created by the ENL coordinator to provide parents with information in 
regards to upcoming events, the NYSESLAT, and also provides an additional way for parents to 
get in contact with the ENL coordinator. 
 
 
 
During any of the previous parent engagement activities, participants will sign-in. On the 
previously mentioned website, notifications of meetings and workshops will be made in several 
languages to ensure that parents are aware of all events. The ENL coordinator will maintain 
records of attendance during these meetings, as well as the agenda.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
NY State ELA results and Writing Rubrics are used to determine the reading levels and writing abilities of ELLs. The data has 
guided us in providing instruction targeted to the specific needs of our students.  The information helped to inform our school 
as to the reading and writing trends common among our ELLs. As a result, we formed AIS groups and writing tutorials to assist 
our students with reading comprehension, word study for phonics, vocabulary development, spelling through direct 
instruction, and process writing.  In examining the data, we noted interesting trends especially in reading.  In starting our AIS 
groups, we noted increased mastery of the CCLS. This was done by practicing these standards  with fictional and informational 
passages through comprehension questions and vocabulary instruction.  In the High School, students' historical testing data, 
reading baselines given in the 9  th   grade through in ELA classes, and writing baselines using NYC performance tasks are used 
to assess early literacy skills of ELLs.  Students are scheduled for writing courses to meet their needs as ELLs and are given 
access to targeting software, such as No Red Ink, to improve skills such as grammar and syntax.  A vocabulary curriculum

around academic vocabulary supplements advisory classes in 9  th   and 10  th   grade where students are grouped by learning 
needs and strengths.     
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

In order to assess the reading and writing levels of ELLs, the AIS groups are convenient way to meet with ELLs and monitor 
their progress. As portfolios are kept in these classes, both students and teachers can see the progress students are making 
and make changes to the curriculum or differentiate at their discretion. Students also work in a program called I-Ready that 
helps them to improve in English and it is structured in a way that moves on as they are ready. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
By looking at data from both end of year assessments in previous years and periodic assessments throughout the year, we 
reflect on the areas of strength and areas in need of improvement in the ENL program.  Qualitative data is also collected and 
feedback for improvement given, through cycles of observation in ENL classrooms.  Each year, improvements are suggested as 
data is reviewed.     
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

In addition to monitoring progress, The AIS groups are a great opportunity to find areas of struggle for students and provide 
direct instruction. These AIS groups are created and filled with students that have demonstrated a need for targeted 
instruction based upon previous assessments and class progress. If many students are struggling with a certain modality, it 
may be taught whole-class. If all students vary in what they have trouble with, then the teacher can plan for each student, as 
the AIS groups tend to be smaller than a gen-ed class.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Grade teams use scholarship data to identify students who are struggling in their current classes and develop action plans for 
groups of student including ELLs.  In departments, teachers analyze state assessment data to revise and improve curriculum as 
well as the data from periodic assessments. If students show that they are struggling with a specific modality, it is noted and 
when creating work, teachers will try to target those students to practice with that modality. The majority of the time, reading 
and writing tend to be the focus. Teachers, who are part of the respective grade team meetings, create RTI groupings of 
students to receive instruction in that subject area where they most need help with.  ELLS are grouped in this way too. In 
addition, students that require more one-on-one or group instruction are asked to come in for Saturday Academy, especially 
for test-prep. There will be an ENL certified teacher preparing them for the ELA exam on Saturdays in March of 2018. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data from the Spring NYSESLAT and our students who tested in the NYSITELL revealed that our entering and emerging 
students are in need of listening/speaking development as well as reading/writing, while many of our transitioning and 
expanding students are in need of specific reading and writing instruction. As a result, we are best able to prepare student 
through listening, speaking, reading and writing activities in the classroom. Many students are exposed to a 'stations' set up in 
class in which they complete assignments, one for each modality, related to the same topic.   
 
Also, based on their levels, the ENL teacher targets certain students and has them work on their areas of struggle. For 
example, in the high school ENL class, if a student's weakest area is reading, then they will focus more on the reading station 
with the teacher as well as independently. There are also check-ins. Once students finish a unit/topic, the teacher has the 
students fill out a tracker/progress tracker in which they make note of their progress in each modality and share goals. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

During group meetings such as grade team or department meetings, teachers wil discuss ELL students and their areas of 
stregnth/weakness. In this format, teachers can discuss what they believe works best for helping these students and others 
can share what has worked for them or what has not.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Mott Hall V is proud of its ability to maintain and develop excellent academic performance for its students.  In an 
effort to support our English Language Learners we adhere to the state mandates based on language proficiency as 
identified on the NYSESLAT.  Our rigorous freestanding ENL program is both a push-in and pull out instructional 
model.  A large percentage of our instructional plan calls for collaborative planning and curriculum-aligned support. 
We use ELLs strategies  both in the pull out and push in models.  In push-in classes, an ENL teacher co-plans with the 
content teacher and SPED teacher to both share concerns for specific students as well as develop strategies, 
materials, and mini-lessons that will target not only ELLs but also low-performing students. 
As for standalone, students who are ELLs but do not have an IEP are grouped together in one homeroom on each 
grade level in the middle school to allow for an integrated push in model for ELA classes.  Small groups are also 
constructed to provide AIS twice a week with the ENL provider for students.  Mandated after school sessions are also 
part of our flexible planning model for stand alone ENL. In high school, there are two targeted groups and both are 
mixed proficiency. One is a 10th grade group and much of the work provided is differentiated articles in which 
students read and answer questions, both multiple choice and short answer to demonstrate understanding. Also, 
there is a strong focus on grammar.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Students are scheduled for stand alone ENL instruction through ENL writing classes, AIS groups and mandated scheduled pull 
out support dependent on their mandates (180 or 90 minutes).  Stand alone ENL classes are offered through AIS scheduled 
classes and pull out support.  Integrated ENL instruction occurs in writing classes (180-90 minutes) where students work on 
ELA and SS content integrated with instruction to meet their needs as ELLs and count towards credit in their core subjects. 
Integrated instruction also occurs when our ENL teacher pushes in to ELA or subject area classes.  For high school students 
who need the additional 180 minutes a week, services are provided by 3, 60 minute additional periods of instruction added on 
to the school day with an ENL teacher.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The  pull out and push in component of our ENL plan requires co-teaching and individual direct instruction. This individualized 
and small group instruction includes a variety of hands on strategies to include flexible grouping, cooperative learning and 
scaffolding techniques in reading and writing.  The pull out program more finely targets the strengths and needs of our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

entering, emerging, transitioning and expanding and commanding students . It addresses the four modalities based on basic 
interpersonal conversational skills as well as a strong emphasis on cognitive academic language proficiency. The balanced 
literacy approach to reading and writing allows for a strong emphasis on vocabulary development through the use of 
accountable talk, active listening in addition to shared reading and writing structures during our pull out time. These 
approaches include process writing, balanced literacy, vocabulary development, cooperative learning, grammar language 
structures, contextualization and use of technology. More specifically stated it includes wide scale use of vocabulary 
development builders, close exercises, multiple choice comprehension checks, reading reinforcement activities, discussion 
starters, role play, listening skills exercises, key grammatical structures, quizzes and tests appropriate to students’ grades and 
level of proficiency. These strategies cross all curriculum areas and provide ongoing assessments based on the English as a 
Second Language standards in literacy and social studies. Differentiated instruction is pursued through a well balanced literacy 
model.  The Bloom's Taxonomy elements are used on a daily basis during instruction.  Students are placed in various groupings 
that include small group, individual, partner and whole group instuction.  There is also constant efforts to attend to the 
individual needs of each student that is supported by a variety of instructional strategies.  Students are encouraged to identify 
individual and group learning goals.  Accomplishments are readily supported through verbal and written feedback.  In addition, 
all ELLs are provided instruction in all four modalities -- listening, speaking, reading and writing -- with the goal of increasing 
their ability to pass the NYSESLAT.  Long term ELLs are supported in the same way, but the grammatical language 
structures  and vocabulary are more advanced. With such diverse learning approaches ELLs are able to discover language 
through experiments and process writing approaches.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

If a student enters and is identified as a beginning ELL they are given the opportunity to practice state exams in their native 
language, as long as they are available.  Results of the Spanish LAB are also used for students whose home language is 
Spanish.  If they perform better in these practice exams they are able to take the exam or have a copy of the exam in their 
native lanugage during the test administration.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

We pay special attention to our SIFE population through differentiated instruction. SIFE students are included in Balanced 
Literacy Reading  Writing Tutorials, and AIS groups where we scaffold comprehension by paying special attention to vocabulary 
development. We also push in to provide extra support  in the content areas. Students who are new to the country have 
benefited from an increase in access to visuals and graphic organizers.  Additional support through the use of the Rosetta 
Stone software is also available to these students. Special attention is provided to long term ELLs by an intensive reading and 
writing instruction. Aditionally we provide extra support in preparation for the NYSESLAT, in order to support their exit from 
the program. In order to provide the best possible support to the ELLs that receive Special Education Services, we at Mott Hall 
V, increase the application of visual support to help them have a better underestanding of the writing process. Also to increase 
their comprehensible input and meaning experiences we use  scaffolded reading strategies, and an increased application of 
kinesthetic strategies that support vocabulary development, syllabication, phonics and spelling. IEPs of individual ELLs are 
reviewed to make sure that all recommended instructional strategies are properly implemented during instruction.  ELLs who 
fall in the 4-6 year category are also given additional support with moving them from Entering to Emerging to Transition to 
Expanding and finally to Commanding. Students who have passed the NYSESLAT are still supported through instructional 
strategies in the classroom like graphic organizers and visuals as well as  testing accomodations as needed.  In addition these 
students are also provided with 90 minutes of Integrated ENL services either through a co-teaching or push in model with an 
ENL teacher or through AIS services depending on their needs.  Like all current ELLs, up to two years after earning proficiency 
on the exam or having earned a "commanding" level, former ELLs will still receive testing accommodations that they are 
entitled to.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ENL teachers read students IEPs in order to determe what strategies will most successfully be implemented to meet both their 
learning needs and their language development.  The use of strategies such as graphic organizers, visuals, setence starters or 
framers, writing templates, hands on activities, scaffolded questions, etc, support learnesr with mutliple needs.  Targeted 
software such as iReady and No Red Ink also support students in picking up on their individual needs and levels.  When a 
student has multiple mandates from both ELL entitlements and IEP mandates, the school uses flexible scheduling (through 
data driven writing and AIS groups) the push in and co-teaching model as well as after-school and lunch support in order to 
best service the child.         
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The school uses both a push in and pull out model to allow more flexibility for students whose IEP mandantes and ENL 
mandates overlap.  AIS and writing groups in the middle school and electives in the high school, allow students to be grouped 
according to their needs.      
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
AIS groupings are made throughout the school based on students' previous state test scores as well as periodic assessments 
given in house.  EN and EM ELLs are first targeted for language acquisition, with tier 1 vocabulary and more supports 
(glossaries, translating services from home language, etc), while transitioning and expanding students are exposed to more 
academic vocabulary instruction and exposure to non-fiction texts related to units of study in Social Studies and Science.  ELA 
and Math after school and Saturday Academies are planned and delived for all students, including ELLs with groupings 
determined by periodic assessments given in those two content areas.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are currently looking into adding resources which allow students to gain more access to listening and speaking exercises at 
their own pace by creating multiple "centers" in the middle school classrooms which best meet students' needs. The resource 
"iReady" will be continue to be used for the ELL program in the middle school. This resource will enhance and develop 
students' English Language Development based on their entering, emerging, or transitioning level. In preparation for the 
NYSESLAT, the book series by Continental "Finish Line - New York ELLs" will be used in both the middle school and high school 
to help acclimate students to the newer format of the test, as well as practice in each modality. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All school services correspond to ELL's age and grade levels.  In addition, ELLs are provided with social, emotional supports by 
school counselors and other support staff. The effort to increase the students’ social and emotional development is provided 
through informal meetings between student and ENL instructor conducted throughout the school day. Specific plans for 
extension of service for students  have also been developed to address specific needs identified among ELL students. During 
the 2016-2017 school year all ELLs have been offered the possibility of meeting with their ENL teacher for help in develping 
their English Language two times a week after school.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
In order to support ELLs, differentiated instrunctional materials are used in the classroom like computers, smartboard, dry 
erase boards, recorders, manipulatives, graphic organizers, visuals, etc.  Targeted software such as iReady and No Red Ink are 
used to assess and meet students where they are.  Teaching resources available in mutliple languages such as Brainpop, are 
used in some content classes to support newcomers. In the high school stand alone classes, students are given the opportunity 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

to work on assignments either on Google Classroom or on paper, whichever they find more comfortable. Additionally, because 
they are working on stations, they are able to work at their own pace and get individualized support.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Students are offered glossaries and dictionaries in their native language to use in the both ENL classes and in content 
courses.  Teachers also provide texts and readings in native languages for beginner ELLs who have literacy proficiency in their 
native language.  When students have had experience using these resources they have access to them for their end of term 
assessments. For state exams, students are permitted to receive the exam in their home langauge as long as it's available.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Depending on the student's proficiency and age, materials are adapted so as not to look childish or elementary, even as a 
student's ability to comprehend the language may be low.  Websites such Newsela, Text Compactor or Google Translate are 
also offered to students, particuarly in the upper grades to support their comprehension of more complex, denser texts.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
At times, the ENL coordinator in another school in the building has made clear that they needed guidance on administering the 
NYSESLAT. Our ENL coordinator has taken time to discuss procedures and answer any question the coordinator may have had. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Student orientation workshops are provided to assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year and are 
planned and facilitated by the school's assistant principals.  New ELLs who arrive mid-year receive a home language 
identification survey from Ms. Forgacs, the ENL coordniator, and an orientation through Ms. Rosa, our parent coordinator, and 
are given a tour of the school and are paired with a student to support them in their first weeks.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

French and Spanish are offered as World Language electives. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
At Mott Hall V we believe that the school is a place of learning not only for the students but for our entire team.  Seeing as our 
ELL population continues to grow each year, particularly in the 6th grade, we've planned for professional development on 
serving ELL's into both the school day and offered outside PD to both ENL and general education teachers, who then turn key 
material in their teams. During the 2016-2017 school year, the ENL coordinator attended several ELLs liaison's meetings in 
which both strategies and tools for compliance were discussed. The PDs that were turnkeyed to the general education 
teachers, SPED teachers, as well as non-instructional staff including paraprofessionals. This year involved vocabulary

acquisition strategies, using the New Language Arts Progressions to better serve ELLs, and SIOP strategies.  he ENL teachers are 
able to attend PDs on ELLs strategies, teaching complex texts to ELLs, and push-in models for ENL providers. There are lists of 
teachers' names instructed to attend specific PDs and lists are kept. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
During several half day PDs, the ENL team is asked to provide training to the general education teachers and these continue to 
be a series of PDs relating to vocabulary, differentiation strategies, and other topics teachers may have questions about. 
Recent PD topics have included SIOP lessons, NLAP review, writing language objectives, focusing on vocabulary, and similar 
topics. 
The ENL certified staff also attend various PDs around NYC for ELLs that include close-reading stratgies, language objectives, 
and many more. These PDs are listed on a calendar for each teacher that attends as well as certificates. Attendance is always 
taken when attending these out-of-school PDs 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Each year when entitlement or non-entitlement letters are sent out, parents are invited to meet with the ELL coordinator, 
either ENL teacher or the assistant principal to further discuss their student's program.  Using the parent engagement time of 
40 minute per week, as well as additional prof time, teachers reach out to parents to hold conferences about progress.  The 
Parent Resource Center is also open 4 days a week for parents to come into the school and check their students' progress using 
the online grading system.  These are also opportunities to schedule conferences when necessary.  When necessary, the 
parent coordinator or our family worker are used to support in translation services.  Outreach to parents is documented in our 
online grading system and labeled as "outreach." Parents are also offered the option of using a translator.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Mott Hall V ensures that all parents, including parents of ELLs will be afforded the opportunity to participate in school 
meetings. Activities include: Holding monthly PTA meetings, SLT and all sub-commitees of all of these bodies, Parent Teacher 
conferences, cultural nights, orientation meeting for incoming 6th grade families, workshops, hiring of a parent coordinator , 
developing a parent resouce center. The Parent Coordinator and PA President survey parents about their needs and create 
workshops accordingly.  Our procedures for informing the parents in a timely fashion of meetings, workshops, and 
other  opportunities available to parents are the following: in addition to the above-mentioned parent meetings, the 
administration regularly distributes to every child all bulletins from the district in English and Spanish when available to take 
home to parents. The PTA also prepares bulletins and the school arranges for the distribution of these flyers to every child. 
Translations of all documents are provided in the student's home language. The parent coordinator will provide parents with a 
monthly parent packet that will include, but is not limited to, parent newsletter, PTA flyers, monthly calendar and workshop 
flyers. Full school mailings may be conducted at least four times a year. Communications with ELL parents including group 
callings and individual telephone calls are conducted in English and in the student's home language, as appropriate. Our school 
monitors the attendance of parents at all school functions and asks for feedback from the parents.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Peter Oroszlany, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In examining the data reported on the RDGS ats report, Home Language Surveys, and Student Emergency Contact 
cards, we have noticed that a high percentage of our students come from Spanish speaking families. Furthermore, 
during our parent orientation sessions, we have observed a substantial number of parents that do not 
comprehend the English lanaguage sufficiently to participate without translation services. 

As stated above, in analyzing the data and meeting the parents of our students, all information, either in written 
form or oral presentation, in our school is provided in the parents home languauge using either materials 
provided by the DOE or translation services.
