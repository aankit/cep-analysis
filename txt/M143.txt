Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

The element of the Framework for Great Schools in which our school made the most progress over the past year was 
our Effective School Leadership. Our school leadership cabinet’s commitment to supporting and nurturing staff and 
teachers’ professional growth, leading to improved student achievement has been evidenced by frequent and 
actionable feedback to teachers, through Advance. Professional Development opportunities have not only been 
provided through a wide range of forums and related to diverse content, but teachers have provided input and voice 
into their own professional needs through recommendations to the school’s Staff Development Committee; Teacher 
Teams; teacher reflection forms and questionnaires; and through ongoing, informal professional conversations. 

Considering the compelling research about the significance of effective feedback correlating to improved student 
outcomes and in consideration of supervisory observations and teachers’ ratings this year, which highlighted 
teachers’ strengths and areas of need, it is determined that our school’s instructional focus for 2018-2019 will 
continue to be Assessment in Instruction and Feedback to Students (Danielson Framework for Teaching, component 
3d), leading to improved student performance and progress. This determination was based on June 2018 Advance 
data. We have invested heavily this year on providing extensive and differentiated professional development for 
teachers and paraprofessionals in this critical aspect of instruction and understand how continuing this work will 
strengthen pedagogical practices to yield improved student outcomes. 

It is also important to note two trends that impact our ongoing work and these are, as follows: Our overall student 
population has been decreasing over the past 5 years, with students and families selecting alternate educational 
options, such as Charter Schools or other middle schools. This trend represents a strong indication that we must 
create, nurture, and promote our school as one that will be desirable for teenagers and their families and one that 
will be successful, as measured by our students’ perceptions and successes.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Although the most recent School Quality Review in November 2016, did not cite Quality Indicator 4.1 in the findings, our 
Leadership Cabinet, comprised of the Principal and two Assistant Principals, review Advance feedback and evaluation 
ratings for teachers each month to determine patterns, trends, and professional needs, in order to strategically provide 
appropriate and differentiated professional development support for the teachers. We have noted that our teachers are 
scoring lower in Domain 3 Instruction (components 3b, 3c, 3d) as compared to their ratings for Domain 2-Classroom 
Environment (components 2a and 2d). We also see inconsistencies in teaching practices, across the school, that prevent 
all students from engaging in meaningful and rigorous tasks, activities, and learning. 

The priority needs for this Capacity Framework Element are to nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff; to 
develop and deliver instructional and social-emotional support that drives students’ achievement.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

We self-rated by reviewing our 2017-2018 NYC School Survey, which revealed the following parent responses, in 
relation to questions about Strong Family-Community Ties: 

(Page 22) : 

School Staff regularly communicates with parents/guardians about how parents can help students. 86% agreed and 
strongly agreed  

 

Teachers communicate regularly with parent/guardians. 90% agreed and strongly agreed  

Teachers work closely with families to meet students' needs. 93% agreed and strongly agreed  

Parents/guardians are greeted warmly when they call or visit the school 95% agreed and strongly agreed

The survey results reflect a varying degree of parental satisfaction, with an increase in overall parent satisfaction from 
the previous school year. As a school, we believe that we can still improve upon our parental outreach and efforts. Since 
strong family school partnerships and ties are such critical attributes of successful schools, we will implement our action 
plans for this goal, as well as embed parental engagement activities within the other goals and action plans that are 
identified in this CEP.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.  
By June 2019, in response to questions related to communication and data, at least 80% of parent respondents will 
agree or strongly agree as measured by the results of the 2019 NYC School Survey.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Our hiring committee consists of administrators and teachers. In early spring, teachers are asked to predict if they will 
return the following year. Based on the response, a search begins using the partnerships with universities and NYC 
Teaching Fellow. When Open Market becomes available, vacancies are posted. Candidates are invited to visit the 
school informally to determine if they would fit in with the school culture. Candidates are interviewed. If it is 
determined that the candidate is a person of interest, the candidate does a demonstration lesson which is observed 
by administrators and coaches. Where appropriate, students are asked for feedback about the candidate’s teaching. 
After all candidates are interviewed the committee meets to make selections.  

When necessary, administrative staff will attend hiring fairs to identify and recruit highly qualified teachers. We will 
also conduct outreach to local universities for potential candidates. The payroll secretary will work closely with the 
FSC HR point person to ensure that all candidates meet all required deadlines and have all the all the required 
documentation. To ensure the retention of high quality teachers, teachers expertise and interests will be considered. 
Returning teachers will complete a preference sheet in the spring, their teaching preference for the fall. Once 
teachers are placed based on their expressed interest, new candidates will be placed based on the current vacancy. 
All Teachers will be provided with high quality professional development to support their growth creating a 
supportive learning environment based on their need as per teacher observations and expressed interest. 
Professional Development will include, but will  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and 
paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Professional Development is held weekly to bring instruction in line with the relevant Common Core Performance 
Standards, tasks and practice. The Professional Development Committee along with the administration, in 
collaboration with the Math and Literacy coaches developed the professional development plan based on teacher 
input and a needs assessment.  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           41 

 

We provide ongoing professional development on ENL strategies to support ENL learning for literacy and math 
bilingual and ENL teachers. Teachers attend OELL seminars on ENL instructional strategies as well as work with 
network support staff on the implementation of SIOP strategies.  

Teachers attend workshops focused on the Common Core Aligned Units of Study provided by instructional coaches 
and the consultant who provides feedback and workshops on content and pedagogy. Teachers participate in study 
groups using professional books addressing the needs of the ENLs, students with disabilities, and best pedagogical 
practices. Planning meetings are held once a week to enable our teachers to identify and target the language needs of 
students based on assessment of student work. In class coaching and after school PD sessions will be utilized. The 
book “Making Thinking Visible” will be used to provide PD and in class coaching to accelerate the academic 
performance of ENLs in all content areas. 

Professional development will support teachers in providing high quality instruction in students’ identified areas of 
need. Teachers will receive PD on the following topics: Developing higher order questions, strengthening learning and 
language objectives, strengthening vocabulary in the content areas, developing reading fluency, conferring, and 
improving student writing in different genres. Paraprofessionals will participate and district PD providing them with 
the skills necessary to support teachers and students in the learning process. Paraprofessional will also participate in 
self-selected professional book clubs on topics aligned to the school's instructional priorities which will support them 
as they support students in meeting the Common Core Learning Standards. The principal and assistant principals will 
participate in high quality district and FSC led professional development as well as school based book clubs aligned to 
the school's instructional priorities.

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
The MOSL committee met, and will continue to meet, to determine the local measure for teachers. UFT titles will 
meet with their constituents to get feedback back on the types of assessments that teachers are linked to. The 
Professional Development committee met, and will continue to meet, to provide input on professional development 
topics. Teacher teams meet to select and create formative/summative assessments used throughout the school year. 
Teachers will evaluate prior assessments and make revisions as necessary allowing access for all leanings including 
SWDs and ELLs. The results of the assessments will be analyzed in Teacher Teams noting trends and next steps for 
teaching and learning. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           43 

 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Eleanor Roosevelt School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A 
of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Eleanor Roosevelt Intermediate School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

●providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

●providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

●fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

●providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

●sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

●providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

●actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

●engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly 
to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

●support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

●maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

●conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           47 

 

●provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

●host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

●schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

●translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

●conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Meeting; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

In addition to the existing core ELL instructional program; I.S. 143M will provide an after 
school program for ELLs under Title III.  The after school program will complement our core 
instructional program and be supplemental to mandated minutes as per CR PART 154. The 
program will support English Language development and high academic achievement in the core 
academic areas. Students will be given the opportunity to participate in activities that incorporate 
the four language modalities: reading, writing, speaking, and listening in English, as well as a 
focus on the content area of Math. 
Based on an analysis of  the 2018 NYSESLAT data, years of service and SIFE Status,  of our 
138 ELLs; we identified the long term ELLs and the SIFE students as the target population for 
the Title III program.  These particular populations are at a higher risk level and are in need of 
additional support. Each of the six after school groups will consist of 15 students of all 
proficiency levels in grades 6,  7 and 8, for a total of 90 students. Classes will take place 
Wednesdays and Thursdays after school from 2:30-4:00, from October 24,  2018- March 6, 2019 
for 16 weeks, 2 sessions per week, for a total of 32 sessions.  Our current ELLs will participate in 
a small group program to enhance academic English Through ENL.  Using state exam results 
and classroom assessments, the program  will enhance the academic English with a strong focus 
on  vocabulary, grammar, reading, and writing skills through literacy and math instruction in 
English. 
The focus of the 1.5 hour sessions will alternate between English language development through 
the content area of ELA and Math with ESL methodologies.  Three of the six groups will be in 
the ELA group on Wednesdays and the other three groups will participate in the three math 
groups. On Thursdays the ELA and Math groups from Wednesdays will rotate from ELA to 
math and from math to ELA. Students will participate in small group opportunities to engage in 
activities through the use of the computer based non-fiction program NEWSELA and the I-
Ready computer based program for math. All materials are already in the school.   
The number of teachers participating in the after school program will be six, 3 ESL NYS 
certified teachers (for the ELA groups,) and 3 NYS Math certified teachers with bilingual 
extensions (for the math groups).  The 3 ESL teachers will rotate their groups for Wednesdays 
and Thursdays with the 3 math teachers.  The Title III program supervisor, Ms. Sophia Matos is 
an Assistant Principal that holds NYS certification for ESL and literacy.  There is no other 
supplemental program running concurrently, Ms. Matos will solely supervise the Title III after 
school program.  Title III will not be used to fully fund the supervisor after school, only partially

All 6 teachers participating in the after school program will receive training in the use of 
academic content-based materials to support the implementation of the after school program. The 
teachers will participate in one after school session, before the program begins (October), 
provided by the program supervisor (S. Matos), as well as sessions throughout the year, once a 
month to improve their instruction and assessment of ELL students, collaborate with in an ELL 
professional learning community and discuss how well they are implementing these strategies 
and to have a positive and lasting impact on their teacher effectiveness and student 
outcomes.  The professional development will take place on the first Monday of each month 
(October to March) from 3:45 to 4:45 and will be facilitated by Ms. Matos. Specifically the 
teachers will be provided with professional development to improve teacher effectiveness in ELL 
instruction, to enhance the teachers' understanding and use of curricula, assessment measures, 
and instructional strategies to support their English Language Learners. The tentative dates for 
the professional development sessions are October 15, 2018, November 5, 2018, December 3, 
2018  January  7, 2019, February 4, 2019, and March 4, 2019. The titles for the professional 
development sessions are Teaching Vocabulary to ELLs- part 1, Teaching Vocabulary to ELLs -
part 2, Instruction and best practices for SIFE and Long term ELLs, Multiple Entry Points, The 
Data Driven Classroom, and an I-Ready professional development session will also be scheduled 
to support teachers with use of the I-Ready program by an I-Ready representative (the tentative 
Monday date is unavailable at this time). All records for the Title III Program, including agendas 
and attendance sheets for the Professional Development sessions will be kept in Title III  binder

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Begin description here:            
 
Parents will be invited, by telephone and in writing, to observe classes during the after-noon 
sessions in order to develop the English language, at least two times beginning in November and 
ending in March.  There will also be a  parent work-shop provided by Title III teachers and 
supervisor to explain the after-noon sessions as well a variety of ways to get parents involved in 
children’s education, such as supports at home for early literacy (SIFE Students) and long term 
ELLs. The workshop is scheduled for February during one of the after school program sessions 
from 3:00-4:00pm. The projected number of parents is 30-40. The use of translation and 
interpretation services will be used  for meeting with parents of ELLs. Other programs will be 
offered for parents in order to support English Language Acquisition; however these other 
programs will be supported with other funds, not Title III.  Additional parent workshops are 
scheduled every first Wednesday of the month from 9:00 to 10:30. The first parent workshop is 
scheduled for October 3, 2018. The majority of the topics will include: how to support your child 
at home (through varying content areas as well as preparing for state assessments). The 
workshops are presented each month by a different member of the faculty such as the principal 
(Ms. McDaniel-Luke), Assistant Principals (Ms. Gil and Ms. Matos), school guidance 
counselor (Ms. Aquino ), bilingual coordinator/literacy coach (Ms. Bayer), math coach (Ms. 
Brito), and parent coordinator (Ms. Anglero). The tentative dates for the workshops are

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Some of the assessment tools I.S. 143 uses to assess early literacy skills are I-Ready differentiated computer program in 
Literacy and MATH,  MYON Lexile baseline test (Lexile updates based on student use), NYC baseline assessments for ELA, Go 
Math Benchmark assessments, SIFE writing screener, Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener (vocabulary, reading comprehension 
and Early Literacy modules)  and teacher made assessments in both Spanish and English. Furthermore, ENL teachers also use 
the BrainPop ESL placement test, which provides a proficiency level that can be correlated to the levels used by NYCDOE 
schools. All of these assessments allow administration, teachers, students and parents to see what students’ literacy levels are 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           59 

 

for fiction and non-fiction texts, and the baseline for science, social studies and math. Knowing and understanding students’ 
literacy levels informs the school of what programs are appropriate for students, what materials and level of materials are 
needed for the students, such as the level of independent reading books or the types of content area text books would be 
appropriate for students. For example the differentiated computer  program I-Ready is best used for students with literacy 
Lexile levels of second to eighth grade, if a student is below the second to eighth grade range than this program would not be 
appropriate for that student.     
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teachers are provided with common planning time for instructional planning as well as provided with professional 
development to support and guide instructional planning for ELLs. The literacy coach administers the MLS and generates 
reports for teachers to use to determine appropriate interventions.The MLS provides teachers with data about students’ 
vocabulary and reading comprehension levels in their home language. If students score far below grade level, the early literacy 
assessment can also be administered. Taken as a whole, these tests provide teachers with data ranging from the pillars of 
literacy, including phonological awareness and sound letter correspondence, to students’ ability to identify information that is 
explicitly and implicitly stated in the text. With this information, teachers are then able to group students according to their 
areas of strength or need, differentiating their instruction to ensure that all students are challenged without being stifled or 
overwhelmed. During independent reading/writing time, teachers work with individuals or small groups to address the needs 
that the MLS has identified. Additionally, when conferring with individual students about reading or writing, teachers use the 
data to craft appropriate questions and goals for the students to work towards. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success for our programs is determined by the growth our ELLs demonstrate on their NYSESLAT exam in all four 
modalities. We also look at the ELLs progress and growth through the various assessments we use throughout the school year 
such I- Ready, MYOn, and benchmarks in math. We have noticed that our student population is changing in regards to English 
proficiency and we have less Emerging/Transitioning 
ELLs  and more  new comer ELLs (0-3 years) than previous years.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Our literacy coach and math coach meet with the teachers on a weekly basis to discuss and plan for instruction as well as look 
at student work and assessment data to improve instruction/ increase student learning. Teams use tools such as the New 
Language Arts Progressions to ensure that students are assigned tasks that are appropriate for their levels of language 
development, both in the receptive and productive domains. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Even though we are not a k-5 school, we do have interventions in place for our ELLs. Based on the data we realized that our 
ELLs need additional language support in the content areas.  We have content area teachers participating in Sheltered 
Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) so that the teachers can support the ELLs in language development in addition to the 
specific content area. We also have an ENL teacher teaching with in the social studies classes  in the Integrated ENL classes. 
This 2017-2018 school year we have also started an intervention period for Entering SIFE Students, to target what the students 
need in literacy.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We noticed that according to the data from the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) of the NYSESLAT the majority of our students 
(56%) remained at the same proficiency level, while 42% students Advanced 1 proficiency level.  Overall the pattern shows 
that the majority of our ELLs are scoring low in the writing modality.   According to the data from the NYSITELL of our newly 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           60 

 

 

arrived ELLs, they are either unable to complete the exam and/or their score is at the Entering level.   When reviewing and 
using the filtering functions of the EDAT, we have also determined that our ELLs have at least 3 at-risk factors. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

During the summer, prior to the start of the new school year, the instructional team reviews the data to make any necessary 
adjustments. At the start of the school year, the instructional team shares the data and findings with the teachers so that the 
teachers can plan and adjust their plans for the students.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

In our Free-Standing ENL program instruction is delivered for ELLs in an Integrated and standalone model. The classes 
are heterogeneously grouped by proficiency level  and  homogeneously  by grade when integrated, for example in our 
602 class the ENL teacher co-teaches with the social studies teacher to provide services for sixth grade students. In 
the Standalone free-standing ENL program the students are grouped  homogeneously  by proficiency 
level  and  heterogeneously by grade, for example in our 702 class and 802 class there are students that are at the 
emerging level that require additional ENL services than those provided in an integrated model. The ENL teacher 
provides additional services for the emerging students of grades 7 and 8 together.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Our Standalone ENL classes are  homogeneously grouped by proficiency by grade.  For example class 722 has 28 ELLs; 
those ELLs are of an Emerging and transitional proficiency level according to the 2017 NYSESLAT scores. These 
students are serviced through the transitional bilingual program. ESL and bilingual content area teachers teach all 
transitional bilingual (TBE). Currently there are three general education TBE classes and 2 bilingual special education 
classes, one on the sixth grade level (622), one on the seventh grade level (722), one on the eighth grade level (822), 
and 2 Bilingual Special Education combining multiple grades (252 & 253).  Class 252 and Class 253 are the Special Class 
12:1+1 bilingual class with students who are assessed by the New York State Alternate Assessment and the  Special 
Class 12:1 bilingual class with students who are assessed by the standardized assessments similar to their peers in the 
general education program. Students are organized in these classes by proficiency level to ensure that the mandated 
numbers of instructional minutes are delivered in all content areas.  Students in TBE classes receive a minimum of 5 
periods of HLA per week or 225 minutes per week. Students at the Entering/Emerging levels in both the TBE and 
Standalone ENL classes receive 360 minutes of ENL; the students who scored an Expanding on the NYSESLAT receive 4 
periods of ENL per week or 180 minutes per week. They also receive 4 periods of ELA per week.  
 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here:   N/A 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61 

 

      Instruction in the content area TBE classes is provided in the student’s home language (Spanish) with intensive support in 
English. The TBE classes started the school year on a 60/40 model and are currently moving toward a 50/50 model.  Students 
at the Entering/Emerging levels that are in our TBE classes receive 360 minutes of ENL, 225 minutes of HLA.  Students that are 
Transitioning and Expanding ELLs receive a minimum of 180 minutes of ENL in both the TBE and Free-standing ENL classes. Our 
commanding students receive a minimum of 90 minutes of ENL per week.  In our Free-standing ENL classes the content areas 
are taught in English. Students at  the Entering/ Emerging levels in free-standing ENL classes receive a minimum of 360 
minutes of ENL.  Teachers use ESL strategies, such as TPR, explicit, direct instruction in fluency, vocabulary, comprehension, 
scaffolds and structured opportunities for listening, speaking and writing while building the content knowledge  and 
developing their English skills.  Home language support such as using bilingual dictionaries, technology support and the buddy 
system, when available, are also used in both the TBE and ENL program. This year we have also begun to have ESL and content 
area teachers attend SIOP training to use such strategies in their teaching practices of ELLs.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Instruction in the content area TBE classes is provided in the student’s native language (Spanish) with intensive support in 
English.  Students at the Entering/Emerging levels that are in our TBE classes receive 225 minutes of HLA, 360-405 minutes of 
Math in Spanish,  180 minutes of social studies, and 180 minutes of science instruction in both Spanish and English per 
week.  The content areas (science, math, and social studies) that are taught in Spanish are done so to help students transfer 
their native language skills to English.  Students learning the content areas in their native language are also tested in their 
native language. This year we have also modified the scheduling so that a certified ENL teacher co-teaches the social studies 
classes so that the students can have additional language support within the content areas. The ESL teachers provides support 
in the content area by planning and co-teaching with the content area teacher.  Home language support is also provided for 
the content area in the Integraded ENL program through the use of texts in the home language and use of bilingual 
glossaries.  The instructional methods used across subject areas include: use of leveled texts, use of lower level texts that share 
the theme of the grade level unit text, use of audio texts and visuals as comprehensible input, modeling of academic behaviors 
and habits of mind, adjusting speech rate and simplifying speech (e.g. avoiding excessive use of idiomatic expressions) when 
addressing ELLs,  pre-teaching key terms of texts,  modeling use of graphic organizers, providing sentence frames to help 
students use appropriate academic language, facilitating ample time for student-directed discussion, clearly posting and 
referring to content and language objectives and teaching strategies that help students use context and word parts to make 
meaning of a text.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  Our testing coordinator orders the necessary assessment materials to accommodate each of our ELLs native language needs. 
In addition, other formative assessments used are developed by each individual instructor or by the department.  The 
assessments range from multiple choice, short response and essay.        
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

SIFE students are provided with differentiated instruction by participating in small group instruction within their class.  We 
have a vast number of intervention services being provided to our Newcomers and ELLs who have been in the program from 4 
- 6 years.  These groups of ELLs participate in our after school and Saturday programs.  ELLs are also invited to participate in 
the after school and Saturday programs.   For students demonstrating some form of interrupted schooling or those that will be 
taking the ELA for the first time this school year have been assigned academic intervention services providing them with help 
as well as, enrichment opportunities. Students who display being SIFE are monitored closely for progress and participate in the 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62 

 

extended day tutoring sessions with specific instruction geared toward developing their skills.   
Long term ELLs are closely being monitored and assessed intermittently to determine what areas they are progressing in, as 
well as, which ones they are not.  I-Ready, and MYON are also components being implemented as additional supports.  Long 
Term ELLs will also be participating in after school, Saturday,  and Alianza programs are housed in our school building  and 
counseling services which may aid in their development.        
All of ELLs are exposed to instructional strategies such as the use of technology through, SMART Boards, computer lab and lap 
top access;  small group instruction, modify and adapt grade level text,  graphic organizers, vocabulary development, "Just 
Right" books on child’s level, audio visual aids, review student data during teacher team meetings, and rotate groups between 
working in centers and working with teacher.     
Both Current ELLs and Former ELLs (up to 2 years) are given the appropriate test accommodations such as bilingual glossaries , 
exams  in the home language (in available languages) and extended time.   Furthermore, teachers refer to the New Language 
Arts Progressions to help differentiate instruction and tasks based on a student's level of literacy development.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
We are working closely with the Special Education department and the assistant principal that supervises special education  to 
ensure that all the materials used in general education classes are accessible to all ELLs with special needs and that all students 
receive services mandated on their IEPs as well as the mandated bilingual instruction. We review all materials to ensure that 
they are grade and age appropriate.  Materials include our individualized differentiated computer programs such as I-
Ready.  We look closely at their IEPs to determine what they are most in need of to provide them with an adequate form of 
instruction.  ELLs with special needs are also participants of the project based model and have access to the same 
opportunities as all ELLs, as well as, MYON and for additional support.  In addition Ms. Ramirez, the IEP teacher at I.S. 143, 
manages student access to curriculum materials in audio form via Bookshare, a federally funded program providing access to 
audio books for students with IEPs. Furthermore, we are expanding our use of the Collaborative Strategic Reading technique, 
which was piloted in bilingual social studies classes this year. Students learn this protocol which allows them to collaboratively 
make meaning of non-fiction texts as well as reflect on the strategies they employed to do so. Using CSR puts students firmly 
at the center of their own learning and fosters independence among ELLs by teaching them strategies that they can use for 
reading in all subject areas. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 The school program is designed to afford selected students, with special needs, with an opportunity to participate in general 
education classrooms and special classes.  The curriculums are developed with an array of engaging materials and teachers are 
provided with professional development geared towards differentiated instruction and strategic teaching practices.  Teachers 
also participate in intervisitiation practices to further enhance their teaching of ELLs in least restrictive environments. All 
students in the special education department at I.S. 143 are mainstreamed with their non-disabled peers in the following areas 
of the school day to the greatest extent possible:  use of  computer lab, science lab programs, physical education program, 
field trips, and lunch.  Some students with disabilities need to have the support of a special education teacher, a program 
paraprofessional, crisis paraprofessional, health paraprofessional, or an orientation mobility paraprofessional to assist them 
with addressing their specific needs to allow them to participate within a mainstream environment. Students with disabilities 
are also included in after school and Saturday programs.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
  We are currently using the following intervention programs during our daily program,  after school program, and 
Saturday  program: independent reading technology program MYON,  I-Ready individualized-CCLS aligned computer program 
for both math and reading. We also focus on improving reading proficiency with explicit, direct instruction in fluency, 
vocabulary, and comprehension.  Students will read leveled, high interest literature for both academic and recreational 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63 

 

purposes with scaffolds to afford an opportunity for ongoing development and progress.  I-Ready math is provided to the 
students in English while specific content area reading is provided in Spanish to those students participating in our bilingual 
program. Our science and math teachers participated in STEM professional development and have been approaching science 
and math with its holistic approach, which incorporates literacy and structured opportunities for listening, speaking and 
writing while building the content knowledge.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 During the upcoming year we will be focusing on modifying the units of study that incorporate various genres and types of 
writing with the implementation of the CCSS in order to meet our ELLs needs. We are focusing on our instructional core - 
Advanced Literacy through a series of workshops administration attended during the current school year. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Paste response to question here:  N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
  All of our ELLs are afforded with the opportunity to participate in after school programs and supplemental services. They are 
provided with the information for all programs in a timely fashion.  Their parents are also invited to attend an information 
session.  Parents are also called to be informed of other programs, such as Title III  after school program held Wednesdays and 
Thursdays from 2:20- 4:00 with a specific focus on literacy and math through use of technology.  The students are invited/ 
parents are informed in writing in the parents' preferred language.  All ELLs that are invited participate in after school 
programs. Other non student-specific programs that are offered to all students include the after school Champs program, and 
Catholic Charities.      
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We provide all of our ELLs with supports through the use of  Smart Board technology, MYON, I-Ready, computer  labs, laptop 
carts and IPad carts available in all classes, Science Technology Engineer Mathematics (STEM) and guided instruction.     
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 Home language arts is an integral part of each of our bilingual program.  Students receive Home language arts weekly as part 
of their program.  Home language arts is offered to ELLs in our bilingual program where they participate in content rich 
instruction with literature that is relevant and aligned to the Common Core State Standards. Students in our free-standing ENL 
(FENL) program receive support in their home language through use of bilingual glossaries and texts in their home language as 
much as possible. Our bilingual teachers that teach FENL also provide oral and written support.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The required services support and resources correspond to the ELLs of all age levels and grade levels. We focus on grade level 
according to Common Core State Standards.   The materials used have been selected in accordance to students 
needs.  Academic supplemental services as well as instructional practices are held in accordance to each grade level.  We 
review all texts to ensure they are age appropriate and do our best from for using materials that might be the appropriate 
proficiency levels for the students but are not of the appropriate age level.  Services are differentiated according to need and 
the students are regularly assessed to determine growth and movement as all of our programs have weekly and monthly 
embedded assessments.  Many of the technology programs such as our use of I-Ready are  appropriate for our ELLs and our 
students with disabilities by meeting the cognitive needs of our students while being the appropriate ages/grades for our 
students and assessing the students with each use.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64 

 

 

 During the Building Council meetings the administrators of both schools ensure that the building resources, such  as the gym, 
auditorium and other shared spaces are equally used. We also included the CBO's to ensure that all ELLs are included and their 
academic. linguistic and socio-emotional needs are met. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 Our new arrivals are usually enrolled in our school after the start of the school year; therefore we do not provide activities 
prior to the commencement of the school year. Throughout the year new ELLs are invited to an orientation and are included 
and invited to all school activities.      
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

 We currently do not offer language electives.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All teachers participate in professional development for at least three times a week.   The focus of the professional 
development is determined by student and teacher needs.  Our recent focus has been on differentiated instruction, strategic 
teaching and alignment to the Common Core State Standards. We also have professional development provided twice a year 
by I-Ready to further assist our analysis of data in order to drive instruction. All of our administrators, paraprofessionals, 
guidance counselors,  speech therapists, and our parent coordinator participate in professional development sessions weekly, 
at the school level, and through various offerings through NYCDOE.  Our school-wide PD offering take place every Monday 
afternoon from 2:20 - 3:40 and it is based on needs assessment.  To support our ELLs as they engage in the Common Core 
Learning Standards in addition to our weekly professional development sessions Our math and science teachers (including our 
Bilingual teachers) participate in STEM professional development once a week and throughout the year from outside 
facilitators .  Our staff is provided with specific techniques and skills to help our students transition from elementary school to 
middle school.  They are also provided with an overview of each child's academic progress and need. Our school guidance 
counselors also have workshops and assemblies to provide our students with guidance and an overview of what is expected of 
them in junior high school and what they are to expected to do in high school.  School staff, such as guidance counselors, are 
further supported by school administrators by incorporating them in the professional development that are held throughout 
the school.  They are also included to participate in professional learning team meetings to discuss and share ideas pertaining 
to ELLs.  
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include

how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
  To meet the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2  teachers are provided with ELL specific 
professional development in the school as well as provided opportunities to attend professional development provided by the 
district, and the office of ELLs/ NYCDOE.   Teachers are notified prior to the event and given a copy of the agenda, which is also 
posted in the main office.  A sign-in sheet is used to confirm attendance and filed as proof of participation.    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
  As part of CR Part 154.2 parents are invited for a one to one meeting (in parents' preferred language) to discuss language 
development,  goals of the program,  assessment results and student progress. The majority of the meetings take place on 
Tuesday afternoons during the extended time allocated for parents. Other meetings are scheduled to ensure all parents are 
able to attend. Interpretation and translation services are provided as needed in the preferred language. A record of such 
meetings is recorded as well as what was discussed and next steps.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

  I.S. 143 provides numerous opportunities for parents to become involved in the school. In addition to the scheduled 
Parent/Teacher conferences four times a year, we also use an online program called Jupiter Grades to provide the families 
with an opportunity to continuously have access to their child’s academic progress, and where they can freely communicate 
with any of their child’s teachers at any time in their preferred language.  The program provides the parents with a translation 
option to facilitate their understanding. Parents are encouraged to come into the school building throughout the year to 
discuss their child’s academic performance,  translations are provided to the parents when needed. We also have a Parents 
Association and a parent coordinator who provide the parents with information sessions (in the parents' preferred language) 
regarding the school's culture, progress, and continuity of services.  At the start of the school year,  I.S. 143 holds parent 
orientations to both introduce the faculty to the parents and welcome the parents.  We hold parent workshops once a month 
to get parents involved as well as teach the parents skills (in the parents' preferred language).  As part of CR Part 154.2 parents 
are invited for a one to one meeting (in parents' preferred language) to discuss language development, goals of the program, 
assessment results and student progress. Parental involvement in our school is gradually increasing.  We have had an increase 
in the number parents coming to our parent orientations, curriculum night and monthly parent workshops.   
 
Literacy coach Roseann Bayer facilitated a “Muffin and Joe” family workshop on the morning of October 18th. The first 
objective of the session was to familiarize parents/guardians with the web-based tools that students use in and out of the 
classroom to both assess and strengthen their reading skills. Parents were provided with log-in and usage information for 
iReady and Myon and saw a demonstration of both resources on a Smartboard. The second objective was to engage parents in 
an activity currently underway in ELA classes, namely, teaching students how to better articulate their personal reading 
preferences. English teachers have introduced “appeal terms,” words student use to describe the pace, mood, storyline and 
characterization of a book. Instead of describing a text, however, participants described a short animated wordless film using 
the appeal terms. Participants then examined different works of art and applied the appeal terms to describe them. They were 
asked to explain their choice of words, which resulted in a lively exchange of ideas. Because the subject matter was visual and 
the appeal terms were translated into Spanish, participants of all literacy levels could take part in the activity. At the 
conclusion of the session, parents visited several classrooms and observed use of iReady, Myon as well as other literacy 
lessons.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lakisha Mcdaniel Luke, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The following data and methodologies are used to assess the school’s written translation and oral interpretation 
needs: 

1. The Newly admitted students to the NYCDOE complete the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS). Part III 
of the HLIS lists the preferred language of the parent for both written and oral communication.  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70 

 

2. All Parents complete the Emergency contact cards and the school’s Learning Environment Survey, they are 
supported in this through the interpretation and translation services of the Parent Coordinator and other bilingual 
members of the staff. 

3. The increase in the number of students and families that are Spanish speaking such as the newly admitted ELLs 
are clear indicators of the need for translation and interpretation services in Spanish. 

4. The school maintains a record of the primary language of each student and this information is maintained in 
ATS and on the students’ emergency card. The majority of the parents request information in Spanish. The other 
language requested is English (including the parents of students whose home language is Arabic). 

5. As part of the school’s CEP planning with the School Leadership Team, the school addresses the language 
assistance needs, including: regular and timely provision of translated documents through either existing 
resources or the Translation and Interpretation Unit, timely provision of interpretation services at group and one-
on-one meetings upon request when such services are necessary for parents to communicate with teachers, 
guidance counselors, school nurse and/or other school staff regarding critical information about their child’s 
education; how it will provide those needs, the budgetary and staffing resources it is devoting to fulfill those 
needs, compliance with the notification requirements in Section VII of Chancellors’ Regulation A-663. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of an emergency all parents including limited - English - proficient families will be contacted via 
telephone, using Translation and Interpretation Unit, If necessary for languages other than English and Spanish.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

To ensure that all staff members are aware fo the goal of Chancellor's Regulation A-663, the school provides 
information via professional development, posts a sign in each of the most prominent covered languages, indicating 
the availability of interpretation services. A list of staff members who are able to assist with interpretation and 
translation is available to all staff, including the school's safety officers. The School’s safety plan contains procedures 
for ensuring that parents in need of language access services are not prevented from reaching the school’s 
administrative offices solely due to language barriers. The Staff is also informed of the  

 

Translation and Interpretation Unit and the Department’s website which provides information in each of the covered 
languages concerning the rights of parents to translation and interpretation services.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The school provides each parent whose primary language is a covered language and who require language assistance 
services with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding translation 
and interpretation services. We will obtain translated versions of this document, in the covered languages, through 
http://schools.nyc.gov/RulesPolicies/ParentBillofRights/default.htm.  

The School posts a sign in each of the most prominent covered languages, indicating the availability of interpretation 
services. A list of staff members who are able to assist with interpretation and translation is available to all staff, 
including the school's safety officers. We will obtain such translated signs, in the covered language through 
http://schools.nyc.gov/Offices/Translation/TipsandResources/Default.htm. When more than 10% of the children at 
the school speak a primary language that is neither English nor a covered language, we will obtain from the 
Translation and Interpretation Unit a translation into such language of the signage and forms required pursuant to 
this section and shall post and provide such forms in accordance with this section. The School will inform parents of 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           73 

 

the Department’s website which provides information in each of the covered languages concerning the rights of 
parents to translation and interpretation services.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services is gathered from parent surveys and parent 
reflections from the parent workshops, as well as informal feedback from parents. Based on informal feedback, the
