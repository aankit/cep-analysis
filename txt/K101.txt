Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our mission is to ensure that all students develop the skills they need to meet or exceed all academic standards. The 
faculty, staff, and students of P.S. 101 are the creators of the future, charged with ensuring a safe, happy environment 
where students are learning through purposeful and strategic instruction. We strive to help our students to become 
independent thinkers who are prepared for a continuously evolving world. 

Our vision includes the quest to develop 21st century minds. Our personalized and differentiated instructional focus 
nurtures multiple intelligences, and we meet the needs of every child through small group and tailored learning using 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

a data driven approach. We have one unified purpose, and believe that every child can succeed. As a result, we 
collaborate to cultivate critical thinking through effective planning, questioning and discussion, and a rigorous 
interdisciplinary curriculum. At P.S. 101, we are all responsible and accountable for every child’s academic, social and 
emotional development, and all students develop the courage to achieve academic excellence. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 101 is located in the Bath Beach section of South Brooklyn, in the heart of a multicultural community. It is a 
neighborhood elementary school that serves children in grades kindergarten through fifth. The school currently has 
885 students. English language learners account for 22% of the school’s population, and 21% are students with 
disabilities. The average attendance rate for the school year 2016-2017 was 96%. P.S. 101 is a well-developed school. 

As a college and career readiness school and in keeping with the Chancellor's regulations and the standards 
curriculum, we have integrated the areas of math, reading, writing, science, social studies, and technology into our 
daily curriculum. We believe that each child's unique needs and talents should be nurtured so that he or she will 
develop a passion for learning and acquire the skills needed for societal membership and meaningful employment. 
We provide our youngsters with a wide range of learning experiences in technology and the arts to create, explore, 
discover, and express thoughts and ideas. Our expansion of arts instruction nourishes our children’s minds and bodies 
as they use creative expression in visual art and performance to story-tell, act, dance, and appreciate music. 

P.S. 101 is a Model Technology School, and students use technology to bridge the classroom and the world around us. 
Our students are challenged by educators who are trained to teach with the use of SMARTBoards, Promethean 
Boards, touchscreen TVs, laptops, iPads, iPods, and software programs that enhance learning. We expect our students 
to achieve State Standards of Learning with rigorous tasks for independent practice and cooperative learning. Our 
eclectic literacy program includes comprehensive instruction with Orton-Gillingham methodology, authentic 
literature, skill/strategy development with Pearson’s ReadyGen, and The Writing Revolution Program. Mathematics is 
supported with our Go Math! instructional program, maintaining our high performing status in District 21 on state 
exams. 

 

At P.S. 101, our parents work with the school staff to encourage reading and higher level thinking skills, respect for 
oneself and one another, cultural awareness, and diversity. The entire school community works together towards 
achieving high performance standards. We believe that all children should be provided with all opportunities available 
to ensure they reach their full potentials. We are very happy and proud to have strong partnerships with Marquis 
Studios, Third Street Band, Penny Harvest, Xaverian High School, and Brooklyn College. 

On our Quality Review for 2015-2016, P.S. 101 was found to be Well Developed in ensuring engaging, rigorous, and 
coherent curricula in all subjects; developing teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs; aligning assessments to 
curricula, using on-going assessment and grading practices; establishing a culture for learning that communicates high 
expectations to staff, students, and families; and engaging in structured professional collaborations on teams. P.S. 101 
received a rating of Proficient in developing teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs. Our key areas of focus 
for 2018-2019 will be in Writing, continuing and enhancing our Leader in Me/Viking Pride Program, expanding our 
Orton-Gillingham Program to include all Special Education and ENL students, continuing and enhancing the teaching 
of metacognition to students, and continuing and enhancing our Parent Outreach Program. 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

English language learners account for 22% of the school’s population, and 21% are students with disabilities. 

Our ENL population often struggles with crossing the bridge from expanding to commanding levels. They may lag 
there for an extra year, while a few others will stagnate for even two years. They are often decent decoders, but not 
fluent readers. This subgroup needs frequent reading of on-level or 1+ level text with vocabulary scaffolds. The extra 
year at this level affords them the time to be exposed to and to acquire more vocabulary. However, if vocabulary is 
not explicitly taught and spiraled on, they struggle since they cannot absorb it holistically. Vocabulary in this case 
mostly means multi-meaning words, idioms and phrasal expressions (ex. pass out vs. individual words pass and out... 
together then mean something altogether different). There is a small newcomer subgroup comes from the minor 
Russian countries like Uzbekistan who also have special needs. Schooling in many parts of these countries have a 
delayed start at age 6-7, which is too young to be considered for SIFE status. The lack of literacy means more struggles 
in acquiring the four modalities of language. 

The Special Education population of P.S. 101 has many diverse needs and each child has an Individualized Education 
Plan specifically written to target their unique areas of need. Struggles with foundational literacy skills are often at the 
root of the problem for many of our students with learning disabilities. In particular decoding, that is being able to 
apply letter-sound relationships, patterns, and rules in order to correctly pronounce written words, is a deficit found 
and addressed in many re-occurring goals in our IEPs. For students in grades 3-5 issues with decoding still persist, but 
a common re-occurring goal is found addressing problems in reading comprehension that affect the student's ability 
to understand the meaning of words and passages.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Teacher feedback from a needs survey, Advance data, administrative observations, and current trends in education 
revealed the need to continue to improve student writing. Since the 2016-2017 school year, we have partnered with 
Dr. Judy Hochman and the Writing Revolution to improve our school's Writing program, improve teachers' 
professional development in Writing, and improve the quality of our students' writing. In 2016-2017, our students 
made a great deal of progress in Writing, especially on the state ELA exam. During the 2017-2018 school year, our 
students continued to make huge gains in the state Writing standards and were able to master more Writing skills. 
We, as a school, want to continue to provide the Writing Revolution instruction to our students so they can further 
advance in Writing.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June, 2019, 75% of our students in grades K through 5 will move at least one level in their overall writing grade from 
their baseline assessment score to their end-of-year assessment score using beginning of year assessment, middle of 
year assessment, and end of year assessment as benchmarks as demonstrated on their writing pieces collected by Dr. 
Judith Hochman.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

1. Use of The Writing Revolution 

The Writing Revolution gives teachers a proven, cost-effective 
and evidence-based instructional methodology, the Hochman 
Method. This system enables students to master the skills that 
are essential if they are to become competent writers. In turn, 
those skills equip students to become better readers, to 
communicate more effectively in writing and speaking, and most 
importantly, to elevate their thinking. Through the Hochman 
Method, teachers and instructional leaders learn to use specific 
writing strategies in all subjects, including ELA, social studies, 
science, and math, and in every grade. The Writing Revolution 
team will provide four professional learning development 
sessions for the entire staff. 

2. For students with special needs, we will utilize a SETSS model 
or we will use station teaching in an ICT co-teaching model. For 
our ELL students, we will use a push-in model with ELL teachers 
going into the regular education classroom. For our lowest 
achieving students who are not in Special Education (bottom 
third), Targeted Reading instruction in a small group setting will 
be utilized with our Reading specialists pushing in to the 
classrooms. 

3. Continued use of ReadyGen research-based instructional 
programs that utilize the Common Core Standards and conform 
to the Common Core Shifts.  

4. Regularly scheduled professional development will be 
provided by the Hochman Group to train, observe, and critique 
teachers on rigorous instruction. 5. School-wide teacher training 
(Master Classes) will be available and take place during weekly 
extended day professional development periods. 6. Select 
teachers will attend professional development meetings outside 
of school on a regular basis and turn-key information to the rest 
of the school staff. 7. Regular and on-going teacher inter-
visitations will take place.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

8. Regular and on-going teacher observations with feedback will 
be done by administration. 9. September: Baseline Writing (BOY) 
collected by Hochman February: Benchmark (MOY) collection 
May: End of Year (EOY) Writing collection by Hochman 10. 
Monthly Writing collection, September through June 11. Each 
month, sample student writing pieces will be looked at by the 
school Instructional Team. The Writing Team will give 
professional feedback to the Instructional Team on the collected 
Writing samples. This feedback will be turn-keyed to all teachers. 

12. In February, 2019, selected teachers and administrators were 
trained in the technique of comparative judgement, a strategy 
which uses a series of pairwise comparisons to establish a 
measurement scale. This strategy will be turn-keyed to other 
teachers. We will use this technique to assess more students' 
writing pieces and to asses student work more efficiently and 
effectively. 

 

 
 

 
3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
1. Parent workshops will be held with the teacher Writing specialists and the Parent Coordinator three times in the 
school year to educate parents on how to help their children at home with their writing. Copies of The Writing 
Revolution Guide will be given to the parents as well. Parents and guardians will be invited to the school for a 
Students as Authors Share-Out. 

2. Every bulletin board in the hallways of the school will show student work pertaining to the Writing Revolution 
initiative. Parents/guardians will be able to view these bulletin boards whenever they visit the school. 

3. Students will have a Writing goal in their Leader in Me binders. Parents/guardians will be able to peruse these 
binders during visits to the school and when the binders go home periodically.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

1. The Leader in Me Program is Franklin Covey’s whole school 
transformation process. It teaches 21st century leadership and 
life skills to students and creates a culture of student 
empowerment based on the idea that every child can be a 
leader. We at P.S. 101 have made a five-year commitment to this 
program, which will promote school-wide systems to improve 
student behavioral outcomes and build positive school climate 
and culture, and we will be in Phase 3 during the 2018-2019 
school year. This program will encompass a pro-active approach 
to establishing the behavioral supports and social culture within 
P.S. 101 that is needed for all students to achieve emotional, 
academic, and social success. Attention will be focused on 
creating and sustaining primary (school-wide), secondary 
(classroom), and tertiary (individual) systems of support that 
improve lifestyle results for our students. 

2. The Leader in Me Sub-Committees include The Lighthouse 
Team, The Lighthouse Ambassadors, The Bright Ideas, 
Destination Victories, Family Ties, The Little Lighthouse Team, 
The Wow Team,and The Funky Fun Bunch. These subcommittees 
will work to support the success of the program. 

3. All students in grades K through 5 will regularly conference 
with their teachers and track their own data which will be 
collected in data binders. Students will be tracking personal goals 
as well as academic goals including reading levels, reading tests, 
amount of books read, and math tests. 

4. Student Leader in Me Tracking Binders help students to 
navigate and track their goals and conference with their 
teachers.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Due to our large student population, administrative observations, teacher needs assessment feedback, and current 
trends in education, we saw the need to continue but refine our push-in co-teaching model in ELA with Special 
Education and ELL teachers to include the Orton-Gillingham instructional approach to reading, spelling, and writing. 
This theory combines multi-sensory techniques along with the structure of the English language. Those items taught 
include: phonemes and morphemes, such as prefixes, suffixes, and roots. Common spelling rules are introduced as 
well. Multi-sensory education incorporates the three learning pathways, which are: auditory, kinesthetic, and visual. 
This approach is beneficial for all learners. It can be implemented in a large group setting as well as with individuals, 
small groups, and at-risk populations. The approach allows for implementation of Response to Intervention (RTI) at all 
levels while allowing for differentiation of instruction. Trends over time in ELA performance on the state standardized 
test show an increase of 6% of students on or above in grade level due to the push-in co-teaching model. Studies 
show that with the co-teaching model, there is a greater impact on student achievement due to the enhanced 
instructional support students receive in the classroom, reduced student-to-teacher ratio, maximized time spent 
teaching, and shared expertise among two or more teachers.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June, 2019, 75% of our targeted lowest third and ENL students will meet or exceed individual benchmark objectives 
in Reading as determined by iReady assessments as a result of our Special Education and ENL teachers receiving training 
in the Orton-Gillingham Approach to Reading instruction.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The 2018 Framework Scores, as measured by the NYC School Survey data, revealed that our second to lowest score 
was in Rigorous Instruction with a score of 4.44. We wish to improve this score in the 2018-2019 school year. Teacher 
feedback from a needs survey, Advance data in 1A, 1E and 3B, administrative observations, and current trends in 
education led us at P.S. 101 to believe our students need to be challenged cognitively to succeed, and we believe that 
challenging students in the classroom starts with effective and highly effective teacher lesson planning and student 
engagement. We will be focusing on critical thinking through questioning and discourse, and we will have students 
complete tasks that are metacognitive in nature.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June, 2019, the principal/administration through professional development and teacher instruction will provide 
metacognition instruction to the students which will result in 50% of our students who are performing on a level 1, 2, or 
3 demonstrating a one-level increase in critical thinking as measured by benchmark tasks.

welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The 2018 Framework Scores, as measured by the NYC School Survery, data revealed that we are meeting Framework 
expectations with a score of 3.89, our lowest score in the Framework. Our goal is to exceed Framework expectations 
this school year. For the past ten years, P.S. 101 has been using the Orton-Gillingham Approach to Reading with 
considerable success in students' decoding and oral language skills. To capitalize upon this success and to target our 
English Language Learners, as well as to foster strong family and community ties, we saw a need to offer Parent 
Outreach ELL Orton-Gillingham workshops. These workshops will be another opportunity for parents and guardians to 
be welcomed into our school, to have parents/guardians foster bonds with their children, and to have our community 
use P.S. 101 as a resource for adults as well as children.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June, 2019, we will provide Parent Outreach ELL Orton-Gillingham workshops with our OG specialist which will result 
in a 2% increase, from 94% to 96%, in the percentage of parents who agree or strongly agree that parents get to visit 
the classroom or participate in an activity with their child as measured by the results of the 2019 NYC School Survey.

Section 6: Academic Intervention Services (AIS)  

(Required for All Schools) 

  

Directions: Schools need to maintain accurate records of students who are receiving Academic Intervention Services 
(AIS) to ensure that students who are not achieving proficiency receive effective and timely assistance. These records 
need to be made available upon request and indicate the total number of students receiving AIS in each subject area 
listed below and for each applicable grade in your school.

Kindergarten – grade 5 students receive 
intervention instruction as needed,as 
well as grade-appropriate instruction, to 
become more college and career ready. 
Vocabulary and comprehension skills 
and strategies are stressed in leveled 
readers. Test prep is also taught. Our 
academic intervention providers will 
continue to focus on aligning instruction 
to the Common Core State Standards. In 
the school year 2018- 2019, our school 
will continue to utilize an academic 
intervention teacher who is well-versed 
in the Orton-Gillingham methodology. 
This provider will work with SWD and 
at-risk students in order to strengthen 
the necessary phonemic and decoding 
skills required to learn how to read and 
write. “The Orton-Gillingham method is 
language-based and success-oriented. 
The student is directly taught reading, 
handwriting, and written expression as 
one logical body of knowledge. Learners 
move step-by-step from simple to more 
complex material in a sequential, logical 
manner that enables students to master 
important literacy skills. This 
comprehensive approach to reading 
instruction benefits all students.”

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 101, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary 
and Secondary School (ESEA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

P.S. 101’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The P.S. 
101 community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy 
with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input.  

 

P.S. 101 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

Our newest immigrant students, whose home language is other than English, are needing more 
exposure and support in understanding the English language. We would like to purchase 10 
licenses of the Imagine Learning educational software to support these ELLs.  This web program 
is unique because it houses differentiated English instruction in a child’s home language, of 
which 15 are supported.  Ongoing assessments remove this support as the child progresses.  This 
program would be used in class as supplemental support and students will be allowed to bring 
home their logins and out site ID to access at home. The purchase would be made as soon as the 
plan is approved and access would be given until the end of the school year.  
 
We will also open several instructional morning and after school programs to support our 
ELLs.  One program would be devoted to helping our ELLs become better readers through the 
Orton-Gillingham approach.  This program would target our Transitioning and Expanding ELLs, 
with potential to support our Commanding ELLs as well.  A minimum of two teachers would be 
hired to work with up to 15 students each.  Another program would be for building vocabulary 
and basic language in our newcomers. All Entering and emerging ELLs in grades 2 through 5 
would be invited. This program would fund one teacher for up to 15 ELLs. Both programs would 
commence in mid-October and go on till the end of April/mid-May, and will occur on 
Wednesday and Thursday mornings. 
 
Moreover, our new Dual Language Mandarin program in grade one and two would greatly 
benefit from the purchase of supplemental materials since it did not receive any funding to boost 
its curriculum.  Whether learning English or Chinese in this program, all 32 students on each 
grade need ample practice in each of the four language modalities in order to achieve 
fluency.  Curricular support materials such as vocabulary cards, posters, workbooks and 
reference materials would be made from the Better Chinese and China Sprout FAMIS 
vendor.   In addition to curricular supports, purchases would be made to fill out their Mandarin-
language library in varying levels and genres. These resources would be managed and utilized by 
our first and second grade dual language teacher, Ms. Katherine Wu throughout the year. We 
may also add a Mandarin support program in the afternoons once a week for one hour contingent 
on parent interest.

: During the week of February 5th, the three Dual Language classrooms (Ms. Jenny Wu of K3 
and Ms. Katherine Wu of 102 and 201) will host a Chinese New Year’s celebration to spread 
cultural awareness for the rest of the school and to honor our school’s large Chinese 
population.  Funds will be used to decorate the auditorium and dual language 
classrooms.  Parents will be invited via letters home and Remind/Class Dojo notices.  Often, the 
Elite After School community organization provides a lion dance for the entire school and its 
parent population to enjoy over two morning assemblies at no cost.  If this cost cannot be 
covered by Elite, we will use funds to hire a lion dance troupe to carry on the tradition. 
 
Towards the end of the year, PS101K often will host a multicultural potluck celebration to honor 
the multiple ethnic groups in our school.  In fact, our current ELL population belongs to over 15 
ethnic groups.  This occasion invites parents to our school to see the work we’ve done over the 
year.  Parent invitations will be issued as letters home and reminders will be sent via 
Remind/Class Dojo notices.  We also share each other’s cuisines and decorate accordingly. This 
festival happens during the first half of June for approximately 90 minutes midday.   We will use 
$300 towards this event, if a certain ethnicity is not represented in the refreshments or 
decoration.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
WRAP, Orton-Gillingham assessments, online iReady assessments and teacher-made ReadyGen assessments are being used to 
guide instructional planning for our early childhood ELLs.  Orton-Gillingham assessments, online iReady assessments and 
teacher-made ReadyGen assessments are used for our ELLs in grades 3 to 5. The data collected is used to analyze our ELLs’ 
abilities and to inform our teachers of student weaknesses and strengths. These assessments provide data that is essential to 
our schools instructional plan as it helps us decide on the goals for each individual student and reveals the weaknesses for 
which support is necessary. WRAP, OG, teacher-made ReadyGen assessments and even the results of the NYSITELL are the 
most helpful for revealing what our entering and emerging ELLs need.  iReady, beginning-of-the-year grade-level assessments 
and classwork, and the prior year's NYSESLAT results are used to help inform our work for transitioning, expanding and 
commanding students.    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teachers have been trained to use WRAP and iReady by representatives of these programs, or at least turn keyed to by a staff 
who has attended the appropriate professional development.  The literacy coach now continues to support our K-2 staff with 
our efforts to WRAP our students appropriately while our tech coach monitors school-wide usage of the iReady program to 
ensure fidelity and minimize inappropriate use by students (i.e. jumping through assessments too quickly, stalling on failed 
exams). For Orton-Gillingham, our staff has been trained formally by an OG master teacher, Mrs. Ann Edwards, over the years, 
and continue to receive ongoing support from our in-house OG specialist, Mrs. McGinn.  All results are shared with the ENL 
staff during grade meetings or informal teacher meetings to guide instructional planning.  We look for patterns of strengths 
and weaknesses to address in lessons and projects, and this is done frequently throughout the year in an ongoing cyclical 
basis. For teacher-made curriculum-embedded ReadyGen assessments, ENL staff attend major planning sessions at the end of 
the year to have input over the overall curriculum map and plan.  More specifically, the integrated curriculum for 
commanding, expanding and transitioning ELLs is often modified or supported with the help of ENL teachers in response to 
their ability levels when possible.  For entering and emerging ELLs, we often substitute grade-level work with related activities 
that develop and build their burgeoning language development. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We take a three-pronged approach to this by comparing our previous year’s NYSESLAT data, state exam/end of (prior) year 
curriculum assessments. and our iReady assessment data.  With the prior year NYSESLAT  data, we use the EDAT tool to look 
for patterns in our ELLs’ strengths and weaknesses to establish a partial picture of their baseline data.  We also mine for 
students who have multiple risk factors so that we can apply tailored instructional supports for this group, and/or invite them 
into Title III programs for extra support.  If necessary and when appropriate, we also refer them for at-risk support services. 
With our iReady data, we identify their baseline and progress data to analyze for areas of need. These tests are given in 
September (baseline), November (progress), February(progress), March/April (progress) and June (summative). It is able to 
capture information on student progress and needs in phonemic awareness, high frequency words, phonics, vocabulary, 
fluency and comprehension in both informative texts and literature. Our teachers also complement this data with information 
from curriculum-embedded assessments and data points from OG and WRAP as appropriate.  (For example, if a child is making 
low progress in the reading modality, iReady can be used to narrow down whether the weakness is in phonemic awareness, 
phonics, vocabulary, high frequency words, fluency, or comprehension.  Then OG can be used to figure what specific skill 
deficit there is if it’s based on decoding concerns, WRAP if for vocabulary and fluency, and ReadyGen tests if a weakness in 
comprehension is detected. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The ENL staff gathers during common planning time to analyze the data.  Our results are turn keyed to the administration and 
then to the instructional team meeting (which consists of grade leaders and other team leads).  This in turn is relayed to the 
rest of the staff for reflection and incorporation into our lesson planning and instructional initiatives. Once the desired 
interventions are decided upon, we reinforce our core lessons, provide tailored instruction based on this data and develop 
Title III early morning and/or after school programs for our ELLs.  We relay these decision and fine tune them with 
administrator approval, and often rework them as the year progresses and data changes.  When funding allows, we even 
recruit Marquis Studios to help develop other programs that provide extra-curricular support.  If necessary and when 
appropriate, we also refer our neediest students for at-risk support services within the RtI framework.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
    
 
   When a child’s iReady/WRAP data reveals significant needs, and the classroom and ENL teacher corroborate their anecdotes 
and curriculum-embedded data for an ELL needing interventions, we will alter instruction for that ELL within the RtI 
framework.  We look at the history of that child and what their linguistic and cultural background is like, and then analyze what 
they have already learned with a lens on language acquisition.  This data reveals what kinds of native language support may be 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

needed, deficits in specific skills and competencies, motivational concerns, etc.  Our teachers, ENL staff and RtI team then 
work together to create possible strategies for tailored instruction and/or support in a small group or 1:1 arrangement.  We 
also recruit the parents in the entire process so that they are aware of their child’s struggles and can become a better 
informed participant. Many times we are able to avoid a referral, but if progress continues to lag, we will recruit the IEP team 
to move forward to an evaluation only after the 3 tiers have been completed.  
   It is paramount that appropriate care is taken to guide instructional decisions made on behalf of our ELLs without the 
Response to Intervention (RtI) framework.  Oftentimes, the signs of a student struggling with second language acquisition 
mimic those of a student with a Learning Disability (LD). For this reason, evidence suggests that ELLs identified as students with 
disabilities (SWD) are oftentimes struggling with issues that did not stem from LDs.  However, following the protocols outlined 
in the OELL’s RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs has helped our school design a more effective instructional program. 
   All ENL instruction is delivered within Tier I using rigorous and evidence-based methods. When a teacher is concerned about 
an ELL’s performance, data is gathered to back up that concern.  If there is a considerable gap between grade expectations and 
a student’s performance (with respect to an ELL’s time in the country), the ENL teacher will step in to assess or share the 
student’s progress in meeting his or her english language acquisition goals.  This is done by developing a portfolio of project-
based assessments (and rubrics), notebook checks, and ENL program assessments, whenever applicable.  
   If at this point an ELL is deemed at-risk, then specific prevention and intervention efforts are used to support them.  In Tier II, 
both the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher will provide extra educational opportunities to target the ELL’s needs either 
through small groups during regular classroom instruction, during extended day or recommendation into a morning/after 
school program.  In about 4-6 weeks, the student is reevaluated for progress.  If insufficient progress is made, then the child 
will be recommended for intensive and individualized instruction either through small groups via OG and/or Reading/Math 
club. It is in our interest to work systematically when addressing at-risk ELLs so that inappropriate referrals are avoided. 
 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Our school referred to the NYSESLAT and the ELA/Math state exam to evaluate and inform our ELL programs.  Depending on 
student performance on the NYSESLAT, ELLs are placed into specific classes so that they can receive integrated ENL instruction 
from a certified pedagogue.  Entering and emerging students receive standalone ENL instruction in a pull out setting.  Then the 
ELA and Math state exam performance help both classroom and ENL teachers tailor the core program to support our 
ELLs.  This can affect certain class arrangements for grouping, focus on vocabulary and language structure for content area 
texts, type of learning strategies taught, etc.  
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 The ENL staff disseminates its findings regularly to the administration and then the department lead presents them at the 
instructional team meeting (which consists of grade leaders and other team leads).  At the instructional team meeting, 
administrators and grade leaders work together to address the needs and progress concerns that are revealed by the ENL 
staff’s analysis of the data. Grade leaders then take this information and relays it to the rest of the grade so that everyone is 
aware of our ELLs’ progress and needs, and the adjustments we wish to implement as a team

 A majority of our ELLs are serviced using a Freestanding ENL program.  In Kindergarten, Ms. Lupo services 25 ELLs 
with a self-contained model.  She is dually certified as an early childhood teacher and as an ENL teacher.  Ms. Zollo 
services any IEP kindergartener in her ICT class with a self-contained model.  She holds a special education license and 
an ENL license.  Both standalone and integrated ENL services are provided in the classroom.  The standalone 
instruction is provided using small group instruction during the literacy block. 
 
In grades 1 through 5, four ENL teachers provide push in and pull out services.  Ms. Grace Siggia works with grade 1 
and 2. Ms. Patricia DeMarco is assigned to grade 3 and 4.  Ms. Rivera provides services for grades 4 and 5.  Each grade 
has two to three classes to which ELLs are registered.  We’ve broken up our ELLs among multiple classes on the grade 
to support our burgeoning ELL population. They are dispersed in equal numbers into each class and heterogeneously 
mixed as per NYSESLAT levels. Students who are of the Entering and Emerging level receive 180 minutes of standalone 
ENL services in a pull out setting in addition to another 180 minutes of integrated ENL services in a push in model. Pull 
out classes are combined for grades 1- 2, and 3 - 4. Transitioning and Expanding students receive 180 minutes of 
integrated ENL services via a push in model.  One and two year FELLs are also in the same classes. 
 
Our school is organized to ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes is delivered within our ENL 
program according to their proficiency levels in each program model.  During the first few days of the school year, our 
ELL population is identified either through the intake process/ELL identification process for new students or by 
combing over the RLAT report.  The ENL staff then completes their roster with their ELLs’ NYSESLAT levels and 
biographical data, and systematically organizes their schedules to make certain that each child receives the mandated 
minutes as per CR Part 154.2. 
 
In classrooms where we are using the Freestanding ENL program model, standalone ENL instructional minutes are 
delivered in four 45-minute blocks per week in a pull-out setting, while integrated ENL/ELA instructional minutes are 
delivered in four 45-minutes in a push-in setting in a general education class.  The ENL teacher using a co-teaching 
model and works in conjunction with the classroom teacher to provide instruction. As for HLA instructional minutes, 
each child must receive 75% of their instruction in English, while the remaining 25% should be conducted in their 
home language. Students are encouraged to use both English and their native language to work out their 
understanding of content area subject matter. Whenever possible, the ENL teacher will use explicit instruction to 
teach Tier II words so that domain-specific language/vocabulary (i.e. math – add, sum, increase by) can be better 
understood in the context of understanding new concepts in math, science, social studies and the English language 
arts. Students are also given a bilingual dictionary if they literate in their first language, and they are taught to use the 
bilingual glossaries provided by the NYS Office of Bilingual Education and Foreign Language Studies. To better align 
ENL instruction with content area instruction, curriculum maps are distributed and discussed during teacher 
articulation periods and possible ENL strategies are listed on the map for implementation.  Furthermore, as a 21st 
century school, we like to use technology.  This is manifested through iPod touches that are equipped with the Google 
Translate app or our vocabulary games, which many have native language support built into their  system.

In kindergarten and first grade, 12-13 students in each grade are serviced using the dual language model for Mandarin 
Chinese.  The ELLs in these classes receive their ENL services (both integrated and standalone) in this class.  The 
standalone portion is provided in a small group setting in the class during part of the literacy block. For this portion, 
the class is broken up into groups and students cycle through various activites at the teacher’s guidance.  One group 
would meet directly with the teacher, while another group works independently on an activity with some supervision 
by a student teacher.  The third group would be on a technology device at a 1:1 ratio to access a highly structured, 
individually differentiated program such as RAZ Kids or iReady.  Although the class is hetereogeneously grouped as a 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

whole, these small groups allow for targeted instruction by ability level. The students at Entering and Emerging levels 
of the NYSESLAT will meet during this time with the teacher for standalone ENL instruction. This time would add up to 
180 minutes over the week.  We use a rollercoaster setting over a 10 day period to ensure an even 50/50 split among 
the two languages.  This is applicable also to the other content areas: math, science and social students. Ms. Jenny 
Wu services kindergarten while Ms. Katherine Wu services first grade. This program began during the 2016-17 school 
year. 
 
 
  

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

       
In classrooms where we are using the Freestanding ENL program model, standalone ENL instructional minutes are delivered in 
four 45-minute blocks per week in a pull-out setting, while integrated ENL/ELA instructional minutes are delivered in four 45-
minutes in a push-in setting in a general education class.  The ENL teacher using a co-teaching model and works in conjunction 
with the classroom teacher to provide instruction. As for HLA instructional minutes, each child must receive 75% of their 
instruction in English, while the remaining 25% should be conducted in their home language. Students are encouraged to use 
both English and their native language to work out their understanding of content area subject matter. Whenever possible, the 
ESL teacher will use explicit instruction to teach Tier II words so that domain-specific language/vocabulary (i.e. math – add, 
sum, increase by) can be better understood in the context of understanding new concepts in math, science, social studies and 
the English language arts. Students are also given a bilingual dictionary if they literate in their first language, and they are 
taught to use the bilingual glossaries provided by the NYS Office of Bilingual Education and Foreign Language Studies. To better 
align ENL instruction with content area instruction, curriculum maps are distributed and discussed during teacher articulation 
periods and possible ESL strategies are listed on the map for implementation.  Furthermore, as a 21st century school, we like 
to use technology.  This is manifested through iPod touches that are equipped with the Google Translate app or our vocabulary 
games, which many have native language support built into their  system. 
 
In our Dual Language classes, English and Mandarin are provided in a self-contained model with a 50/50 balance.  ELLs who are 
of the Entering and Emerging level received four 45 minute blocks of ENL instruction each week in a small group during the 
literacy block.  ELA is delivered in an integrated setting during the other 90 minute blocks 2-3 times a week for all ELLs (and 
non-ELLs) in a heterogeneous environment.  HLA minutes occur during the other 90 minute literacy blocks 2-3 times a 
week.  (We use a rollercoaster setting over a 10 day period to ensure an even 50/50 split among the two languages.  This is 
applicable also to the other content areas: math, science and social students.)   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  
Just as the program model at PS 101K is specifically tailored for each group and level, grade-appropriate content area 
instruction is integrated into our ENL lessons during pull out sessions while ENL strategies and methods are used to scaffold 
content area instruction in the push in classroom. This effort cements academic rigor into our curriculum, and ensures that we 
amplify, not simplify, our instruction and that our program helps accelerate ELL learning so that they may achieve academic 
success.  
 
Additionally, research-based ESL methodologies and instructional strategies are applied in accordance to the new Common 
Core Learning Standards.  To elaborate, the CCSS ask students to read a better balance of literacy and informational texts (Shift 
1).  To adjust for this, ELLs are introduced to a body of topically similar ideas so that they are able to absorb academic 
vocabulary through multiple exposures (Shift 6) - a strategy that is highly supported by research.  In this way, ELLs are also able 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

to access more complex texts over time (Shift 3) and build on their background knowledge through the text (Shift 2). Writing is 
another modality that has experienced some "shifts" as a result of the CCSS.  After comprehending texts, ELLs are taught 
through clear and consistent routines on how to use the text when speaking and writing so that they can engage in evidence-
based discussions (Shift 4 and 5).  They are also scaffolded through this process with graphic organizers, sentence starters, 
cloze paragraphs, vocabulary dictionaries, etc.  Other research-based strategies are used by our ESL pedagogues and classroom 
teachers to help our ELLs succeed.  These include but are not limited to our juicy text initiatives, deconstructing and 
reconstructing sentences, analyzing figurative language, small group instruction, interactive word walls, Orton-Gillingham 
approach for systematic decoding, metacognition, and self-monitoring strategies.  We strive to make content comprehensible 
to enrich language development.  In addition, we use technology, field trips and other presentation methods to help make 
learning more authentic, personal and engaging.  These include the use of manipulatives, photographs and videos to both 
teach and allow students to demonstrate their knowledge; project-based assessments; Skype with experts or other classrooms 
around the world; blogging; Google classrooms; Aurasma; ClassKick and personal dictionaries.  Every ENL teacher is also 
equipped to track and analyze data via WRAP and iReady so that they can inform their instruction and adjust the strategies 
and methods used in the classroom.  (Data sources include curriculum-embedded Ready Gen assessments, project rubrics, 
NYSESLAT, iReady, WRAP,  and the Reading A-Z ELL Component.) 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

ELLs are evaluated in the native languages when appropriate and available.  If the child becomes an ELL as per the NYSITELL 
results and speaks Spanish at home, an ESL pedagogue and a translator administer the Spanish Lab.  If a pedagogue or staff 
member is on hand that speakers the same home language as the child, that person will speak with the child to informally 
assess their knowledge of the native language and welcome them to a our school.  In this way, that child have knowledge of 
who speaks their language in the school should a need arise.  During state exams, translated versions of the tests are made 
available to Chinese-, Spanish- and Russian-speaking ELLs.  ELLs are encouraged to write their responses in their native 
languages if it is more comfortable for them. In addition, bilingual glossaries are printed out in the languages made available by 
the DOE testing website and distributed.  If a child speaks a language for which we do not have an in-house translator, we will 
contact the Language Translation and Interpretation Unit.           
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 
a. SIFE 
At the time of this writing, PS 101 does not have any SIFE students enrolled our school.  However, SIFE students would be 
provided with extra support within the mainstream classrooms and during the child’s ESL/ENL program. ESL/ENL providers and 
classroom teachers create special goals for each student and monitor his or her progress along the second language 
acquisition continuum. Depending on the child, they may also focus on teaching the SIFE student’s socialization skills so that 
they may adapt more comfortably to the American school environment. During class time, differentiation occurs in the 
process, product and content. For instance, ESL providers use interactive white boards to provide visual support for more 
difficult concepts in a highly engaging manner. Homework assignments are tailored to their readiness levels. Reading and math 
club teachers may pick them up to increase their time spent in smaller group settings. Buddies and heterogeneous grouping 
may be used to facilitate learning. Furthermore, SIFE students are encouraged to enroll in morning and afterschool programs 
to help them log in extra learning time to make up for deficits. Our school also has numerous technology programs that can be 
tailored for individualized support and language/math development for our students, and many of these programs can be 
used at home.  
 
b. Newcomer 
Newcomers are identified as ELLs who have spent three years or less in the NYC school system. Typically, they arrive with 
extremely limited literacy skills (according to their NYSITELL results) and need targeted instruction in phonemic awareness and 
decoding. Both the ESL provider and classroom teacher use the Orton-Gillingham approach to meet this need. Furthermore, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

vocabulary and content area instruction starts immediately since research proves that students do not need to be able to read 
or write fluently prior to learning the subject matter. They do not even need basic language to interact with higher level 
concepts if there are certain scaffolds implemented (i.e. translations, pictures). This is especially important since ELLs receive 
only one grace year prior to taking the ELA state exam, and ENL providers must therefore work conscientiously and effectively 
with the student to ensure that they have necessary skills to be successful on the ELA exam within two years. Where possible, 
the test language is used during the regular school day to help familiarize students with the jargon.  This can be seen when 
answering text dependent questions in discussions and during the production of evidence-based writing in both literacy and 
content area instruction. Cloze passages and sentence frames have been especially helpful. 
 
c. Developing 
ELLs receiving service four to six years are analyzed for the language modality in which they are weak in and may then be 
targeted with additional intervention services as is appropriate along the RtI Framework. Phonics instruction, academic 
language, comprehension, grammar and writing skills can be provided in small group instruction during the regular day. These 
students are also encouraged to attend our Title III programs that review skills in reading and math in preparation for state 
exams. 
 
d. Long Term 
PS 101K currently does not have any students who fits this population. 
 
e. Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status 
FELLs who have tested proficient within the last year or two receive continual support in several ways. First, we continue to 
provide them with two additional years of transitional support 90 minutes a week.  Second, ELL testing accommodations 
would continue as mandated. This includes translated versions of the test where available and access to bilingual 
glossaries.  Third, if a FELL would benefit from current supplementary services for ELLs, such as through our after school ENL 
test preparation program, we would try to enroll them into that program.  This is especially helpful for FELLs who continue to 
have gaps in knowledge or vocabulary.  Fourth, continued articulation between the FELL’s classroom teacher and an ENL 
pedagogue could help the child receive additional scaffolds.  It is in our best interest to continue to support our FELLs because 
research has proven that ELLs can outperform their native English-speaking peers once they have achieved mastery in English. 
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
For each ELL identified with special needs (ELL-SWD), ENL providers meet with Regular Ed, Special Ed, and related SETTS 
providers to discuss the goals and modifications on the individualized educational plan (IEP). The ENL provided also sits in on 
all major IEP meetings with the IEP team.  We check to make certain that the language goals are on the plan are rigorous, but 
attainable. Since these students are expected to take the state exam at their grade level, the ELL teacher will work in 
conjunction with their Special Education and Regular Education classroom teacher to help modify grade level materials in each 
of the content areas to fit their needs. Student goals come to fruition through deliberate efforts to differentiate and/or 
scaffold every lesson while keeping in mind the grade-level expectations/IEP goals.  Typically at PS 101K, ELL-SWDs do not 
need help speaking and listening, but they do require remediation in reading and writing.  The Orton-Gillingham approach is a 
very well-researched and is a proven method of helping students with learning disabilities overcome reading and writing 
difficulties, particularly for dyslexia. For this reason, administration has had each of the ENL pedagogues trained in the 
approach to help develop such students.  Even our upper grade ICT/Special Education teachers are participating in weekly PDs 
to tap into this foundational program this year.  (Traditionally, it had been reserved for our K-2 teachers, but we are now 
planning to be more strategic with our services.) Our school has also purchased the Wordy Wise program to help develop 
vocabulary and background knowledge to accelerate reading and writing skills. This program provides visual supports and 
spirals on itself to help students retain new words and concepts learned. Furthermore, our school is now embarking on year 
two of training in the Hochman Writing Revolutions program, which is a systematic and formulaic approach to writing.  Its 
benefits overlap into the other three modalities since the format is highly structured and builds upon itself in such a way that 
makes sense to ELL-SWDs.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELL pedagogues may also refer to the school psychologist and/or social worker determine if the child’s needs are indeed a 
language issue or something more.  The ReadyGen and GoMath curriculums used in our school are extremely rigorous.  If the 
material proves too complex, the ESL teacher, classroom teacher and Special Education teacher may collaboratively decide to 
use the curriculum material from the previous grade but refer to the CCSS to make sure that while the text becomes more 
accessible, the task and expectations remain on grade. The IEP is central to deciding how and what kind of instruction to 
deliver with regards to maintaining the least restrictive environment.  Parent meetings are also held to include and support 
parents in helping to create a successful academic experience. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The targeted intervention programs at PS 101K for ELLs are all offered in English as follows: 
• Newcomer ELLs Morning Support Program: This program uses the “On Our Way to Reading” program by Continental to guide 
ELLs through basic language skills in the beginning of the year, and then moves on to Carson Dellosa's “Reading for 
Understanding” Level C/D by the end of the school year.  It has been very supportive of students with less than two years of 
English language instruction obtain the foundations of the English language.  This includes but is certainly not limited to 
phonics, decoding, oral expression and sight words. Text topics covered span all content areas with increasing difficulty as the 
curriculum progresses. This program meets four days a week for 45 minutes in the morning. 
• TASC: All students in grades 4 and 5 are encouraged to participate in this program. Students attend this program Monday 
through Thursday from 2:35 – 4:05 PM. On Mondays and Tuesdays, ELLs receive 90 minutes of targeted instruction in 
preparation of the state examinations. Teachers review content area material with a focus on language development skills and 
test-taking strategies. On Wednesdays and Thursdays, students take part in extracurricular activities, such as yoga, martial arts, 
dancing, etc. These enrichment activities are wonderful for building students’ background knowledge and socialization skills. 
Students are grouped by grade or special needs. 
• Math Club: Since success on the Math State Exam is reliant on students’ reading comprehension skills, ELLs may join Mrs. 
Rose Brocato for Math Club. In this program, the RtI math teacher focuses on developing problem-solving skills and 
understanding of the domain-specific language used in this content area.           
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Since iReady was introduced two years ago to our school, our scores on major state exams have been climbing.  Next year, we 
have recruited our technology lead to help track student usage to ensure better fidelity to the program for both assessment 
and individualized lessons.  Previously, we had left it to teacher choice to aim for certain goal use in our pilot year.  This year, it 
will be required that students have access to iReady for lessons 90 minutes a week since classes that did conform to this 
suggestions greatly outperformed other classes that did not. 
 
We have also completed year one of Hochman’s Writing Revolution program.  Anecdotes from teacher evaluations of this 
year’s student work on assessments and classwork have noted considerable improvement in student abilities to articulate and 
formulate both written and oral responses to rigorous, text-dependent questions and essays.  The results have been reflected 
on the ELA exams, as well as the NYSESLAT writing results.  Since this first pilot year has been so successful, we will move on to 
year two’s staff development of the program. 
 
Also, our ELL population has been steadily increasing over the last year.  In 2015-16, we received 28 new admits.  In 2016-17, 
we received 44.  To address this trend, we are steering away from a half-time push in co-teaching model where our ELLs were 
mainly registered to one class on the grade.  This previous model allowed us to give more than the mandated time.  We now 
need to break them up over two or three classes (one or two general education and one ICT) to help ensure that we are 
providing ALL ELLs with their mandated ENL instructional minutes, since there are far too many on a grade to fit into one class. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Not applicable.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all programs at PS 101K. Most programs service students in class and provide opportunities 
for ALL students to participate regardless of language ability, race, etc.  This has been our standard practice. If the ENL teacher 
originally schedules services for the student during that program time, the teacher will make every effort to allow the child to 
attend the program by rescheduling their services. If there is limited enrollment, names are drawn by lottery with no special 
privileges granted to any group of students. After school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in our building include: 
• Marquis Studio (Video and Theater): This residency uses the drama to help students become confident speakers in the 
classroom.  Through creative movement and script writing lessons, students design and then act out their own script to their 
parent audience at the end of the residency.  The residency usually lasts for 13 weeks. 
• Fifth Grade Enrichment: Fifth grade teachers and other support staff offer students a 90-minute enrichment period to test 
out their interests in 10 different courses ranging from photography and cooking, to starting a business. Students select their 
top three choices and are placed accordingly. If a particular program is more popular, a lottery system is used. 
• TASC/21st Century: The After School Corporation and the Jewish Community Council of the Greater Coney Island have 
merged to create a performance arts and academic program so that all students have fair and efficient access to quality 
activities beyond the school day. We have received an extension of our grant so that P.S.101 students have the opportunity to 
gain a better understanding of the arts and instructional content areas. This program includes a four-day week schedule 
(Monday to Thursday) from 2:35 to 4:05 P.M. The instructional part of the week involves test sophistication on 
Monday/Tuesday cycle while the Wednesday/Thursday program provides enrichment in the performance arts, such as chorus, 
dance, drama, vocals and music (guitar/piano).           
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Teachers at PS 101K draw from a multitude of instructional materials to support ELLs. 
• Orton-Gillingham Approach (for phonics and phonemic awareness) 
• ReadyGen’s Scaffolding Handbook 
• Houghton Mifflin Harcourt GoMath! Manipulatives and Differentiated Centers 
• Authentic / Juicy Text Initiative: ELL teachers expose ELL students to advanced literature and techniques to help them 
become language watchers and expand vocabulary. This effort was spearheaded by Maryann Cucchiara of the Child’s First 
Network. 
• Common Core State Standards 
• ReadyGen and GoMath! Curriculum Maps 
• Hochman’s Writing Revolution 
• Reading A-Z and RAZ Kids (for leveled reading material) 
Technology: 
• SMART Boards/Promethean: Every classroom is equipped with one, sometimes two. 
• Elmo: This piece of equipment allows teachers to project a book onto an interactive board. 
• Software: GarageBand, iMovie, Microsoft Office Suite, iTunes 
• iPads and over 100 apps, such as Padlet, Aurasma, ClassKick, ShowMe Interactive 
• Laptops/Chromebooks 
• Internet & Web Apps: Google Classroom, Blogs, Wikis, Skype, Moodle, Gaggle, Padlet, or Cameras for taking photos and 
movies 
• Coding/Hour of Power 
• PebbleGo 
• BrainPop, BrainPop Jr. and BrainPop ESL           
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In classrooms where our ELLs participate in our Freestanding ESL program, the native language support is 25% of total 
instruction as mandated by CR Part 154. However, we find it more helpful if we can create a profile about the student’s 
knowledge of the native language before proceeding.  If the child becomes an ELL as per the NYSITELL results and speaks 
Spanish at home, an ESL pedagogue and a translator administer the Spanish Lab.  If the child speaks another language besides 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

Spanish, a pedagogue or staff member who can speak the same home language as the child will interview the child to 
informally assess their knowledge of the native language and welcome them to a our school.  In this way, that child have 
knowledge of who speaks their language in the school should a need arise. We also interview the parents at registration for 
the child’s literacy and fluency in the first language.  A student’s native language is very useful for developing English language 
skills. When meeting with parents, we stress that they continue exposing their child to their home language. Even if parents 
are unable to assist with homework, we encourage them to ask students questions about the school day, stories they have 
read and what they learned in their classes.  ESL and regular education classes incorporate the use of bilingual dictionaries and 
glossaries during instructional periods, test administration and many times during class projects. Students are also encouraged 
to include the translation on their vocabulary cards if they are able to write in their first language. Students who are English 
proficient and speak the ELL’s first language may be assigned as a buddy to help the ELL learn the rules and routines of a 
classroom. Technology is another element that helps support ELLs’ native languages since there are many bilingual apps to 
download into an iPod touch iPad and/or laptops, and translation services are even more substantial online than in physical 
dictionaries. 
 
In our Dual Language Mandarin classes, Mandarin and English are taught in a 50/50 split for all content areas.  Our dual 
language teachers administer an English and Mandarin assessment in math and literacy to establish baseline data on students’ 
knowledge in both languages.  A similar test is administered again in January/February and June.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

ELL providers make certain that support and resources correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels. ELL providers meet weekly 
during their C6 and classroom teachers to discuss/exchange teaching techniques, data and student success. For the push in 
model especially, ESL teachers plan in conjunction with the classroom teachers several times a week to build programs and 
materials that support their students.  The aim of these meetings is to align our goals with the CCSS, grade-level curriculum, 
classroom content material and to make sure that we are doing all that we can to maximize our ELLs’ success in the 
classroom.  When scheduling allows, the ESL/ENL teacher also joins the corresponding grade meeting.  
 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Not applicable.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Activities to assist newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year include the following: 
• The Parent Coordinator hosts welcoming workshops at the school. These workshops provide opportunities for parents to 
complete their paperwork and to ask questions about the school and its programs. 
• Kindergarten teachers, Parent Coordinator and the ENL teacher assigned to the grade host a Kindergarten Orientation for 
new registrants in April/May. 
• A parent orientation is held for all newly enrolled ELLs. This involve each of the ENL teachers, in-house translators or 
requested translators from the Language & Interpretation Units when necessary, and the parent coordinator (when available). 
At the beginning of the year, three orientations are held with one coinciding with Back-to-School Night.  As new admits enter 
our school during the year, parent orientations are scheduled during Tuesday’s parent time, or before and after school if that 
time is not convenient to the parent. We avoid scheduling these meetings during class time.  
• All parent letters are distributed in English, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, Urdu, Russian and any other languages made available 
by the DOE’s Translation Unit. These letters may welcome parents and students to the new school year, inform them of 
upcoming events, available community resources, etc. 
• All parents are given a copy of the Preferred Language Form to complete so that the school is informed of which language to 
send memos and contact parents with. This preference is also noted on their blue cards. 
• Parents are given information about the P.S.101 Website (www.ps101k.com).  This is another place where parents and 
students can access information about the school activities, classroom expectations for the up and coming school year, supply 
lists, etc. twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. There is also an option on the webpage to have it be translated into 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

other languages for increased accessibility by non-English speaking parents. 
• Newcomer Packets are printed off for use by ENL teachers for classroom teachers to help jumpstart their efforts to 
differentiate work for any new incoming ELLs. The packet includes worksheets, strategies, games and activities teachers can 
use with ELLs to help them develop their language skills. Some teachers use it to supplement their lessons while others use the 
worksheets as a way to differentiate their homework. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We currently do not offer any language electives to ELLs.  
  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

a. In our Dual Language classes, English and Mandarin instruction are provided in a self-contained model 
with a 50/50 balance.  We use a rollercoaster setting over a two-week period to ensure an even 50/50 
split among the two languages.  This is applicable to all content areas: math, science and social students. 
Both EPs and ELLs are integrated during the instructional day.  Entering and emerging ELLs do receive four 
45-minutes of small group instruction during the literacy block but this is simultaneously done as other 
advanced ELLs and EPs work in other small groups on other skills.  
b. Each core content area is delivered 50% in English and 50% in Mandarin. 
c. Certain days are prescribed as Mandarin in the morning and English in the afternoon.  Alternate days 
have English in the morning and Mandarin in the afternoon.  They are flip-flopped to avoid language 
exhaustion in the child who’s home language is not the targeted language.  The teacher does not permit 
mixed use of the languages during these times. 
d. We take a simultaneous approach to emergent literacy development.     
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
t PS 101K, we strive to maintain high standards for our students and our teachers.  Part of this effort includes sending our staff 
members to a multitude of professional developments (PDs) that are designed to help ELLs succeed in the academic setting or 
by providing them in-house during Monday Professional Development times.  Our PDs are also not just limited to ENL 
pedagogues, but are attended by all teachers of ELLs.  Intentionally, ENL pedagogues and oftentimes a regular education 
classroom teacher are paired off to attend a PD offered by either DELLSS, our BFSC or another academic institution.  In the 
past, this has included Fordham University, Hofstra, Google for Education, etc.  This information is then turn keyed to the 
appropriate teachers during grade meetings and/or common preps.  PDs are attended by ESL pedagogues (and their classroom 
teachers) on a rotating basis through the year as they are offered.  The DELLSS email blast is particularly useful for locating 
opportunities.  If specific information is deemed vital for the entire staff to learn (including non-pedagogic staff), 
administration will choose the appropriate ENL teacher to turnkey the information during a Lunch & Learn, orientation 
meeting, or after school presentation on Mondays. Specific PD offerings have included but are not limited to topics such as: 
OG, iReady, Google Classroom, eChalk, RAZ-Kids, Hochman Writing Revolution, metacognition, BIPs, etc. Additional PDs are 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

held by the BFSC for non-pedagogic staff such as our pupil accountant secretary and STARS personnel.  We send out a 
representative each of these meetings as they happen. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
All staff members participate in school-based PDs that benefit our ELLs, and are encouraged to attend other PDs off 
site.  Administration sends out email blasts to its staff that contain information on the city’s upcoming PDs.  Since our school 
supports a very prominent ELL and FELL population, many of these PDs focus on making academic language more 
comprehensible and accessible by students.  PDs are multi-year and on-going, and so our all of our staff members can meet 
the 7.5 hours of ELL training.  The ESL staff will also be hosting workshops to train classroom teachers on ESL techniques to 
help all teachers of ELLs bridge the gap between our ELLs' performance and curriculum expectations.  When a teacher returns 
from a PD, he or she submits the agenda from the meeting to administration for record-keeping purposes.  This agenda is kept 
in the teacher’s main office file.  Many times, administration also asks for a debriefing, or attends the turnkey session the 
teacher gives to their colleagues.   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
These annual individual meetings are held during the parent engagement period on Tuesdays. These meetings start in January 
and continue through February. Three to four parents are given appointments for each Tuesday by phone or letter the week 
before in English and their home language. If daytime hours are not convenient, then we can host a meeting over the 
phone.  An in-house translator will be made available, or the DOE Translation line will be utilized as needed.        
 
ENL teachers use this time to explain where the child's progress was at the beginning of the year, how far they have made 
gains and how much further they may need to go.  Irregardless of level, the ENL teacher will provide proof of their level and 
progress by presenting content area classwork, ENL work, and assessment grades.  Before the end of the meeting, a list of 
tailored tips and resources for next steps are provided to the parents for at-home support.    
 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

PS 101K is a Title I school which indicates that many of our parents fall below the federal poverty level. To make ends meet, 
many parents must take on two or more jobs and such schedules grant limited opportunities for school involvement. Still, our 
administration, Parent Coordinator and ESL staff makes every effort to offer an array of opportunities at all hours of the day 
and evenings for parents to get involved.  (We also provide translators on-site who are able to speak Cantonese, Mandarin, 
Spanish and Arabic so that parents have access to all activities.  Prior to workshop events, a survey is sent out and parents can 
note whether or not they need a translator on site or will bring a translator of their own).  Our school opportunities include: 
•                Parent Teacher Association: The PTA helps to raise funds to support academic achievement by enriching the learning 
environment.  Parents of all language abilities are invited to attend.  In fact, parents who have chosen to take part in this 
wonderful association speak a multitude of languages that is representative of our student population. 
•                Parent Teas: Teachers invite parents into the classroom to view the child’s learning environment and understand 
expectations.  By observing the routines and lessons, parents gain a better understanding of how to support their child. 
•                Parent Orientation Meetings: ELL teachers organize meetings to explain the 3 ESL models offered by the city, and in 
turn at PS101. Translators are available and the Parent Orientation Video is shown in their native language. We also go over 
the CCSS expectations and NYSESLAT. 
•                Back-to-School Night: The PTA and the administration organizes a night of events twice a year for parents to meet 
their child’s teacher, visit the classroom and view the work going on in schools. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

 

•                Family Nights: PS 101 loves sponsoring its family night, where students and parents are invited join in various 
activities designed to encourage parental involvement. Events have included Bingo Night, Movie Night, Pizza Night, Meet-and-
Greets, etc. 
•                Field Trips: Anytime there is a field trip, classroom teachers send letters home to all parents to ask for volunteers. It 
does not matter what language they speak.  All help is welcome. 
•                Homework Help Workshop: A teacher volunteer, typically the literacy coach, leads this workshop to instruct parents 
on how they can help their child complete their homework even if they feel like they are not knowledgeable of the subject 
areas.  
•                Application for Middle School Workshop: Translators are typically on hand to help parents and children negotiate 
applications. 
•                Student of the Month Breakfasts:  Our school selects students to honor them for their hard work and dedication 
once a month.  For them, a unique parent and child breakfast is held in the morning so that the school and parents can 
celebrate their achievement together.  
•                School Assemblies: A lot happens at PS 101K and so parents are frequently invited to the school watch their child 
perform or achieve various milestones in their academic career. These assemblies include Principal’s Honor Roll, Holiday Show, 
Drama Play, Music Recitals, Circus Arts, Halloween Parade, Student Government Elections, etc. 
 
                  In addition to hosting events, our school makes regular contacts with its parents through its translatable website 
(www.ps101k.com) and through its parent notification system, School Messenger. School Messenger is capable of sending out 
messages to parents about school closing, events, emergencies, etc. It is also equipped to provide instant translation of these 
messages in over 30 languages.  Furthermore, teachers are required to either sign up for Remind101 or Class Dojo.  This is 
another platform that enable teachers to sends texts and reminders to parents on the class level.  They can be individualized to 
the child or sent as a mass text to the entire class. We have received a lot of positive feedback for both from parents. Again, 
this is because technology allows us unprecedented communication levels with non-English speaking parent

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Gregg Korrol, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

PS 101K tracks its student population via generated reports on ATS, including the RPOB and RLER reports, as well 
as the RCPL and RHLA which identify the home language of each student in the school and their total percentages 
in the school. The students home language for ATS is surveyed during the intake process after giving the parent 
the HLIS to complete and an informal interview. Since of over 80% our parent population speaks a language other 
than English at home, providing parents with appropriate and timely information in a language they can 
understand is a priority for our school. To verify the exact language and dialect of preferred contact, a survey is 
distributed at the beginning of every school year. It is distributed and recollected from parents within 30 days of 
the first day of the school year, or within 30 days of student enrollment. Any changes are noted immediately in 
ATS. Additionally, blue cards have a place for parents to record their preferred language of written and oral 
communication. Copies of both the survey and blue card of every child are kept securely in the classroom, in the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

main office and by the nurse. Every teacher, administrator and related service providers has access to this 
information when necessary.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

How does your 
school plan to 

provide 

interpretation 

service(s)?  

Chinese parents 
will have access 
to in-house 
translators (paras 
and staff), as well 
as volunteers 
from a local after 
school 
organization. As 
for Spanish, 
Arabic, Russian, 
Tajik, Uzbek, and 
Urdu, there is a 
staff member on 
hand that can 
speak each of 
these languages. 
Most are 
paraprofessionals, 
and will be hired 
to help out in this 
capacity since a 
portion happens 
after regular 
school hours.

Throughout the year 

 

 

 

We utilize over-
the-phone 
interpretation 
when needed, or 
if the child has a 
bilingual para, 
she/he will 
provide the 
translation to the 
parent. 

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

A school-wide emergency message is sent out via School Messenger, which is capable of translating all messages into 
50 different languages. For rarer languages, such as Uzbek, we will utilize the translation services provided by the LTI 
Unit. Our bilingual staff members will also reach out to parents using a parent contact list. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

At the beginning of the school year during teacher orientations, numerous protocols are discussed. This includes a 
discussion and memo regarding the Translation and Interpretation Services available to staff members. Since we have 
such a high rate of non-English speaking parents, every teacher is equipped with LTI Unit’s phone number so that they 
can obtain high quality translations for their parents of the happenings in school. Teachers are also instructed on the 
parameters required of translators so that no minor will be provided inappropriate access to information that is 
sensitive to an individual’s child. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The welcome poster is posted at the front door of our school building by the school security guard. The Parent guide is 
distributed to parents on the first day of school. The security officer and our parent coordinator has the Language ID 
Guide to refer to and help parents communicate with school staff. Other language identity cards are kept in the office 
in case neither the LAC nor Parent Coordinator are available. We also use email and websites to help reach our 
parents via translation services (i.e. Babel Fish or Google Translate). Our main school’s website is powered by Word

Press, which has integrated Google Translate seamlessly into its platform. This means it’s very easy for parents to 
translate the frequent updates on their own into their own language. School Messenger also pushes out 
announcements to parent phones in 50 languages.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

An in-house parent feedback survey will be distributed in September to all parents. This survey asks parents how they 
would like to receive information, how they can contribute to the school and what services they would like to see. We 
also review the city-distributed survey for feedback on the quality of our school communication, service and 
environment at the end of the year. Parents prefer to bring their own friends or family for translation services, but are 
appreciate the availability of the translators we have on staff. Many know this bilingual staff members by name and 
ask for them at the start of any face-to-face interaction or over-the-phone meetings.
