Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

IN-Tech Academy’s Mission Statement: We are committed to becoming self-reliant learners who are prepared 
through technology and academic rigor to be productive and responsible citizens of our community. 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
IN-Tech Academy (Information and Network Technology Academy) is a federal magnet school with a theme of applied 
global technology. We are located near Marble Hill, on the border of Kingsbridge and Riverdale in the Bronx. We 
strive to use technology in all content areas in order to engage students but also to better prepare them for the 
future. Students take technology classes in Mac and PC labs beginning in grade 6. High school students have a choice 
to participate in advanced technology courses that lead to certifications in computer networking (CISCO) and business 
applications (Microsoft Office, Entrepreneurship and Virtual Enterprises). They may also take classes such as Web 
Design, Computer Graphics and Yearbook Design. Middle and high school students have the opportunity to join our 
MOUSE Squad program through which they serve as technicians troubleshooting network and hardware problems. In 
the spring we hold our annual STEM Fair during Family Technology Night. Students and parents participate in 
technology workshops that include topics such as digital photography, cyber safety and online résumés. 

The IN-Tech community believes that educating the whole person means that academic knowledge is linked to social-
emotional learning. Our school culture addresses the needs of the whole student and we rely on all members of our 
community to help us. Teachers work closely to address student needs and have an ongoing dialogue with parents 
and guidance counselors. Through the use of IO Classroom and the school Web site, stakeholders in the community 
communicate about student performance, concerns, events, and anything else necessary for us to achieve our goals. 

College and career readiness and awareness is a priority in all aspects of our school culture. We follow a strict 
Response to Intervention (RTI) and referral process while promoting inclusive classrooms that address the needs of all 
learners. We have created a supportive and nurturing community that embraces the philosophy of respect for all. 
Through our Angels and positive intervention programs, we foster a safe environment where all are accepted and 
supported. 

Partnerships 

We are fortunate to have partnerships with Manhattan College, Riverdale Neighborhood House (RNH) and Young 
Women’s Leadership Network supporting the needs of our students. In addition to holding assemblies for our female 
population focusing on the engineering field, Manhattan College provides us with tutors, student teachers and 
counselors. RNH runs the School’s Out New York City (SONYC) after-school program at IN-Tech Academy; our middle 
school students participate in STEM activities, the arts, sports and leadership development through this program. 

College Bound Initiative (CBI) through Young Women's Leadership Network is another of our partners. CBI empowers 
our young women and men to realize their higher education and life potential. CBI places a full-time college guidance 
advisor in our building who works with our community to maximize students’ college awareness, access, and financial 
aid awards. In collaboration with school counselors, CBI hosts two college fairs, several college tours and visits, career

students early exposure to the college process. 

The Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI) is yet another partnership that promotes college and career readiness. 
This partnership is the product of the New York City Council Middle School Task Force’s ongoing collaboration with 
the DOE. We use a multi-tier, interdisciplinary approach to literacy instruction that focuses on language acquisition 
and academic vocabulary, debate, and the explicit teaching of reading comprehension strategies throughout the core 
subjects. 

Finally, IN-Tech is supported by funds from the Heckscher Foundation and runs a summer bridge program funded by 
the Hayden Foundation. The Heckscher Foundation funds coaches to work with teacher leaders and administrators to 
help IN-Tech with its drive to college and career readiness. The bridge program focuses on incoming freshmen and 
helps build their math and literacy skills; this program also provides an enrichment component and helps students 
transition to high school. In addition, students and parents attend town hall meetings during the first week of school 
at which they are introduced to staff members, learn about school-wide expectations and learn about Positive 
Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) programs. As a result, our school has a high attendance rate, low rate of 
suspensions, and a good safety record. 

Teacher Teams 

IN-Tech has 75 teachers and our retention rate is 87%. On average, our teachers have been teaching 9.5 years. It is 
expected that our teachers infuse technology into all areas of their pedagogy, and they are generally tech-savvy. They 
use technology to prepare and present lessons, analyze student progress, and communicate with students and 
parents. They use data tools such as IO Classroom and curriculum tools such as Castle Learning and Geogebra. These 
enable teachers to prepare lesson materials on various reading levels, providing multiple entry points. They strive to 
maximize student engagement and professional development is ongoing and flexible to meet instructional needs. 

IN-Tech Academy has participated in the NYC Campaign for Middle School Success Program. As part of this program 
we redesigned our teacher teams (previously known as Professional Learning Communities or PLCs) and worked with 
education consultants to develop norms for meetings in order to make the most of this collaborative environment. 
This shift proved to be effective in enhancing teacher collaboration in middle and high school. 

At teacher team meetings, teachers work together to analyze data and reports, a process that informs instruction. 
Based on this analysis, goals are set and teachers reflect on their practice by identifying target groups; ultimately this 
improves student performance and teacher instruction. This process of frequent teacher meeting fosters 
collaboration within and between departments that directly and positively affects student engagement. 

Demographic and Other Information 

IN-Tech is a 6-12 school currently serving approximately 1,000 students. Our demographics are 82% Hispanic, 11% 
Black, 3% Asian, 3% White, and 1% Other. The attendance rate is 93%, and 81% of our students qualify for free lunch.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Special Student Population and Specific Needs 

ELLs make up approximately 20% of our students, and students with disabilities make up close to 30% of our 
population. Needs vary from language acquisition to numeracy and literacy.

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Focus 

Our current instructional focus is to increase student engagement, perseverance and achievement for all learners 
through rigorous discussion of content material that results in improved written responses in multiple modes. This is 
done by providing multiple entry points into all lessons, providing appropriate challenges, and improving feedback, 
grading and assessment policies. Through these practices, teachers ensure rigorous instruction and support. 
Collaborative teacher teams are a critical school improvement priority; in these teams, teachers work to develop 
methods for increasing student engagement and other strategies for improving student achievement. Teams are 
organized by grade level as well as department to take advantage of the vertical model. Teacher team leaders meet 
regularly and focus on key issues. Team meetings are built into teachers’ schedules and the bell schedule was 
modified to provide teams with more meeting time each week. Administrators attend the meetings to share best 
practices and conference with teachers on how best to weave them into their pedagogy. These discussions are also 
part of the work for the school-wide faculty conferences. During team meetings, teachers are involved in inquiry. This 
allows us to use a more critical lens as we look at student work, set goals, tailor instruction, and monitor the effects of 
teaching strategies and decisions aimed at addressing specific student needs. Teachers use this forum for sharing best 
practices, resources and data. After participating in professional development which has included the Association for 
Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD) conferences, Urban Advantage, and our current participation in the 
Learning Partners Program (LPP), teachers turnkey their learning to their peers. 

In the last school year, the most progress was made in the area of math instruction and curriculum development. 
Through the efforts of the team led by an outside consultant, math instruction has become more rigorous, more 
cohesive and deeper. Teachers shared responsibilities in several subjects, including crossing over from middle to high 
school and back. This has resulted in higher scores on our math exams as well as an increased enthusiasm among the 
staff. This work will continue in 2018-2019, as will our work on curriculum and instruction in all other departments. 

We will continue to push the use of data tracking systems to monitor teachers’ practice and student achievement. 
This work includes not only mock Regents exams to gather information, but also monitoring the impact of project-
based learning. 

Finally, we continue to build strong family-community ties as we involve the SLT and PTA in our decisions around 
calendar changes, the bell schedule, event requirements, and many other initiatives. We use various resources to 
maintain our shared vision for students as members of the global community.

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 60% of students will participate in activities sponsored by after-school program coordinators, student 
government, or community service projects for middle and high school. This will allow students to develop leadership 
skills that foster a safe and nurturing classroom environment that can build trust between teachers and students and 
will reduce incidents by 15% as evidenced when comparing OORS reports from 2017-2018 to 2018-2019.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
Beginning with the “Back to School” fair in September, parents will be encouraged to become more active participants 
in the school’s events. In addition, we will run workshops for staff and parents that focus on effective ways to 
communicate with young adults. 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
 

The student portion of the NYC survey will help guide us with respect to improved communication. We will also 
monitor this through a Google survey midyear. 

In order to achieve the goal of 60% of our students engaging in extracurricular activities, we involve faculty advisors, 
coaches and supervising teachers. We provide necessary materials such as art supplies and equipment so that 
students and advisors can accomplish the goals of the activity. We accommodate schedule adjustments such as time 
before or after the regular school day. The schedule for town hall meetings will vary so that students do not lose 
instructional time. If necessary, instructional resources will be purchased to supplement the student government and 
events. During Parent-Teacher Conferences, Parent-Teacher Meet and Greet, teacher-parent engagement time, 
Technology Night and Portfolio Showcase Afternoon, our schedule will be adjusted to reflect time for the 
collaboration of parents, teachers, and students. Announcements for opportunities will be made through various 
media such as the Web site and IN-Tech News Network.

Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
In order to achieve this goal, we will need to leverage teacher team leaders and teams, parent coordinator, guidance 
counselors and deans. The instructional resource is the PupilPath software as well as professional development for 
teachers and workshops for parents run by school staff. The framework and outreach can also happen during teacher 
team meetings and parent/teacher conferences. We will need to consider the timing for the rollout as the 
parent/teacher association only meets once a month and we want as many parents signed on as early as possible. We 
will also consider alternate methods of communication such as a school app.

teacher team leaders were engaged in articulating the school’s instructional focus on grading and assessment. 
Teachers will work with outside vendors and field support personnel regarding using assessments to improve 
instruction. Teachers will also turnkey professional development experiences at the Monday sessions now built into 
the schedule. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the

participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. IN-Tech Academy (MS/HS 368), in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

IN-Tech Academy (MS/HS 368) will support parents and families of Title I students by doing the following. 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

Through Parent-Teacher Association meetings we will 

  provide materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement levels, 
e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; PTA meetings are held monthly and include invited guests such as 
cyber safety specialists and local police officers; teachers present important aspects of their curricula to 
parents to make them aware of possible areas needing support; a translator is available at all meetings; 

  provide parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

decision making in support of the education of their sons and daughters; parents, administrators and teachers 
are invited to attend District 10 informational meetings regarding School Leadership Teams; 
foster a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can support and monitor a 
student's progress through PupilPath and the weekly parent outreach; 



  provide assistance to parents in understanding city, state and federal standards and assessments; 
 

share information via e-mail, calls and flyers about school and parent-related programs, meetings and other 
activities in a format and in languages that parents can understand; 

  provide professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 

outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community. 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based on a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English language learners and students with disabilities. The school 
community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy with 
Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school surveys 
and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and enhance the 
school’s Title I program. The school will maintain this information. 

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. 

 

To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school in cooperation with the SLT and other 
parent participants will do the following: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families; the Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of students who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents; the Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events 
and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations, literacy, accessing community and 
support services, and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home; 

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., NCLB/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 of each school year to advise 

parents of students participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right

to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118, 
and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; 
conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their child’s academic needs and what parents can do to help.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Direct Instruction - Our supplemental program is designed to close the achievement gap; based 
on our data from the NYS 2017 exams 2.5 % of our ENL students in ELA are on grade level, and 
3 % of our ENL students are on grade level in math. This data is in comparison to non ENL 
students with 31.2% on grade level in ELA and 14.7% in math. All subgroups of ELLs  in grades 
6-8 are invited to participate. Our high school ELLs will receive support in content areas to 
prepare them for Regents testing and to support credit accumulation.  
The program will begin October 1, 2018,  and end approximately on May 1, 2019. Our ELL 
teachers will provide direct instruction through flexible groupings with a ratio from 15:1 - 25:1 . 
The classroom teacher will be responsible for maintaining student records and parent interaction. 
Follow up records will be kept by the school aide. The aide will work with the teachers to 
contact parents. Home language preference will be supported by the parent coordinator.  The 
Title III direct instruction supplemental  program will be held before,after school, and on 
Saturdays,  depending on the individual student's schedule. The middle school program will meet 
every Tuesday and Thursday from 2:45 PM - 4:15 PM. The high school program will meet every 
Wednesday and Thursday from 8:00 AM - 8:45 AM or 3:45 PM - 5:15 PM. 
All ELL students will be invited to participate with a focus on the entering and emerging ELLs, 
who have the biggest academic gap in comparison to their mainstream peers. The program will 
focus on building academic language, building foundational skills, and providing students with 
strategies that will support them in their content area classes. In the hour and a half, students will 
receive academic support in reading, writing, listening and speaking skills. Students will read 
text, respond to writing prompts, engage in listening activities and have time to practice their oral 
skills. The student’s level of English proficiency will determine the type of instruction received. 
SIFE, entering, and emerging students will participate in the Wilson or Just Words program 
provided by a certified ENL Wilson teacher. The Wilson materials will be at no cost this year 
since we already have those materials in the building. Students who complete the first level of 
Wilson Reading Systems will move on to Wilson Just Words. This program will be of cost to the 
Title III program since we have not purchased those materials. Transitional and extended 
students will use resources such as Lightsail reading online program, that will be used on the 
iPads purchased this year. The Lightsail program will be at cost for the school. In addition, we 
will use Title III funding to purchase additional materials and resources to support ELLs. As a 
technology school we would like to purchase electronic translators, thereby providing students 
with digital technology and support services. This year we purchased Spanish/English, 
Arabic/English, Chinese/English and Albanian/English glossaries.  Since our Arabic population 
continues to grow we will purchase additional Arabic bilingual glossaries. These students will be 
able to take home these resources to receive support at home. For the 2018-2019 school year, we 
will purchase additional glossaries and new Urdu/English ones. This will be at cost to the school.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
 
Other materials we will purchase include the ENL supplemental materials, classroom supplies 
and other resources helpful for their learning that can be used both in the classroom during the 
day and during the supplemental Title III program. 
 
Students will also participate in field trips to supplement the learning in the content area 
classrooms and to provide background knowledge on content area topics. One example is the trip 
to Phillipsburg Manor located in Westchester. This will be at cost to the school since we have to 
charter a bus. The students will be provided with hands-on experience of colonial life at the two 
sites they visit in the Historic Hudson Valley. This experience correlates with their social studies 
units. 
We will also provide field trips to align with other units, such as the immigration experience to 
Ellis Island, the Science Museum, and the Museum of Natural History. The Madame Tussuad 
experience will be a culminating project of their biography, women’s history, and non-fiction 
units. These trips will be at cost to the school for the coverage of entrance fees.

Begin description here:            
 
Rationale: 
The school's professional development program will be implemented to support the ENL 
instructional program and professional needs of the teachers. Our ENL teachers work with our 
content area teachers to develop units and to modify existing units to support the varying levels 
of English proficiency. This professional development is ongoing as it occurs bi-monthly during 
our weekly PD time. The in-house PD is at no cost to the school. All teachers working in the 
Title III program will receive ongoing PD. These teachers have weekly time built in to their 
programs. The PD will be aligned with the district's ELL professional development that our ELL 
liaisons attend on a monthly basis. We will also provide professional development on the book 
The ESL/ELL Teacher's Survival Guide by Larry Ferlazzo and Katie Hull Sypnieski. 
In addition, we have scheduled a cost to the school so that they can meet as a group during non-
school hours based on per session rates. 
Facilitators: Our two lead ENL teachers will facilitate (Ms. Clemente and Mr. Powell).      
This will be a monthly series that will take place the last Wednesday of every month beginning 
in October 2018 and ending in May 2019. The schedule is as follows: 
 
 October 3, 2018

The ENL teachers will meet to read and discuss the material in the professional development 
book. The strategies will then be implemented in the class and data will be collected for the 
effectiveness of the strategies. 
 
The topics of ENL PD will vary based on need. Currently we are focused on increasing math 
scores in the ENL subpopulation. Other topics for PD include academic vocabulary, Project 
Based Learning, and Reciprocal Teaching. 
In addition to these trainings, our teachers participate in the school's Professional Learning 
Communities where they are involved in inquiry work that includes professional development in 
areas of need, work on curriculum mapping, and lesson plan development in collaborative teams. 
This is at no cost to the school since it occurs during built-in common prep 
time,Attendance sheets and agendas will be kept in the ELL coordinator's office and with the 
payroll secretary's file. 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact 
higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as 
parent orientation during ELL identification process.

Begin description here:            
 
 
Rationale:We design parent workshops based on the needs of our students and community. We 
conduct parent workshops to engage parents in the academic support of their children. In 
September/October we provide parents with workshops designed to understand their child's 
curriculum and academic path at IN-Tech Academy. The workshops are provided during school 
time and we have workshops during non-school hours for our working parents. The workshops 
during the non-school hours will be at cost to the school. 
 
We have continuous workshops designed to inform parents about the ENL programs and the 
choices they have for their children. In addition, we conduct workshops so that parents stay 
abreast of the many required components of their child's academic career, such as choosing the 
right high school, test-taking strategies and academic support in the home. The non-school 
hours workshops are at cost to the school. 
 
Our parents also participate in celebratory events such as award ceremonies and family 
technology night. We intend to continue providing resources for our families, such as books for 
parents in English and in their native language. These materials will be at cost to the school. The 
costs are approximately $250.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
 
Oral and written interpretation services are provided through Legal Interpreting Service (LIS). 
Topics have included how to use PupilPath, graduation requirements, Regents and SAT test prep. 
Parents are notified via school messenger, Pupil Path email, flyers or letters that are mailed home 
and backpacked with students in English and the native language.   
We provide English as a New Language classes, technology classes, yoga classes and jewelry 
making classes  to all parents and community members. 
Our tentative schedule is as follows:    
    We are in the process of finding the providers to service the Title III parents 
     Parent classes are scheduled to begin January 9 - February 6, 2019 -  4 week program - total 
of 32 hrs (approximately $1760.00) 
     Computer/Technology Classes: Monday and Wednesday from 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM  
                Cost to the school: Per session for technology teacher

All parents are invited to attend the workshops through PTA meetings, school messenger, 
PupilPath and backpacked letters. The school website displays these dates and information. The 
workshops are conducted with bilingual staff to support the parents' language. The parent 
coordinator maintains records, agendas, and attendance sheets for these events and meetings.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school is currently in its fourth year of the Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI) and through this grant we administer 
the Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) assessment as a baseline, midline, and endline. The data on the ELLs shows that the 
average score for 6th grade is a 41 which translates to a fourth grade reading level. In 7th grade the ELLs are averaging a score 
of 39 which is a grade level of 3.9; in the 8th grade the ELLs are averaging a score of 51 which translates to a fifth grade reading 
level. We have used this data to create Response to Intervention Tier II groups. The students have been grouped by DRP levels 
and receive small group instruction five times a week. In addition, we have targeted these ELLs to receive additional support 
through our ELL Academic Success Saturday Academy. In high school, our students completed baselines in all content areas. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           60 

 

 

The data shows a significant gap between our ELLs and the general education students. We have programmed our high school 
students to receive integrated services in content areas and we have designed the program to also have a stand-alone ENL 
class as needed. Our teachers also use teacher-created assessments that provide them with the information needed to 
differentiate day-to-day instruction for our ELLs. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Common planning time to create assessments and review data. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Our data specialist works closely with the ELL supervisor and the administration team to analyze data and determine next 
steps for our ELLs. We monitor student progress throughout the year and make changes to the program and/or curriculum as 
needed. To determine success we measure growth from the baselines to the endlines; we also use state assessments 
and progress reports.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Gap analysis leading to changed groupings in tier classes and general programming. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
In regards to the data patterns, we have noticed that our students perform better in the upper grades. This is evident with the 
number of ELLs in middle school versus the number of ELLs in high school. We also notice that most of our ELLs are from 
Spanish speaking countries and the ELLs that perform well on the Spanish LAB tend to perform better on the NYSITELL as 
well.  We have about the same number of ELLs with 0-6 years of schooling as we do in the long term category.  In reference to 
new levels of English proficiency, most of our ELLs are either entering or extending. These trends have been the same for a 
number of years since we get many new students in middle school and our current students advance to higher levels of English 
proficiency. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Team meetings and Google spreadsheets. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

We have a freestanding ENL program with integrated and stand-alone services. In middle school we have four 
certified ESL teachers that provide stand-alone services five times a week. These students are grouped by English 
proficiency. In addition, the students receive five periods of integrated services in content area classrooms. Our 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61 

 

 

transitional students receive services in the integrated setting as well. In high school most of our students receive 
integrated services provided by two certified ESL teachers. In addition, we have a dual licensed English / ENL teacher 
and a bilingual special education teacher that helps support the required amount of minutes for our ELLs. The few 
students that are required to receive stand-alone services are pulled out by a certified teacher. In addition, we added 
a first period for high school students whose programs were not flexible for stand-alone minutes. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

In the fall of 2017 we are opening one grade 6 bilingual class with a certified teacher. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A   

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

We follow the guidelines from charts 5.1 and 5.2.  Students are programmed based on their English Proficiency level in a 
standalone and/or integrated content class. The tier programming in middle school and the number of licensed teachers in 
high school allows us to ensure the required amount of mandated minutes. We continue to monitor all student programs and 
be flexible in programming to ensure accuracy. Since we have a freestanding ENL program, 100% of our instruction is in 
English. However, we do provide HLA instruction as needed for our newcomers, entering, and emerging students. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Our curriculum is modified and differentiated by our ELL teachers who work in collaboration with the content teachers to 
meet their demands on the CCLS. Our teachers are programmed to have common planning time and weekly professional 
development is conducted in the teacher team meetings.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Students are provided the native language support as needed based on oral, written translation and translated material.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Tiered instruction is provided through differentiated instruction, material and lesson planning.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
We use all mainstream materials; however, the teachers are provided with professional development to scaffold and 
differentiate content for the ELLs-SWDs.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We follow all IEP mandates. We are unique because we are a 6-12 school and our goal for our our most restrictive students is 
to move to a less restrictive environment. Therefore, when we program, we think about what program will best meet their 
needs. Currently, in middle school we have self-contained, ICT and SETSS services. We have parallel programming in middle 
school so that students have the flexibility to move in and out of self-contained to ICT as needed. In high school, we currently 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62 

 

have all our students programmed in either an ICT class or a SETSS class. However, we carefully assess our students and 
collaborate with the special education and content teachers to make program determinations based on need. ELL teachers 
push-in to classes with SWD to provide additional support when necessary. Our co-teaching models may include a special 
education or related services teachers along with an ENL and content teacher.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ELL students are grouped according to NYSITELL and NYSESLAT levels and receive the required minutes as required in CR- Part 
154.2. Our teachers use Tier 1 interventions for all their students. In middle school targeted intervention for Tier II is given 
through tiered instruction, Wilson, Great Leaps Program and Castle Learning. In the high school, Castle Learning is the primary 
Tier II intervention; however, interventions through student grouping and differentiated lesson planning is also implemented. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are continuing to use the Wilson program and are adding Wilson Just Words for the upcoming school year. We have 
benchmark assessments to evaluate the effectiveness along the way.     
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our ELL students participate in the same programs provided to our general education population. We have academic and 
social supplemental services including but not limited to sports, cheerleading, debate, media, Virtual Enterprises, MOUSE 
Squad, Regents and SAT prep. We also have an ENL  extended day academy for our ELLs.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Native language support in the content areas, ENL editions of core curriculum textbooks, workbooks, and teacher-created 
scaffolded materials using ELL strategies such as QTELL are used. In addition, we have three fully equipped technology labs, 
SMART Boards in almost every classroom and the use of laptops in the classrooms. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is used in classrooms through translated editions of textbooks, lessons and vocabulary, and students 
are provided with bilingual glossaries. If the teacher is bilingual, the HL is used verbally, and if not glossaries and translated 
materials are used. Teachers also pair up students with bilingual students.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

ELL students receive all required services with developmentally appropriate materials. ELL libraries were just upgraded this 
year through Book Source.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).

All new students are invited to join our Summer SONYC program, provided through Riverdale Neighborhood House. Grade 6 
and incoming grade 9 students attended an orientation in June. All other students participate in orientation in August. In 
addition, our ENL incoming grade 9 students are participating in a summer bridge program. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Our school has a comprehensive Spanish Foreign Language curriculum including AP Spanish and Native Spanish classes.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The staff receives ongoing professional development provided by the ENL coordinator. Weekly common planning meetings 
provide opportunities for teachers to plan and share best practices, and most importantly articulate with non-ENL teachers of 
ELLs. The staff is provided with opportunities for in-house professional development as well as through outside vendors 
provided through NYC DOE  and OELL opportunities. In addition to the ENL teachers, all staff members are trained in varied ELL 
workshops given throughout the year during professional development, after school, lunch-and-learns, and prep time. 
  
As a 6-12 school, we have the opportunity to provide continuous professional development to our staff based on the needs of 
our staff members. Our teachers and other staff have ample opportunities during common planning periods, 
departmental  meetings, and PLCs to articulate best practices that support the transition from middle school to high school. 
We also work closely with our Guidance Department to ensure that all students receive the support necessary with the 
transition. 
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
We differentiate the professional development based on the needs of staff and students. Since we are a 6-12 school, 
opportunities for collaboration and articulation are abundant in teacher team meetings that are formally and informally held.  
 
We provide professional development based on CR Part 80. Records of professional development are kept on file. We have 
monthly faculty and departmental meetings. We also have bi-weekly teacher team meetings. In addition teachers are provided 
professional development opportunities through outside vendors.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We work closely with our parent coordinator and the PTA to make sure that ELL parents are well informed and participating in 
the decision making for their children. Our parents participate in the summer orientation program where they are introduced 
to the school’s policies. We have ELL parents represented on the School Leadership Team and they work closely with all 
members on the Comprehensive Educational Plan. Our continued support for our parents includes: 
•     Parent orientations which begin in September 
•     Monthly follow up orientations as new students enroll 
•     Parent-Teacher Conferences – 3 in the Fall /Winter  –  and 3 Winter / Spring  
•     ELL workshops during the Parent-Teacher Conference nights and throughout the school year 
Translation services are available at PTA meetings, SLT meetings, Parent-Teacher Conferences and all workshops. Translation 
services are provided by either an outside agency or through bilingual staff including teachers, secretaries, teacher aides, 
administrators and our parent coordinator.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
The evaluation of the needs of our parents is a process which begins with the analysis of the Learning Environment Survey. The 
parent information is analyzed and used to determine our support services and/or programs for our parents in the upcoming 
school year. The parent coordinator works closely with the PTA and SLT. This is a school-wide decision-making team and the 
parent coordinator and the SLT members represent the voice of all of our parents. The ongoing PTA meetings, as well as the 
School Leadership Team meetings, provide us with an abundance of information regarding the needs of the parents. The 
results of our ongoing parental evaluations are used as the platform for parental involvement activities. The data gathered 
drives our activities, such as the development of ENL classes for our ELL parents. We also are starting computer classes with 
the help a bilingual technology teacher. Our parents have also shown interest in hobbies and this year we have created arts 
and crafts workshops. These classes include jewelry making, craft making from recyclable materials, and fabric painting.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Stephen Seltzer, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We collect data from several sources including student emergency cards, ATS reports and PTA surveys. In 
addition, we gather parent's preferred language on an on-going basis as new students are transferred and or 
registered. We have continuous conversations with our parents during parent-teacher conferences, special events 
or other parent meetings.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of a school emergency our school-based personnel as well as the T&I phone interpretation service is used

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

T&I phone interpretation information is distributed and reviewed during staff meetings. This information is also 
shared via email. Staff is notified that any forms/letters that need to be translated can be sent to the parent 
coordinator for translation. Forms/letters needed in any language other than Spanish are submitted to an approved 
DOE vendor for translation.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)

The Language ID guide will be kept in room 155 and the main office. Language ID poster and pamphlets as well as 
translated signage is posted at the main entrance, the main office and the parent room.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We will monitor services from the parent survey and from our monthly meetings with the parents at the PTA and SLT 
meetings. We also use feedback from P/T conferences. We have used feedback to ensure we have an adequate 
amount of interpreters available. We encourage our personnel to use the phone interpretation service to contact 
families and the Language Access Coordinator encourages school counselors and teachers to set appointments for 
limited-English proficient families to give them adequate time to communicate.
