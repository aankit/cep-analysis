Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The mission statement of PS 50Q is to provide an environment that cultivates all of our students’ strengths by 
nurturing their verbal, mathematical, scientific, artistic, social and kinesthetic abilities. It is our goal to prepare our 
children to become lifelong learners as thoughtful, intelligent, and creative citizens of our community. We will do this 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

by providing our staff with professional development and build teacher capacity in order to enable our students to 
have standards based instructions to prepare them for college and career readiness. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S. 50Q, a school in Jamaica Queens is an elementary school with 817 students from Pre-Kindergarten to grade 5. The 
school population comprises 19% Black, 45% Hispanic, 22% Asian and 2% White. The student body includes 17% 
English Language Learners and 18% students with special needs. 

Our goal at PS 50 is to create a collaborative school community with all stakeholders- staff, parents and students in 
which we prepared students for the demands of the 21 st century and for college and career readiness.  

We use research based pedagogy and programs in order to provide students instruction that will allow them to 
achieve at high levels. We analyze data for trends and patterns and look for gaps in what students know and are able 
to do and the demands of the common core. 

Our Curriculum: 

In order to align the Curricular to the Common Core Learning Standards and including the instructional shifts and to 
promote higher order thinking skills our school has done the following: 

English Language Arts (ELA): 

Our ELA goals 

With the collaboration of a TC staff developer, grade teams as well as vertical teams will focus on the following areas 
in ELA 

  Using data and assessments to set goals  
  Using the tools of the unit to support students with goals  
 

Small group work in reading to support students with goals  

  Conferring in writing to support students with goals  
  K-2 Stamina and Partner reading  
  3-5 Independence and active reading  
  Building Volume in Writing 

In addition we uitlize the following programs Leveled Literacy Intervention, Achieve, Imagine Learning, Reading A-Z, 
Wilson and incorporating the Orton Gillingham approach to address individual needs.  

Writing 

To engage students in literary and writing tasks across disciplines with a focus on information and argument writing. 
Teachers are asking higher order thinking questions and requiring critical thinking by their students. It is no longer just 
about the “right answer” or information that can be lifted from text. Teachers have moved beyond skills based 
teaching. Rubrics and student checklists make the criteria clear to students and enable them to engage in self-
assessment. Teachers can use rubrics to provide students with specific and timely feedback in order to advance their 
learning. Formal and informal observations allow the administrators to observe these practices in action. Additionally, 
the curriculum maps developed with the instructional coaches illustrate this shift in instruction. We will be launching 
Up The Ladder from Teachers College designed for students that have not had the workshop model, ENL and SWD 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

students and or student who are struggling academically in grades 3-6. This approach will provide access to units in 
Narrative, Information and Opinion writing and offer the students the opportunity to repeatedly draft, revise, edit and 
publish to help gain grade level proficiency. The Intense writing practice in a short time frame will benefit our ENL and 
SWD students.  

 

Math: 

For the past two years we have been developing our practice in using minilessons, routines and games to help student 
with the content. We have done this by conducting whole class minilessons or implementing whole class routines. In 
the past we have looked at our units and matched the minilessons, routines and games to the content.  

Now we will:  

  Explore formative and summative assessment and think about how to use these assessments to inform 
instruction. This work will inform both small group and whole class instruction.  The teams will use the 
assessment data to map out a series of lessons and practice, both in school and at home, meant to develop 
specific strategies and ideas.  

  Create a common language for strategies and ideas in mathematics that is consistent between the grades.    
  Help teachers frame their lessons around goals and objectives. We thought about the types of goals (e.g., 

about when there is a specific objective or goal, like during a guided mini lesson, and when there is a broader 
objective for an investigation) and will continue discussing this through our work together  

  Build awareness around the New York State Next Generation Mathematics Standards  

Common Planning: 

Embedded in schedule is Common Planning. Teachers plan as teams to ensure engaging, rigorous and coherent 
curricular within grades. 

 

Teacher Effectiveness 

To Improve teacher effectiveness towards implementing pedagogical practices that incorporates the instructional 
shifts that are necessary to engage students with the Common Core Learning Standards, by providing feedback that is 
timely, scaffolded and targeted through frequent short cycles of observation where precise next steps are generated 
and implemented. The Danielson Framework is integrated into the culture of our school. Administrators have 
collaborated with our Talent Coach to develop a normed understanding of professional practice. As a result of this 
norming process administrators provide opportunities for teachers that promote shared reflection using the 
Danielson rubric, enabling teachers to continuously evaluate and revise their professional practice. School leaders 
engage in frequent short cycles of observations and provide teachers with actionable feedback that result in a shift in 
teaching practice, enhancing students’ learning. After feedback is given to teachers administrators are able to observe 
whether or not next steps have been implemented. Our tracking sheet shows the levels of performance of each 
teacher and allows us to provide differentiated professional development. 

 

Collaboration with Community Organizations: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

Outside organizations are invited to come into P.S. 50 and expose them to different community resources Agencies 
from immigration, Health Plus/AmeriGroup, Queens Guidance Center, Dress for Success Adult Continuing Education 
and many more take part in educating our families. 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Special Populations: 

Our special education team is committed to creating flexible programs that expose students to the least restrictive 
environment as much as possible, maximizing their time in the general education setting. Frequent team meetings 
allow team members to collaborate in creating program options that are specific to student needs, as opposed to 
more traditional full-day placement options. School wide professional development regarding reform, writing of 
quality IEP's and ensuring Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) will be offered ongoing throughout the year.  

English Language Learners (ENLs) are clustered in one or two classes per grade. Former ENLs who need extra language 
support are provided addtional instruction to ensure growth in the English Language. ENLs participate in Extended 
Day classes taught by English as Second Language (ENL) teachers. These students are grouped based on English 
Language proficiency levels and across grades. At-risk ENLs are identified by analysis of the Annual Measurable 
Achievement Objectives (AMAO) reports as well as formal and informal assessments and observations in 
collaboration among classroom teachers, ENL teachers and Response to Intervention/ Pupil Personnel Team (RTI/PPT) 
teams.  

Flexible in school programming is provided to ensure that student’s individual needs are met. Title III money is used 
for an after school program, the utilization of programs such as Imagine Learning, Rosetta Stone, Reading A-Z and 
Achieve 3000.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our greatest accomplishments include: 

Our greatest strengths on our Quality Review Report 2017-18 was a well developed for Quality Indicator 1.1 in 
Curriculum. Teacher leaders and their colleagues reflect, plan, revise, adapt and modify curricula, utilizing a 
comprehensive program for reading, writing, and math, including resources from Teacher’s College Reading and 
Writing Project (TCRWP). For kindergarten through grade 5, GOMath! program, NYC Pathways for Social Studies, 
results in shared cross curricula essentials and rigorous academic tasks. Curriculum maps and unit plans are updated 
and revised on a continuous basis based on reflection on the teaching of lessons and student’s performance and work 
products from classroom lessons. All curricula is aligned to Common Core Learning Standards and strategically 
integrate instructional shifts. Higher order thinking skills are consistently emphasized for all learners across grades 
and content areas. This accomplishment aligns to the Framework for Great Schools, rigorous instruction. Based on the 
School Quality Snapshot, of positive responses in rigorous instruction we went from 75% to 86%, in Collaborative 
Teachers we went from 73% to 89%, in Supportive Environment we went from 70% to 84%, Strong Family-Community 
Ties we went from 88% to 91%, Effective School Leadership went form 72% to 86% and Trust went from81% to 92%.  

 

Key area of Focus for this school year: 

Based on our PPO and Quality Review, classroom observations and analyzing class data we chose to focus on and 
develop 2.2 Align Assessments to curricula for the 2018-2019 school year. We want to ensure assessment is on going

and that the data is driving the instruction. Teacher teams and Vertical teams will meet to analyze data, revise units of 
study, and gather relevant materials to instruct students accordingly.  

 

Instructional Focus for 2018-2019 school year: 

During the 2018-19 School year we will use data and assessment to set goals according to the needs of the students. 
Teachers will conduct small groups in reading to support students with goals and regularly provide a variety of 
feedback including written, verbal and modeling. Teachers will individualize the type of feedback according the need 
of the student and subject area.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In nurturing future leaders, through both traditional and non-traditional administrative programs, the Principal's role 
of shared leadership and transparent thinking was one that became more evident. Therefore, the principal considered 
the needs of all teachers/staff members in taking on an active leadership role in the educational community. In 
reviewing Advance data, Quality Review and Advance, and our own observations we noticed that the element of 
using Assessment in Instruction needs to be further developed. In reviewing the School Survey, only 23% of teachers 
felt that teachers were not given a leadership role. Looking back at the professional development plan from the 
previous year , we noticed that the majority of professional development was given by Coaches, Administrators and 
outside organizations. Only, 49% of teachers were empowered and given a leadership role in leading professional 
development activities. On the 2015-16 Quality Review Report we received a proficient in 4.2 Teacher Teams and 
leadership development. We will continue and enhance our collaboration teams to further use inquiry to promote 
improved student learning.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019 school leaders including teacher leaders will create and implement a time line of professional 
development activities that builds teachers' capacity to analyze data and revise rigorous unit plans that adhere to the 
State Standards as measured by a 4% increase in teachers improving one performance level reflected in Dainelson 
component 3d Assessment in Instruction.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 50 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary 
and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 50 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

 

  providing materials and hands on training to help parents work with their children to improve their 

achievement level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; (All materials are translated into the parents 
preferred language) 

  providing parents with the information and hands on training needed to effectively become involved in 

 

planning and decision making in support of the education of their children 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; (Class messenger, email, NYC accounts, Class Dojo, Phone Messenger) 
  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:   The Supplemental program is to help English Language Learners 
achieve/acquire English proficiency in the New York State English as a Second Language 
Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) and the New York State English Language exam.   
 
PS 50 uses the TCRWP assessment to assess literacy skills.  The data shows that our ELL 
students are performing below grade level.  Looking at the trends of ELL student growth on 
running records over the past two years, our ELL students in grades K, 1 and 2 made an 8.14% 
increase of students performing at level 3 in the 2014-2015 school year.  According to our NYS 
ELA there was a 16% decrease of students performing at grade level from the 2013-2014 
compared to the 2014-2015 school year.  Through professional Development for teachers of ELL 
students, analyzing data with teachers of ELL student PS 50 will target the areas of student needs 
to ensure that ELL’s continue to make growth with the ultimate goal of performing on grade 
level. 
 
 
Last year our AMAO 2 target was 15%.  We have met this target with a 17.20 % of students who 
have met proficiency level, commanding (cm).  In the upper grades our students that are in the 
Entering, Emerging, and Transitoning levels are our newly admitted to the country ELLs.   We 
have noticed that our lower grade new comers obtain command proficiency at a faster rate then 
the older students.  The school leadership team and the administration is looking closely at our 
new comer ELLs in the upper grades.   RTI and small group ELL services are being 
implemented to help these students acclilmate and begin to learn the English Language.  This 
year our target for our AMAO2 is 15.60%.  In order to meet this target we want to continue with 
our current programs that have been effective thus far.  We plan to target our upper grade ELLs 
in an afterschool program.   
 
In reviewing our data our goal is to supplement and provide additional services to English 
Language Learners to improve reading and writing skills. 
This program will target English Language Learners in grades 1-5.  
The after school program will be conducted by 5 highly qualified certified ESL teachers and 1 
content specialty teacher.  The content specialty teacher will be working with ENL teachers and 
ENL students utilizing the team-teaching model as well as flexible grouping during the 
program.  To serve all of our ELL students in grades 1-5, we are planning 2 twelve week 
sessions to differentiate instruction for the various levels of our students.  The first session will 
run 6 weeks, January 7th - February 12th to target our beginner and low level intermediate 
students in grades 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 for a total of 5 groups.  The students will meet for 1.5 hours

will have 12 students.  The second session will run for 6 weeks, February 25th - April 2nd to 
target our higher level intermediate and advanced students in grades 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for a total of 5 
groups.  The students will meet for 1.5 hours twice a week, Wednesday and Thursday from 2:30-
4:00 for a total of 12 sessions. Each group will have 12 students. All students in grades 1-5 will 
be served by an ESL certified teacher for both sessions.  Teachers will maintain attendance 
record for each day of the program.  All attendance will be collected, reviewed and kept in the 
general office.  All parent notification and permission slips will in the parents preferred language 
and kept on file in the general office.  
The major focus will be to improve reading and writing skills and build academic language 
through a comprehension monitoring, assessment and teaching system.   The resources we will 
utilize are Achieve 3000 and  National Geographic by Reach.  Students will be serviced by ELL 
teachers to build academic language and basic skills.  We will use content based articles to build 
content knowledge and navigate through complext texts and writing that adhere to the 
CCLS.  Students will also be exposed to the NYSESLAT format using Continental NY ELLS. 
Materials utilized during the afterschool program will supplement the curriculum used during the 
school day.  
 Placement within a supplemental program will be determined by: 
- NYSESLAT data 
-NYS ELA data 
-Teacher recommendation 
Students will be taught in english and instruction will be aligned with the CCLS and Citywide 
expectations.

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
PS 50 uses the TCRWP assessment to assess literacy skills.  The data shows that our ELL students are performing below grade 
level standards.  Looking at the trends of ELL student growth on running records over the past two years, our ELL students in 
Kindergarten went from being pre-emergent readers to currently having 10% of those students performing on or above grade 
level.  In 1st Grade our students have shown some growth as 23% of our students are on grade level.  In 2nd Grade, we have 
approximately 12% of our students on or above grade level standards.  For our students in the upper grades, utilizing our NYS 
ELA data from the years 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 school years, in Grade 3, our students showed a decrease of Level 1 
students by 56%, and we increased our Level 2 students by 58%.  Our Level 3 students decreased by only 2%, and the number 
of Level 4 students stayed the same.  In Grade 4, our students showed a decrease of Level 1 students by 23%, and we 
increased our Level 2 students by 20%.  Our Level 3 students increased by 2%, and the number of Level 4 students stayed the 
same.  In Grade 5, our students showed a decrease of Level 1 stduents by 20%, and we increased our Level 2 students by 
14%.  Our Level 3 students increased by 6%, and the number of Level 4 students stayed the same.  According to our NYS Math 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

data from the years 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 school years, in Grade 3, our students showed a decrease of Level 1 students by 
34%, and we increased our Level 2 students by 6%.  Our Level 3 students increased by 32% and our Level 4 students decreased 
by 5%.  In Grade 4, our students showed a decrease of Level 1 students by 14%, and an increase of Level 2 students by 
11%.  Our Level 3 students increased by 1% and our Level 4 students increased by 1% as well.  In Grade 5, our students showed 
an increase of 8% of Level 1 students, and a decrease of 6% of Level 2 students.  Our Level 3 students decreased by 2% and the 
Level 4 students remained the same.  In addition, for the past two years our Limited English Proficient students met their AYP 
goals.  Using our data we have noticed that in order to help  our students in Mathematics, our goal was to utilize additional 
curricular materials (Context for Learning) to support our teachers and the students in the gaps within the existing 
mathematics curriculum.  Our choice to utilize these curricular tools was based upon our analysis of school wide data and 
determining areas of gaps within our students achievement by mathematical standards.  In addition, to support our ENL 
students in ELA, we have purchased additional curricular resources (Up the Ladder) to support our partnership with TCRWP 
through modified units of study for our ENL students.  Through professional Development for teachers of ELL students, 
analyzing data with teachers of ELL students, PS 50 will target the areas of student needs to ensure that ELL’s continue to 
make growth with the ultimate goal of performing on grade level. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Currently our Vertical Team as well as our ENL classroom teachers meet on a regular basis to analyze data and determine 
trends vertically.  Using our assessment data, we have worked with our administrators in finding appropriate resources to 
support our ENL students as well as offer Professional Development opportunities for all of our staff members in these new 
curricular materials.  We also encourage trainings and support our teachers to turnkey information within their grade level 
teams and vertical teams to support continued growth. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Program success for ELLS is evaluated based on the number of students who become English proficient and no longer need to 
be ENL serviced, as well as the number of students whose overall NYSESLAT levels have improved. The four modalities are 
examined separately and compared from one year to the next to determine if the ELL student has shown any progress in that 
area. Based on these four modalities, ELL students receive differentiated instruction targeting those areas in which more help 
is needed. This year we remained the same with the same amount of students performing at a proficient or commanding level 
on the NYSESLAT.  In addition, BOY, Mid-Year, and EOY Assessments in both ELA and Mathematics scores are used to show 
growth of students and inform instruction as well as provide targets for instruction and differentiation options for our 
students.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

There are a wide variety of interventions utilized to support our ENL students.  We utilize ENL Push-in/Pull-out model of 
instruction in small groups and one to one, as well differentiated instruction within student classrooms to support our ENL 
students.  In addition, we provided an ENL academy for students in grades 1-5 to support them with English language 
acquisition, phonics skills, as well as academic language supports.  Our ENL students are also given the opportunity to attend 
AIS classes and Saturday school classes for additional support with regards to test taking skills/strategies.  One of our AIS cycles 
this year was data driven, and supporting grouping our students to best support their needs, utilizing BOY and Mid-Year 
assessments scores.  Finally, for our students who are still struggling we utilize RTI strategies to support students and provide 
them with LLI and Mathematics instruction in these targeted groups. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
All ELL students that are below grade level are given Tier I intervention by their classroom teacher. Student work is analyzed 
and specific strategies are implemented to help the students in need.  The classroom teacher will work with the student in a 
small group an additional 3 times a week.  If a student does not make reasonable progress, they are referred for Tier II 
intervention.  The RTI team will administer a series of assessments and then meet as a team to target the area of need and 
implement an appropriate program of Tier II to help the student.  The student will then be served in a small group to address 
the area of concern.  Based on the individual needs of the students we will utilize Wilson, LLI, Fundations, Math IXL, Reading A-

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

Z, Achieve 3000, Imagine Learning and Rosetta Stone.  The students progress will be monitored and discussed periodically to 
ensure success.  If a student does not make reasonable progress in Tier II intervention, the student will then be recommended 
for Tier III intervention, one-on-one intensive support to meet their needs. If a student is still unable to make adequate 
progress the student will be referred for a special education evaluation.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
NYSESLAT data across proficiency levels over the past two years shows that 37% of students increased 1-2 proficiency 
levels,  56% of the students remained at the same proficiency level, and 30% of the students decreased proficiency levels as 
the testing band changed.  We then looked closer at the modalities and the score conversions to see which students were 
close to moving proficiency levels.  Using this data, we were able to form our groupings and focus our ENL academies on 
working with students who had similar needs.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Our goal for the 2017-2018 academic school year will be to create an ENL team to meet regularly to analyze our ENL student 
data and create targeted instructional goals for our students and their diverse needs.  This will allow us to spend more time 
analyzing our student data and create plans to support our students in their language acquisition needs, as well as provide our 
students with strategies to move students across modalities and into proficiency.  In addition, our goal will be to support 
teachers with additional PD opportunities. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction is delivered in the following manner: ENL instruction is delivered in a self contained class on each grade, K-
5 for general education students.  Teachers on K, 1 and 5 hold a common branch license and an ENL license or an ENL 
extension. We have 2 push-in/ pull-out teachers that work with grades 2, 3 and 4.   Teachers differentiate instruction 
across curriculum subjects throughout the day and group students in their classes according to data from ENL periodic 
assessment, LAB-R results, NYSESLAT results, classroom tests, and classroom work.  ENL teacher pushes-in  into the 
classroom where the teacher is not ENL certified to deliver ENL instruction.  Depending on the students proficiency 
level and the Part 154 requirements push-in/pull-out services will be determined based on the students level of 
proficiency.   Special Education students receive ENL services through the pull-out/ push-in model. These students 
are  pulled-out for the appropriate daily allotted times. They are provided with instruction based on their individual 
needs given in ELA, science and or social studies.  Some students are pulled out to a separated location to work in a 
small group,  some students are pulled out of their class setting and are placed in a self contained ENL classroom 
during the ELA or content area period to obtain ENL instruction in the Least Restrictive Environment.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

To ensure that all students receive their mandated units of ENL instruction, a schedule is created for all pull out/push in 
services.  Entering and Emerging students receive two units of ENL, the equivalent of 360 minutes per week. Transitioning and 
Expanding students receive one unit of ENL, the equivalent of 180 minutes per week.  Commanding students will continue to 
receive receive one unit of ENL, the equivalent of 180 minutes per week (for the next two years).  Service is provided in ELA, 
science and social studies.  Students are scheduled for daily ELA instruction for at least 45 minutes per day in ELA. Students in 
the self contained ENL classes receive instruction throughout the day.  Specific ENL approaches are evident in curriculum 
planning and daily lessons to the whole group.  Teachers also, plan differentiated small groups to target specific skills that each 
individual child requires. Students in the self-contained ENL class are scheduled to receive more than the required mandated 
services.        
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In the various content areas the ENL teacher(s) makes use of varied instructional approaches to enrich language 
development.  Manipulatives are used on a regular basis. The use of technology, audiovisual equipment, and hands-on 
learning is stressed. Students do projects and research based on thematic units and content areas, which stress all four 
modalities of the ENL classroom (listening, speaking, reading, and writing). The content areas are taught in the ENL classroom 
with an emphasis placed on grammar, academic language, specialized vocabulary, and comprehension of non fiction texts. ENL 
teachers modify the Teachers College Units of Study and the Go Math curriculum to meet the needs of the ENL students. 
Content area instruction is modified to support the needs of ENL students.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Tests are administered or translated for ELL students in their Native Language to compare the results with tests taken in 
English.  These results help us to form the correct path of instruction.  We can then appropriately schedule and plan instruction 
for students depending on the area of need, language and or content.  In addition, we support students in their ability to write 
in their native language and then focus on working with them to translate their work samples into English.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. SIFE students are informally assessed by the ENL teachers upon returning to the NYC Public School System. The self 
contained ENL teachers  or the push in ENL teacher provide additional help for the SIFE students within the classroom. Based 
on the needs of the child; students are pulled out in small groups to be given additional services.  In addition, we utilize 
bilingual paraprofessionals and teachers to work with these students 1:1 and in flexible groupings to support them in their 
native language.b. Newly admitted ENL students are given daily small group sessions within the classroom to ensure that their 
needs are being met.  Upper grade students are also taught test-taking strategies in preparation for the ELA and Math State 
Exams. For example, they learn about the test format, how to bubble in their answer sheets, what is a multiple choice 
question, etc. Sample exams are also given to familiarize students with the exams and to test for their strengths and 
deficiencies. A heavy focus is placed on listening and speaking skills for newcomers. Newly admitted ENLs are also invited to 
attend Saturday and after school ENL classes. Reading strategies are taught targeting all the necessary skills needed for the ELA 
exam. Each classroom teacher is supplied with ELA practice booklets which focus on common core aligned standards such as: 
making predictions, cause and effect, inferences, main idea, part to whole, etc.c. For those ENL students receiving services 
from 4-6 years, the NYSESLAT scores are closely looked at to determine which areas of weakness each student has in the four 
modalities. Those students then receive differentiated instruction based on their needs through push-in and pull-out 
instruction as well as within the ENL Academy and Test Prep Academies that our school runs for students in Grades 1-5.d. 
Long-term ENL students are given language enrichment to polish their English skills. Also, because of fossilization, target areas 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

are focused on pinpointing deficiencies they still have in certain English skills. Reading comprehension and writing is heavily 
emphasized, and the content areas are greatly stressed. Because many Long-term ENL students have plateaued in the ENL 
classroom, a heavier emphasis is placed on academic language in both written and spoken form. Grammar lessons are fine 
tuned to focus on specific language issues the students may be having. In addition, Long-term ENL students are given the 
opportunity to attend both Saturday and after-school classes for ENL enrichment.e. Former ENLs are also invited to attend 
Saturday and after school sessions for ENL enrichment.  They are also given extended time to complete classroom tasks and 
tests. They will also continue to receive the same services as current ENL students for the next two years.   Former ENLs are 
monitored and discussed to ensure they are progressing.  In addition, students are entitled to RTI instruction if they are below 
grade level.       
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers that instruct ENL-SWDs are continually assessing language and content knowledge.  ENL teachers are familiar with 
the students IEP and use it to help drive instruction.  The ENL teacher and SWD teacher collaborate to ensure student 
success.  We utilize various strategies to help ensure success, this year we will continue to use the Wilson program for 
decoding and word work and Leveled Literacy, a balanced literacy approach that emphasizes reading comprehension, writing 
and word work. Our school is also utilizing IXL, Reading A-Z, Achieve 3000 and Imagine Learning as technology based programs 
to help our ENL students.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELL-SWD students are instructed with various programs that meet their individual need.  Based on their IEP and data from 
baseline assessments we have various small groups of RTI instruction using Common Core Aligned programs such as the 
Teachers College Reading and Writing Program, GoMath,  Leveled Literacy Intervention and Wilson in small groups.  Students 
are also mainstreamed into Self contained ENL classes to gain specific language acquisition skills on the appropriate level.      
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
In order to ensure that ENLs receive help in specific areas, such as ELA, math, and other content areas. Several interventions 
programs are utilized, such as Wilson, Leveled Literacy Intervention and Fundations.  Based on baseline assessments and 
individual needs students are programmed by the RTI team.   Several instructional materials are employed to support the ENL 
students. For those whose proficiency level is Entering and Emerging, picture cards, phonics books, simple readers, technology 
(computers & Ipads), and audio-visual equipment are used. For Transitioning level ENL students, simple chapter books, writing 
and grammar books, take home booklets, and games are used. Expanding and Commanding students use thematic books 
focusing on the content areas, grammar books, games, and books teaching the literacy skills. All materials are equally used in 
all areas regardless of the language proficiency of the ENL students. Translated math books are also given to Spanish ENLs for 
use at home. In addition, bilingual glossaries are available to ELL students, which may also be used during the state wide math 
exam. ELA practice books are supplied to every classroom teacher and are made available to all students. For those grades 
taking the science citywide exam, bilingual glossaries are also available. Hands-on lessons and the use of visuals are also 
employed in the content areas.  Academic vocabulary is stressed at all levels of instruction across the content areas in addition 
to providing our freestanding ENL classrooms with a wide variety of Spanish language books for our beginner readers.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are continuing to use Wilson and Leveled Literacy, both programs have proved to be successful with our ENL 
population.  We are placing in extra supports for our ENL-SWDs, since these are our students experiencing the greatest 
difficulty passing the NYS ELA and Math exams.  A combination of Push-in, Pull out and RTI will be used to help them 
succeed.  Our self-contained ENL classes will continue to modify curriculum and put strategies in place to better meet the 
needs of ENLs.  We also implemented a monthly meeting for ENL teachers, that will allow them the opportunity to plan, 
discuss strategies and turn key Professional Development workshops that they may have attended.  Finally, our school started 
utilizing many software programs such as Achieve 3000, Reading A-Z, Math IXL as well as Imagine Learning which we would like 
to continue with next year as well with our ENL students.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All students in grades 3-5 are invited to our Saturday Test Prep Academy.  All students in grades 3-5 falling below standards are 
invited to our AIS after school.   All ENL students in grades 1-5 are invited to our Title III after school language enrichment 
program.  All students are invited to be apart of extracurricular activities  that occur throughout the year.  All students include 
ENLs, students with disabilities and regular education students.  We have also offered an ENL Academy for our students in 
Grades 3-5 two times a week, and for students in grades K-2 four times a week.  In addition, we have started to focus on 
creating excursions and residencies for our ENL students this past year by providing students with shows in their native 
language, arts residencies for the students and their families as well as trips to Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty, Historic 
Philadelphia and Amish Country.  Our goal is to support our ENL students and their families in their native language as well as 
support them and their families with their acclimation to American life. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All ENLs have access to technology programs such as, Reading A-Z,  a program that allows students to read, hear stories and 
answer stories, Brain Pop, Brain Pop jr., Math IXL, Scholastic News, Book Flix, Level Literacy Intervention, Fundations, Wilson, 
Achieve 3000, Imagine Learning,  and interactive Go Math.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is very important as a foundation on which ELL students can build their new language learning. If the 
ENL or classroom teacher is able to communicate in the ENL students’ language this is encouraged. Classroom instructions are 
translated in the students’ native language, as needed; and ENL students are also paired with another student who speaks the 
same language. They work together as a collaborative team, with the more advanced student helping the less proficient 
student with translation, comprehension, etc. In this way, native language support is stressed in the ENL environment. ENL 
students are allowed the opportunity to express themselves both orally and in written form in their native language. The 
native language and culture of the ENL student are also celebrated during multicultural lessons taught throughout the school 
year as well as through the institution of multi cultural days.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

P.S. 50 ensures that required services and resources support our ENLs’ ages and grade levels. Every effort is made to provide 
every ENL student with the necessary high-interest books and supplies to pique their interest.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our bilingual Spanish guidance counselor,  our bilingual Spanish social worker , our Spanish speaking parent coordinator, 
Bilingual  Bengali school psychologist , help newcomers to acclimate, show them around, check in with them 
periodically.  Depending on the grade and number of students the guidance counselor, school psychologist and social worker 
will hold  group sessions for newcomers that will allow them the opportunity to make friends and adjust to the school 
environment.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

None

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional Development and Support for School StaffAll ELL personnel at P.S. 50 takes part in professional development. The 
ENL teachers attend TC professional development workshops several times a year, then turnkey with other classroom teachers 
on their grade. During articulation conferences, the ENL teachers meet with the classroom teachers to discuss the progress of 
the ENL students and different strategies that may be used to benefit these students. The ENL teachers are also invited to 
attend all in-house professional development conferences. Several ENL teachers even conduct special in house professional 
development workshops for each grade, in order to better familiarize classroom teachers with the strategies needed to assist 
ENL students. The LAP is also discussed, so as to ensure the planning of quality ENL programs throughout the school.  All ENL 
teachers meet monthly to participate in professional development, analyzing of student work, vertical planning and strategies 
for ENLs.  The literacy and math coaches, as well as the ENL specialists and SWD specialists, hold ongoing professional 
development for the staff on common core learning standards, methods, content and testing procedures for ENL students, 
such as testing modifications, data analysis, promotional exemptions, etc.  All teachers are involved in professional 
development and planning for ELL and SWD students.  All workshops done for General Education has a modified component 
for ENLs and SWDs.  Specific workshops are also scheduled just for specific topics pertinent to ENL students and SWD 
students.  Network specialists will come and hold professional development as well as outside workshops by Teachers 
College.  All professional development activities are kept on file in a binder with attendance sheets and agendas.  Professional 
Development is offered throughout the year  to all ENL teachers for each grade on the common core learning standards, 
strategies to support ENL students and Analyzing student data in all content areas.  ENL teachers attend several ENL 
workshops at Teachers College.  Teachers College staff developers attend our school to support our ENL teachers in creating 
common core aligned curriculum for our ENL students.  Teachers also attend workshops given by the NYC DOE Division of ELL 
and student Student Support. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The guidance counselor attends all workshops offered to help our students transition to middle school.  The guidance 
counselor then holds sessions to inform our graduating ENLs about the different programs available to them in middle 
school.   The guidance counselor also holds parent workshops to facilitate the process of selecting a middle school for ELL 
students.  ENL teachers attend training workshops given by borough specialists, Teachers College, staff developers as well as 
workshops given at the school.  ENL teachers provide workshop for general education teachers to provide support to enhance 
language acquisition and development of ENL students.  All professional development agendas include an attendance sheet 
that are collected and kept on file in the general office.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
ENL teachers as well as classroom teachers utilize the parent engagement time provided on Tuesday during the extended time 
to meet with parents of ENL students.  Group sessions will be provided to provide information on the ENL programs being 
offered,  ENL curriculum, ENL strategies, and how parents can assist and help their child at home.  Individual meetings will 
occur throughout the year to discuss individual student progress, including language development, proficiency in all content 
areas.   Our bilingual parent coordinator conducts regular workshops for parents of ENLs, focusing on math strategies, help 
with homework,  etc.  All meeting will be conducted or translated in the parents home language.     

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parental involvement is encouraged in all school activities, and the school staff makes an effort to include all the parents of 
ENLs. Our bilingual parent coordinator conducts regular workshops for parents of ENLs, focusing on math strategies, help with 
homework, help with immigration, etc. Parents are offered strategies they can use to increase their child’s English abilities 
away from school. The parent coordinator also invites speakers to conduct parent workshops throughout the school year, and 
is actively involved in improving communication with parents and families of ENLs. Several of the workshops are geared 
towards curriculum help in reading, math and the content areas. The school staff meets with parents on a regular basis, and 
several school staff members are able to serve as translators for foreign born parents and students. Our PTA also plays an 
integral part in welcoming and embracing the parents of ENLs. They hold several activities throughout the school year, 
celebrating the cultural diversity of our school population. During Spanish Heritage month, parents are invited to visit the 
classrooms and speak about their cultures. Ethnic foods are prepared and artists are invited to perform. Special workshops 
regarding the NYSESLAT test are held for parents to learn and assist their child in preparation for this exam.All letters that are 
sent out are translated into parents home language, we currently have staff members that we pay per session to translate for 
us.  At parent teacher conferences we utilize in house personnel to translate as well as hire the DOE contracted translator 
service.  For monthly meetings we utilize in house personnel to translated or conduct workshops.  Using ATS reports we found 
that letters need to be translated in Bengali and Spanish.

members who 
can speak the 
languages of 
the families 
who request to 
communicate 
with teachers 
and staff 
members. 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the situation of a school emergency, our school has many staff members who are bilingual and can call to

languages to communicate with our families. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

We will be creating a memo to educate all of our staff members of the primary goals of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 
and the various resources that we can utilize to support our families in their diverse languages. Our goal is to create a 
training to support our staff members across the board of the Chancellor's Regulation.
