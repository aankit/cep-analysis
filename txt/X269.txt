Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and informed by New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Implement at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify 

the instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content 
standards; provide time for collaboration on the use of) beginning no later than the 2018-19 school year. 

  Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 8: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 
Our learning community was founded on the premise that every student is capable of attaining success either in 
college, the workplace, or both. Every BSSWA stakeholder recognizes the crucial importance of providing our young 
Scholar-Activists leadership opportunities , scaffolds, and supports in and outside the classroom and, equally 
important, thoroughly exposing them to a mental model that celebrates college readiness, student voice, and 
leadership. 

 

 
2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, including 

a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented. 

Bronx Studio School for Writers and Artists (BSSWA) is a six through twelve school with approximately 650 students. 
Scholar-Activism at BSSWA rests on five core values. Our commitment, first and foremost, to: (1) achieve academic 
excellence , (2) extend a helping hand to those in need, (3) maintain a peacekeeping culture, (4) summon the courage 
to express our creativity (“think differently!”), and (5) demonstrate pride in our school work as well as the 
accomplishments and gains of others ( school spirit ). Advisory serves as the primary community-wide vehicle for 
transmitting those values and expectations. 

The overarching practical function of Advisory is to strengthen our faculty & staff’s capacity to establish authentic and 
meaningful relationships with students, caregivers, and fellow Advisors across grades and disciplines. Our 6-12 
Advisory system ensures every student is known well by at least one adult, every parent/caregiver has an adult 
contact or point person at the school, and students play an active leadership role in constructing and maintaining a 
highly pro motive, physically and emotionally safe, college bound culture for all. 

Equally important, Advisory is designed to (a) cultivate college & career awareness and socio-emotional maturity, (b) 
introduce our young scholars to coping and conflict resolution skills , (c) immerse our young scholars in highly 
formative service learning experiences , (d) establish the importance of academic and personal goal setting and 
monitoring , (e) impart essential time management & organization skills, and (f) challenge every student to assume 
authentic leadership roles throughout their respective communities. More specifically, Advisors meet with their 
Advisees regularly to review their academic program and ongoing progress, attendance, revisit their academic and 
personal goals, and celebrate improvements and successes. 

HS seniors, juniors, and select sophomores may also select to enroll in AP Environmental Science, AP US History, AP 
Literature, AP Language, AP Statistics and AP Studio Art. 

Additionally, our young scholars may elect to register for College Now courses on the campus of Hostos Community 
College (HCC). 

Our full-time college counselor and her two interns meet with MS & HS students at the college office, in collaboration 
with College Access for All, and coordinate and lead a host college immersion activities year round including Senior 
Parent Night: Dispelling the Myths Related to the College Application & Financial Aid Process, campus trips to various 
colleges, BSSWA HS Alumni Day, and visits from CUNY and SUNY representatives just to name a few. 

We also make it a school-wide priority to increase the number of opportunities for authentic student engagement, 
student voice, and leadership before, during, and after school. 

  Our MS and HS student government and peer mediation program have provided high school students 

opportunities to mentor and re-direct their middle school counterparts on campus and organize school-wide 
community-building events including student elections, dances, fundraisers, and karaoke nights. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

  Our Physical Education department draws a wide-range of students across the MS and HS and enriches the 

community with an assortment of engaging course offerings and PSAL varsity and junior varsity teams 
including boys & girls' rugby, boys and girls' wrestling, girls’ volleyball and boys and girls' basketball.  

Our team of community-based, non-profit partners has also dramatically enhanced the quality of credit-bearing 
electives and after school extra-curricular leadership activities. 

  The Center for Supportive Schools (CSS) Peer Group Connection (PGC) program prepares our young scholars in 

the eleventh and twelfth grades to co-lead ninth grade Advisories and ease their transition to high school. 

  Elevate NY offers two sections of its comprehensive youth leadership course throughout the school day to our 

high school students. 

  Our founding partner, Casita Maria, offers art-based after school programming and tutoring. Casita also 

completely subsidizes a Princeton Review SAT prep course and sponsors multiple college trips exclusively for 
BSSWA juniors and seniors 

  Global Kids, Inc. (GK) serves as our community school grant partner. 

Our MS and HS faculty and staff partner with our team of community-based, non-profit partners to offer academic, 
socio-emotional, and professional development scaffolds and supports for students and faculty: 

  Targeted MS students were programmed to receive differentiated support during Academic Clinic: our after 

school site for academic support and remediation. 

  This year we made additional expenditures on technology in the form of laptops to support classroom 

differentiation and obtained licensing agreements with Aventa to support HS credit recovery throughout the 
year. 

  Our department teams’ ongoing rounds of data analyses determined the MS & HS student rosters for our 

ongoing Saturday Academy: an additional layer of academic enrichment and support for targeted students. 

  UNITAS Therapeutic Community offers one-on-one counseling to our most at-risk high school students; 

particularly, our chronically absent students engaging in chemical substance abuse. In addition, a UNITAS 
social worker and social work intern lead a heterogeneous Advisory of acutely “at-risk” teens twice a week. 
  Our school-wide intervention team, or I-Team, has been re-configured and augmented to include one lead 

and two assistant deans of student life and culture who handle student infractions and disputes and train HS 
students in peer mediation techniques, two full-time DOE social workers, four social work MSW interns, and 
our parent coordinator. 

 

 
3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The school population comprises 78% Hispanic, 20% Black, 1% Asian or Hawaiian/PI and 1% White students. The 
student body includes 16% English Language Learners and 28% Special Education students. Boys account for 47% of 
the students enrolled and girls account for 53%. The average attendance rate for this school year is 90%. The ELL and 
Special Education population need specific scaffolding and strategies to make content accessible for them. We offer 
Integrated Co-Teaching classes, Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS), and 12:1:1 classes to meet the 
specific needs of the special education students, including a 12:1:1 grade 7-8 bridge class. Our special education 
population receives services in speech, occupational therapy and counseling, as well as uses adaptive technology. 

We utilize push in and pull out English as a Native Language (ENL) services to meet the specific needs of the varying 
language development of our English Language Learners. We service ELL students in Spanish, Arabic, French and 
Bengali. 

 
4.  Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the 

past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

Elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which the school has made the most progress: 

According to the 2017-2018 PPO our "Area of Celebration" was Supportive Environment and Trust. We scored a "well-
developed" in indicator 1.4: Maintain a cultural of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the academic and 
personal growth of students and adults. It was written that the school's approach to culture building, discipline, and 
social-emotional support are informed by a theory of action to develop scholar activists, which is entwined with 
advisory structures in place. The impact is that the theory of action results in a safe environment and inclusive culture 
that supports progress toward yearly goals and meaningfully involves student voice. 

 

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools which are our key focus in 2018-2019: 

 

Rigorous instruction: According to the 2016-2017 Quality Review an Area of Focus was in indicator 2.2 Assessment. 
The finding read that the school is developing their use of common assessments to measure student progress toward 
instructional and individual goals. Across classrooms, teachers' assessments practices are uneven and inconsistently 
reflect the use of ongoing checks for understanding and student self-assessment. The impact is that teachers 
inconsistently use results to adjust curricula and instruction, provide limited feedback regarding student achievement, 
or make effective in-the-moment adjustments to meet students' learning needs. The 2017-2018 PPOs also state that 
although there has been an improvement in cohesive assessments and collection of data, it still needs to be 
consistent throughout all disciplines. This remains to be our key area of focus for the 2018-2019 school year. 

 

Strong Family and Community Ties: Our Steering Committee, or SLT, and community school team, Global Kids Inc., 
shall cultivate a reliable cohort of ten “caregiver leaders” that will gradually be charged with the shared responsibility 
of leading two parent outreach campaigns with our parent coordinator, supporting ongoing attendance improvement 
initiatives with the Attendance Team and cluster teams, and co-facilitating four school-wide community-building 
events by the close of June 2019. 

 

 

5.  Identify at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify the 

instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content standards; 
provide time for collaboration on the use of data) to be implemented in the 2018-19 school year. 

The Turnaround Principle that is to be implemented for the 2018-2019 school year is: Strengthening the school's 
instructional program. We will have a more robust offering of high school classes with the inclusion of Geometry and 
Earth Science into the high school course offerings. We will continue to implement the new curriculum in 
mathematics for the middle school (Keys to Mathematical Success., KEMS, through National Training Network, NTN) a 
new science curriculum (LabAids and Inspire Science from MsGraw Hill) and have additional consultants to provide 
coaching for implementation of the new curriculum and to strengthened the cohesiveness of the high school 
curriculum. We have extended our AP offerings to include AP Environmental Science and AP Language.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Reflection: 

According to the school's 2018 PPO visit, an area of focus was to develop common assessments and design ongoing 
assessments throughout the lessons and units. On the 2018 ELA NYSCC exams, although we showed growth in our 
cohort to cohort data, we decreased in our year to year proficiency by 5%. 

Strengths: 

The school’s professional collaboration and distributed leadership structures have strengthened the instructional 
capacity of teachers as well as their involvement in school decision making across the school.. On the 2018 NYSCC 
exams, the school increase proficiency in Math by 6%. (data to be inserted).. (Math data to be inputted) 

Needs Improvement: 

As a school we need to create a comprehensive system for using formative and summative assessments to drive student 
achievement that involve student reflection and tracking of student learning. We need to begin deeper analysis of the 
data, generated by these assessments, by grade and teacher, and strengthen our curricula and tasks providing for more 
differentiation for individual learners. At the classroom level, this includes frequent small group instruction, skills

Reflection; 

Our learning community places a high premium on establishing meaningful and positive relationships with all students 
to enhance the quality of support as they encounter increasingly rigorous coursework and negotiate an increasingly 
complex world. Over the last five years we have made it a priority to re-introduce Advisory as the centerpiece of socio-
emotional learning and the principal organizing vehicle of the BSSWA Scholar-Activist community. 

Bronx Studio School for Writers and Artists has an advisory program on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Each student is paired 
with an advisor. The advisory groups are a ratio of 10 students per adult advisor. The advisors serve as the adult point 
person between parents and school. The advisors are responsible for parental outreach for students including any 
attendance issues. Attendance team member make daily phone calls for students who ate absent or chronically late. 
Our community school directors hold weekly raffles for students who arrive on time to school. 

 

Priority Needs:

Although we have these systems in place for parental outreach for absent students, our attendance rate declined from 
87.3% in 2016 - 2017 to 86% in 2017-2018. We need to continue outreach and grow and strengthen our attendance 
team. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, we will see a 5% increase in daily attendance as evidenced by the attendance reports in ATS.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Reflection: 

According to our 2018 PPO, while all students were compliant and working, there was a lack of cognitive engagement 
and rigor in the classrooms. Differentiation was lacking across the majority of classrooms. 

 

Priority Focus: 

Our instructional focus for the 2017-2018 school year was to promote student to student discourse using text-based 
answers and citing evidence. The evidence supporting our developing rating on the Quality Review was that students 
discussions were rooted in students' morel and ethical beliefs, and not in a text. The findings stated that the 
implementation of student-centered discussion were inconsistent across the school. The focus for the 2018-2019 school 
year is: students will engage in rigorous instruction, encompassing high expectations, critical thinking and problem 
solving with the goal of helping students develop the capacity to understand complex content. .

Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

16 

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

Students in temporary housing are paired with specific Advisors and LSWs. There is a social worker designated as our 
STH liaison to offer counseling and referrals to outside services. Our CBO partners also make it a high priority to

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Bronx Studio Schools for Writers and Artists believe that that hiring, developing and retaining highly qualified staff is 
the crux to producing a highly effective learning environment. When vacancies are posted, resumes are vetted by the 
principal, her administrative cabinet and the hiring committee. Recruitment: Teach For America, Math for America, 
NYC Teaching Fellows, multi-stage interview process that includes a demo lesson, student teacher pipeline, and hiring 
substitute teachers to develop as teachers. 

 

To develop and support staff we offer professional development: weekly meetings with coach, collaborative planning, 
quick feedback, using teacher data to craft individualized PD plan, and “mentor buddies”. We design our schedule to 
allow for department common planning meeting three times a week and grade level/cluster meetings and 
departments meetings every other week. 

Over the summer we offer a New Faculty institute (NFI) that continues to convenes once a month throughout the 
school year. The mission of the NFI is to have a supportive, non threatening place where new teachers can learn, 
express concerns and receive the wisdom of highly qualified teachers and administration. 

To retain highly qualified staff we offer leadership development and opportunities: LEAP apprenticeships, department 
chairpersons, cluster coordinators, ENL coordinator, special ed liaison, testing coordinator, Peer Collaborative 
Teachers and Model Teachers. We are a "Teachers of Tomorrow" School which gives stipends to new teachers who 
are rated Effective or Highly Effective according to the Danielson rubric.

scholars in each class. 
Strategically employ a variety of research-based checks for understanding (proven to be highly effective over 
the course of each daily lesson).  

  Accurately and regularly monitor student progress (progress monitoring). 
  Provide highly accessible and targeted feedback to students in a timely and consistent fashion.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Bronx Studio School for Writers and Artists , in compliance with the Section 
1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Bronx Studio School for Writers and Artists will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

Bronx Studio School for Writers and Artists' Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment 
of the needs of all parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with 
disabilities. The school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent 
involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation 
through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of 
parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          49

lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work. 

Bronx Studio School for Writers and Artists and the School Community Director (SCD) partner together to implement 
support, activities and resources to enrich the school climate, ELT opportunities, attendance improvement efforts, 
family engagement and community service projects.  

The ELT, After School and Saturday programs will be tailored based on students’ choice and the school’s 
recommendation. 

Parents are welcomed to attend our SLT meetings, parent meetings or request a meeting with school administration. 
Our community school forum reflects on the accomplishments of the past year, and an overview of our direction for 
next year. Parents were given a detailed survey so school administration can include their input in planning for the 
following year. 

CSD meets with school administration at least one time a week. CSD is a part of the attendance meetings and is 
involved with using the Data Sorter to assist in action plans for students.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
Towards the goal of increasing achievement for our ELL students, we provide additional support 
after school two days a week provided both by of our ENL teachers and content teachers.  The 
ENL teachers will team teach each Title III class after school for two days a week, Wednesday 
and Thursday, (2:45 - 3:45) and on Saturdays (9:00 - 12:00).  These sessions will start on 
October 10, 2018 and end on May 16,  2019. There will be a total of 4 hours for 15 weeks  for 3 
teachers. This will leave us with $41.00 that will be paid from our school budget.   The teachers, 
with the support of school administration and office staff, will contact and work with families to 
make sure that all our beginner, intermediate and advanced ELL students attend as well as our 
full immigrant population.  All our English Language Learners need additional support as 
indicated by their NYSESLAT, ELA state tests and Regents exams. The students will 
attend Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.   Middle School students will be grouped 
according to grade.  High School students will be grouped according to level.  After school 
instruction infuses non-fiction and fiction texts aligned with the Common Core State Standards 
and HS standards, again, to accelerate students' English language acquisition and literacy 
skills.  These courses are all taught in English but  native language support is provided for our 
entire immigrant population.  This additional after-school instructional time is different from the 
students’ coursework but also indirectly prepares the students for the NYSESLAT, Regents, and 
MS ELA examinations.   Students read texts taken from the Common Core library. Additionally, 
students have access to dictionaries, both in print and digital. Beyond supplemental texts that 
include informational and non-fiction texts, students have access to our school’s library which 
houses a broad selection fiction and non-fiction books across grade levels. Title III funds will be 
used to purchase additional books that meet students' reading levels and interests.  Students are 
also provided with Prentice Hall Regents and MS ELA test preparation materials.   On 
Saturdays, students will be invited to participate in enrichment trips that are academic and 
culturally based.  We will also renew our Rosetta News licenses.

Part C: Professional Development  
have attended professional development programs put on by the Department of English 
Language Learners Student Support, our district team and the Bronx Field Support Center 
(BFSC).  Our three ENL teachers will have the option to attend NYS TEOSOL conferences 
locally and nationally and university-based trainings (Fordham University).   We have also 
established a differentiated PD group charged with strengthening the scaffolds and supports and 
language objectives in teachers; lesson and unit plans.  Our lead ENL teacher also belongs to the 
Bronx Field Support Center (BFSC) professional Learning Community(PLC) for teachers of 
ELL students. 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact 
higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as 
parent orientation during ELL identification process.

Begin description here:            
Parental support and involvement is absolutely essential to the success of our ELLs.  In the spirit, 
we have designed several vehicles to cultivate parental participation and indirectly improve 
student performance.   
Parents and families will always be invited to join the teacher and students on Saturday activity 
sessions.  We also are holding a Parent Summit meetings in November, February and March. In 
addition to celebrating student success, we are inviting our ELL families to come an hour earlier 
to introduce and expand exposure to community based organizations that can support the success 
of our ELL students. One organization we are inviting is our CBO,  Global KIds, Inc, an 
organization that assists people in obtaining educational services and building leadership within 
the community. Because most of our ELLs are Spanish-speaking, this organization's ability to 
assist families with legal, financial and educational services has proven extremely helpful. We 
also connect families with Bronx Works, an organization that provides legal assistance. These 
organizations work to ensure that our ELL families are able to provide a safe and secure home 
environment for their students. 
Once a week a program will be offered for parents of ELL students to improve their English 
language skills.  The program will be conducted by a certified ENL teacher.  School laptop 
computers will be available to ELL parents once a week and parent volunteers will be available 
to assist parents. The Parent Coordinator will be in charge of coordinating the volunteer 
schedule.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The assessment tools we use to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLS are Fountas and Pinnell and teacher-created 
assessments which we administer four times a year to measure baseline and progress and establish a breakdown of strengths 
and weaknesses in reading comprehension, writing,  speaking and literacy skills. Results are shared with content area teachers 
across each instructional team.  With this information we are able to tailor interventions toward areas of need and provide 
extra help geared toward the particular needs of each student. The information we gather from these initial assessments, as 
well as the ongoing ones, informs our instructional plan, the design of curriculum, interventions and helps us ensure that we 
are addressing the specific needs of all students. Our teachers work to develop reading and writing skills through all content 
areas.  Through this consistent reinforcement of reading and writing in their classes as well as in our after school academic 
clinic and Saturday programming, students see improvement, in their scores over time. 
      
 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We use IO Education (formerly DataCation) to create assessments and collect data for analysis and tracking of student 
progress towards mastery of language acquisition and CCLS. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Using many of the data points described above as well as student work, the ENL coordinator and the Assistant Principal 
monitor ELL progress and adjust the program to allow at risk students to get more support.  The academic clinic's impact is 
analyzed through a system of short reading and writing passages to determine progress, unit summative assessments are 
collected and analyzed by both the Assistant Principal, the ELA team and the ENL teachers to monitor and determine next 
steps.  The students will be administered the EdPerformance three times a year in both reading and math.  This year the 
students will be assessed using the ELL Periodic Assessment in the Fall and the Spring.  We will analyze this data to evaluate 
the success of our program. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

In addition to the required minutes of services that our ELL students receive we offer academic clinic in Wednesdays and 
Thursdays as well as Saturday academy to ensure academic progress of our ELL students. These sessions are taught by a 
certified ENL teachers.   The ENL After School and Saturday Programs are designed to ensure that the English Language 
Learners develop their language skills in the four modalities, Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing, therefore, they are able 
to achieve proficiency of more rigorous language demands. As students develop higher levels of academic language and learn 
more content, they need less support to access the curriculum. In these programs teachers differentiate content by varying 
instructional techniques and materials. This includes varying the complexity of assignments, asking leveled questions, offering 
leveled texts and using different resources and materials that cover the same concepts but vary in levels of difficulty and 
abstraction. Students are exposed to language through a variety of activities, such as, reading comprehension activities 
according to their language acquisition, full-color books with photos and illustrations to support visual learners, graphic 
organizers to provide comprehensible input, instructional activities that address multiple learning modalities, flexible reading 
and writing activities. The purpose of these programs is to prepare the ELL's for the English Language Arts (ELA) exam and 
the New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) respectively. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 Our school is a 6 - 12 school. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We analyze the data received from NYSELAT There is no distinct patterns or correlation on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT and 
student's grades.  The students that have entered our school and have been administered the NYSITELL were unable to take 
the exam, therefore scoring a 0.  Although students receive ENL services and the majority of instruction is in English, students 
are provided with translated versions of class work, tasks and text books.  Teachers pair up students with bilingual students of 
their native language to assist in translation.  Due to these accommodations, the students tend to score higher grades in their 
subjects than they score on the NYSESLAT or NYSITELL levels.   Based on the 2017 exam, in grade 6 we have 8 Expanding, and 7 
Transitioning. In grade 7 there is 1 Entering, 1 Emerging, 2 Transitioning and 7 Expanding. In grade 8 there are 1 Entering, 1 
Emerging, 3 Transitioning and 8 Expanding. in grade 9 we have 1 Emerging, 6 Transitioning and 10 Expanding.  In grade 10 we 
have 2 Emerging, 2 Transitioning and 9 Expanding.  In grade 11 we have 10 Expanding.  This informs our grouping and push in 
supports, particularly students with different strengths in the 4 processes. 
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 
All our data is collected and entered into a data sheet which is color coded for the levels based on the scale for each 
exam.  This spreadsheet is then analyzed by the ENL coordinator/teachers, content teachers, data specialist and AP in charge 
of ENL. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Based on CR Part 154, our students in Freestanding ENL program receive standalone ENL or integrated ENL.  We 
utilize the pull-out model for our ELL students who require standalone ENL.  Our entering and emerging ELLs are 
grouped for pull out sessions and meet four times per week for 45 minutes. Our integrated ENL, for all levels or 
language development,  consists of our ENL teacher pushing into our ELA classes 2 to 4 times per week for 45 minutes 
in sixth, seventh and eighth grade depending on required minutes. Our ENL teachers alos push into math and social 
studies classes for integrated co-teaching classes. Our students are grouped heterogeneously by grade level. ELL 
students receive academic support during Saturday academy in ELA and Math, as well as enrichment, social and 
emotional experiences where they practice fluency in a social setting.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           As per the new CR Part 154 requirements, students are.carefully programmed to receive the mandated ENL and ELA 
instructional minutes based on new proficiency guidelines.  Entering students will receive a minimum of 540 minutes of ENL 
per week (this consists of 180 minutes of ENL standalone, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and 180 minutes of standalone 
or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area). Emerging students will receive 360 minutes of ENL per week (this 
consists of 90 minutes of standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA  and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL 
with ELA or any other content area.) Transitioning students will receive 180 ENL minutes per week (this consists of 90 minutes 
of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content 
area). Expanding students will receive 180 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or 
other content area.) Commanding or  students who are former ELL's will receive 90 minutes of ENL each week (this consists of 
90 integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.)  
We have a series of delivery models to ensure that each student receives these mandated ENL and ELA minutes through co-
taught  classes with a certified ENL teacher and a certified content area teacher. In addition, all of our content area teachers 
are trained in language development and ENL methodologies and encouraged to pursue ENL certification.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Our ENL teachers as well as all of our content area teachers provide content area support for ELLs through all content area 
classes. All students take math, science, social studies, and ELA every year.  Although the language that teachers use from the 
front of the room is English, the language of instruction for specific projects and on any specific day is collaboratively 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

determined – students use both English and their native languages to explore content and the locus of control for language is 
student-driven by the content and the students’ needs.  Instruction is not unidirectional from teacher to student in our 
school.  Students work in groups to complete collaborative tasks that both develop language and content knowledge. 
 
We have partnered with Theater Moves to help develop the academics across four modalities of reading, writing, listening and 
speaking.  Their physicalization of language approach & compassion as teaching artists, create a nurturing environment that 
sparks students with the courage to exercise productive language in a fun, safe, workshop setting.  They provide students with 
opportunities to gain confidence in English, writing, speaking and clarity of communication. 
 
Our Freestanding ENL Program provides instruction in English concentrating on English language acquisition.  We provide 
support in numerous other avenues: bilingual dictionaries are available in the classrooms; and we have acquired translation 
technology that students can utilize in their classrooms.  All the curriculum used in all content areas are aligned to the 
Common Core Learning Standards and the required Instructional Shifts.  In addition,  ENL strategies and scaffolds are also 
utilized in the major content areas (Science, Social Studies, Math and ELA) in the general education classroom (taught in 
English), in which our ELL population are regularly scheduled. For instance:•    Modeling which includes walking students 
through an interaction during a required task together first, or providing students with clear examples of how students from 
prior years accomplished the task.•    Bridging forces connection between new concepts and language and previous 
knowledge, a necessary component of all learning.  It occurs when students are asked to activate their prior knowledge in 
anticipation of learning new information and when personal links are made between the new subject matter and students’ 
knowledge and experience.•    Text re-presentation is the recreation of concepts and language from one genre to another.  In 
representing information from an article in a poster or play, students can access content presented in a more difficult genre as 
they transform it into an easier genre to produce.  Examples of text re-presentation include asking students to transform 
scientific content into a friendly letter to a peer or family member, changing a poem into a narrative or a narrative into a 
play.    
 
The instructional method used in delivering content area instruction is through the Internationals Network for Public Schools 
(INPS) Approach.  This research-based instructional approach utilizes five strategies which foster language development and 
meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.  They consist of heterogeneity and collaboration, experiential and 
project based learning, language and content integration, localized autonomy and responsibility and one learning model for 
all.  A variety of instructional materials are used such as: laptops, library books, work books, dictionaries and teacher-
generated activities.  Our educational principles include an approach to curriculum that is student-centered, inquiry- driven, 
and project-based, revolving around themes and essential questions that provide a balance between content and English 
language skill building.  Small, heterogeneous grouping within classes provides a powerful vehicle for English acquisition, 
wherein students from diverse language backgrounds use English to accomplish a given task, drawing on their native language 
as a resource.  Language and literacy are developed through interaction with peers and teachers about meaningful ideas in 
authentic context.   
 
In order to provide our students with native language support in the content area we provide our students with bilingual 
dictionaries, peer group support, native language texts, as well as bilingual paraprofessionals to assist in the classroom. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Newly identified Spanish speaking ELLs are administered the Spanish LAB upon entering the school district.  All state exams 
and Regents (excluding English and English Language Arts) are translated in the students native language or the student is 
providing with an interpreter.  EdPerformance Series is administered in Spanish for mathematics.   ELL’s are appropriately 
evaluated using the instructional strategies as described in Question # 5 (a-e) below.

e. 

Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

All students who are identified as SIFE students (Students with Interrupted/Inconsistant Formal Education) are immediately 
placed in our SIFE program where they receive additional support in English literacy until a level of proficiency is achieved as 
determined by the SIFE coordinator and the SIFE leadership team along with the student’s individual teachers and guidance 
counselors.  The common denominator among these students is a weakness or inability to read or write in their native 
language.  Teachers and guidance counselors identify students who meet this profile through an examination of report cards, 
educational history and student work, student/parent interviews and teachers referrals.  Once students are identified to enter 
the SIFE program, our challenge is to find ways to teach students to read and write in English and acquire content knowledge 
when they have limited, if any, literacy skills in any language and may also have serious affective issues as well.   
In order to service students who are struggling, each team has provided extra services:  including one-on-one work with a 
paraprofessional, small group instruction, and after school tutoring.  School-wide, a Saturday enrichment program has been 
established, and changes in student programs (such as an extra language arts period) have been made.  Over the past four 
years with the money’s from the SIFE grant literacy program an accelerated literacy program was implemented school-wide 
and met with enthusiasm by staff, students and parents. 
Our SIFE model requires three important features: 
•     An intensive Language Arts period is held during the regular core daily program to accelerate learning taught by a specially 
trained literacy ENL licensed teacher in small group settings of five to ten students in which instruction is guided by individual 
students’ needs.  This class is focused on reading comprehension, reading fluency and vocabulary development based on high 
interest topics drawn from the social studies curriculum. 
•     Scaffolding students’ work in regular heterogeneous classes for most of the school day by developing collaboration 
between the SIFE teacher and content area teachers to generalize and practice newly learned skills and strategies across a 
variety of settings.  A team teaching approach would be used in which the SIFE teacher plans with the content areas teacher, 
works with SIFE students in the classroom daily to implement strategies, and also meets after class sessions with the content 
area teacher to discuss students’ work and review lessons and activities. 
•     All SIFE students are expected to attend academic clinic and are also enrolled in our weekly Saturday Explorers club which 
serves to enhance their literacy skills through exploration of NYC and its environment. 
•     Our SIFE Leadership team has completed a SIFE toolkit which will be shared with other SIFE schools throughout the city.   
•     Our SIFE Leadership team has also hosted a series of Open Houses over the past four years for SIFE Teachers from 
throughout the city in order to share best practices among educators of SIFE as well as all ELL students. 
  
b)     Instructional Plan for Newcomer ELL Students: 
Newcomers to the school, along with their parents, meet initially with a guidance counselor who assesses their needs and 
academic development during intake.  All new students and their parents receive an orientation developed by the guidance 
staff along with the parent coordinator.  All students new to the United States and to NYC are given the NYSITELL exam which 
assesses the students English language abilities.  For students transferring in from NYC schools, test results are reviewed and 
students are then matched with teams of teachers who it is felt would best meet the needs of the specific student.  Students 
are placed in appropriate classes according to their specific needs.  The teachers meet in team to discuss the specific needs of 
all new students.  A plan is formulated to best meet the needs of each particular student. 
  
c)     Instructional Plan for Developing ELL's: 
The plan for developing ELLs receiving  service for 4-6 years consists of ongoing support and mentoring. ELLs with 4-6 years of 
service are placed in appropriate classes to best meet their needs and continue their English language development.  Their 
teachers meet regularly in teams to discuss the needs fo the specific students.  A plan is formulated and updated regularly to 
meet the needs of each student.  ELLs who are receiving service for 4-6 years receive a full program and receive all the same 
support structures as the rest of our ELL poplulations.  Struggling ELLs who are receiving 4-6 years of service are encouraged 
and often mandated to avail themselves of all the extra support opportunities provided to all the students at large.  This help 
takes the form of one-on-one mentoring, small group instruction, after school homework help, the Saturday literacy program 
as well as a variety of other activities.  ELLs with 4-6 years of service are encouraged to try to take some college classes to help 
them to begin the transition towards college life.  These ELLs with 4-6 years who meet regularly with their guidance counselor 
and teachers on their team to receive support and feedback to help assess in their language development.

d)     Instructional Plan for Long Term ELL's: 
The plan for long term ELLs consists of ongoing support and mentoring.  Long term ELLs continue with a full program whether 
they are with us 5 or 6 years and retain all of the same support structures in place for the entire student 
population.  Struggling long term ELLs are encouraged to take advantage of all extra help opportunities provided to the 
students at large.   This extra help takes the form of one-on-one mentoring, small group instruction, after school homework 
help, writing center as well as a variety of other activities.  Whenever possible, long-term ELLs are encouraged to begin taking 
college classes to help them to begin the transition towards college life.  International High School long term ELLs regularly 
begin taking remedial college classes.  All long term ELLs in college classes receive support from a high school teacher mentor. 
  
e)     Instructional Plan for Former ELL's up to 2 years after exiting ELL status): 
Students who reach proficiency and test at Commanding through the NYSESLAT assessment, are entitled to receive 90 minutes 
per week of integrated ENL and ELA or other content area for two years.  They are also entitled to receive ELL testing 
accommodations for two years after testing at Commanding level.  Students receive higher levels of project opportunities and 
also have the opportunity to take college classes in any of their academic areas.  Our school offers these students the 
opportunity to take College Now classes through CUNY at Hostos and Bronx Community College.  Students who are 
determined to have reached proficiency continue to receive support from their teachers as needed.  All former ELLs in college 
classes receive support from a high school teacher mentor. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELL-SWDs are provided with the same curriculum as all students in their grade level.  The curriculum is modified by the special 
education and the ENL teachers to meet the specific language or academic needs of the student.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Student with ELL identification who also have and IEP receive all required minutes based on their level and all mandated 
services outline in their Individualized Education Plans (IEP).  We use curricula, instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet 
the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least restrictive environment by programming our ELL-SWDs along general education 
students.  All ELLs are leveled by Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding or Commanding.  The students are placed int eh 
special education setting as described in their IEP.  If the student receives ICT programming, an ENL certified teacher joins the 
already co-taught classroom to offer ENL support to the ELL students.  The same is true for self-contained special education 
students or students who receive SETSS services. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention programs for ELLs are similar to those in the General Education program.  Intervention is targeted and 
specific.  An ELL student who is recommended, by their classroom teacher, to the school implementation  team (comprised of 
the guidance counselor, assistant principal, IEP team, attendance teacher and invited teacher guests) are prescribed a variety 
of intervention services based on need.  Student intervention services include, small group instruction that mimics the day 
instruction (extended day program, all four subjects), guided reading support (ELA and SS), and push-in services by licensed 
teachers.  Intervention and service support correspond to each ELLs' age and grade level. We also offer an after school and 
Saturday intervention program (ELA and Math) designed specifically for the ELL students. These targeted intervention services 
are for all four content areas, ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies.   We offer an after school program for ELL students on 
Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:45 to 4:45 in our school. The ENL and the content teachers work collaboratively and are in 
charge of running this intervention program.  Throughout this program ELLs are grouped according to their language 
progression. The Entering level students are grouped homogeneously.  These students share similar needs, strengths and 
weaknesses.   On the other hand, the Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding leveled students work together..  The instruction 
for this group of students is with Focused Reading Intervention. We understand that an effective intervention program can 
make the difference between struggle and success for students. The Focused Reading Intervention program includes explicit 
instruction, guided lessons, engaging reading passages, educational games, and multiple opportunities to practice. Learning to

read is a complex process. Most children learn to read and continue to grow in their mastery of this process. However, there 
continues to be a group of children for whom learning to read is a struggle.  All students, including ELL-SWDs are encouraged 
and afforded the opportunity to attend academic clinic on Tuesdays and Wednesday after school and Saturday 
Academy.  Students who require further academic intervention will receive AIS which will target specific skills to ensure 
academic progress and mastery towards the CCLS. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We will not be implementing new programs this upcoming school year. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We did not have a bilingual program. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All students are afforded equal access to all school programs.  No student or subgroup of students are discriminated against in 
participating on school programs.  The academic clinic, sports, and Saturday academy are offered to all students in our 
building. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The students in middle school use Core Ready for reading, Teacher's College Writing Project for Writing, National Training 
Network (NTN) Keys to Mathematical Success (KEMS) for math, Passport for social studies and we have adopted a new science 
curriuclum, McGraw Hill Inspire Science. This curriculum identifies scaffolds and differentiation for the ELL students which each 
of their lessons.   The ELL students in the class use the same curricula with modifications allowing for access to learning.  The 
high school students use curricula aligned to the standards, regents and college readiness which is modified for the ELL 
students allowing access to learning. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

When possible students are paired with classmates that speak their native language to help with the acclimation to the school 
and the English language.  All Regents and state exams (excluding English and ELA) are translated or interpreted in the students 
native language.  We have native language dictionaries which are accessible to students as well as technology based 
translation programs. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The curriculum used in the content areas for our ELL populations are all on grade level and aligned to the CCLS and 
Regents.  The curriculum used in the ENL program align to the grade level and language level. 
 
Our instructional teams meet regularly to ensure that required services and supports correspond to ELLs' age and grade 
levels.  All of the required services for high school-aged ELLs are available to students. We use a wide array of resources in our 
school including teacher-made materials, text books on a range of levels, trade books at many reading levels, and a large 
variety of non-text hands on materials.  In addition, our school has wireless access in all classrooms and students use the 
Internet to access resources.  If a teacher or instructional team is having problems locating published materials that are 
appropriate to the age of the ELLs then the instructional teams work together to create an adapt material which will be 
appropriate to the age level of the ELL.  Our teachers understand the importance of utilizing materials and resources for the 
ELL’s appropriate age level in order to keep them engaged in learning.  In addition, instructional teams are encouraged to 
attend professional development workshops throughout the year in order to help them better meet the needs of ELLs with age 
and grade level appropriate to the content of the classes.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We are  a Middle School of Choice and the incoming 6th grade students are invited to attend an orientation along with their 
parents.  In November,  we have an open house for all interested incoming students for the next school year.  Students that 
enroll throughout the year are placed in a classroom with other students from similar backgrounds and/or language as well as 
given a tour of the building (both student and parent). We offer a two day Summer Bridge program for all incoming 6th 
graders. During the interview stage for new admits, both the parent and student meet with the ENL coordinator to help 
complete the application process and describe the program we offer at Bronx Studio School for Writers and Artists. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A:    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
In order to support professional development, teachers meet in teams, during departmental common planning periods, cluster 
meeting and department meetings to discuss best practices, create and analyze common assessments, and look at student 
work.  With the support of our Borough Field Office, teachers participate in workshops and other professional development 
opportunities to strengthen their understanding of the ELL student and share teaching strategies.  Teachers of ENL and of 
content areas attended professional learning venues of Election day.  We also sent out teachers to professional development 
series pertaining to teaching the ELL students.  Our content teachers and administrators have participated in PD focusing on 
scaffolds to utilize when teaching ELL students.  
 
In turn, the ENL teachers shares the strategies with the general education teachers during common planning periods.  We have 
sent teachers to Core Ready, Teacher's College, and NTN, training to learn the common core aligned curriculum and how to 
deliver instruction.  We have consultants for ELA, Math, Social Studies and Science to support our teachers and our ENL 
teacher is a member of the District ENL Professional Learning Community.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Most professional development opportunities are done "in-house" during professional learning team meetings. Teacher plan 
together and discuss teaching strategies to assist English Language Learners, students with disabilities and students in the 
bottom third.  The ENL teachers join the subject area common planning meetings periodically throughout the year in order to 
share insights about the students, as well as best practices with the general education teachers. We will dedicate a minimum 
of 15% of the required professional development hours for all teachers, to language acquisition including a focus on best 
practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs. For our ENL teachers 50% of the 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          72 

 

 

required professional development hours will be dedicated to the above.  Agendas and sign-in sheets are maintained for all 
professional development to keep a record of hours which are kept in the main office, with the ENL coordinator as well as by 
the assistant principal in charge of the ENL department.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
During parent engagement sessions on Mondays, meetings are planned with parents to discuss ELL students' progress. These 
will be done with the ENL teachers who, in conjunction with the classroom teacher can speak to the students' goals, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results and language development needs in all content areas. 
Interpreters and translators will be provided on the basis of need as often as possible.  All agendas, sign in shets and logs will 
be kept in the main office, as well as the AP in charge of the ENL department. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents of our ELLs are invited to all activities we host at Bronx Studio School for Writers and Artists (BSSWA)  Our parent 
coordinator posts a list of all workshops and events occurring at BSSWA each month.  In addition the pamphlets  for these 
programs are back packed with each student.  Our parent coordinator also hosts events which are in coordination with the 
parental engagement on Monday afternoons.  In addition to those workshops/meetings, we host two workshops specifically 
for our ELL parents.  These workshops included discussions on our ENL program, curriculum, and assessments students will 
take throughout the school year. All of the meetings that are held are sent out through School Messenger to the parents.  All 
correspondence to parents are offered in the parent's preferred language.  We monitor attendance by having sign-in sheets, 
which are are held by the Parent Coordinator as well as the Principal's secretary.  If any parent is in need of translation services 
that we can not provide in-house we utilize the translation services provided by the city of New York.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dawn Verhille, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Upon registering a new student to the NYCDOE, parents are provided with the Home Language Identification 
survey. This survey is used to inform the school what is the oral and written language preference of the parent. 
The information is then entered into ATS to be shared with staff. The blue cards that are given to the parents also 
asked for the parents language preference for oral and written communication. 

Based on the Home Language Identification Survey, a record of adult preferred languages for written translation 
and oral interpretation are maintained in ATS: English 62%, Spanish - 36%, Bengali - 0.5%, French - 0.5%; Fulani - 
0.5%, Arabic - 1.0%, Oneida 0.5% Copies of said information are shared with our Guidance Counselor, Parent 
Coordinator, Community Coordinator, student advisers and others. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          76 

 

All written correspondence between the school and students’ families is provided in the language of their choice, 
which most often is in their native language. As a result, we use the NYCDOE’s internal translation unit to provide 
translations of all school correspondence in Arabic, Bengali, French, Haitian-Creole, and Spanish. 

 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

All our correspondence via our school messenger are translated into Spanish since that is our largest non-English 
speaking population. We will utilize the interpretation services provided by the DOE to reach parents of students who 
speak a language other than English or Spanish. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

We hold our staff meeting on the first day of the school year. This is the time we disseminate all the pertinent 
information to the staff. They are given the Community Handbook with all highlighted Chancellor's Regulations, 
including A-663. The assistant principal explains all highlighted regulations with the staff and explains all available 
resources. During a Monday afternoon professional development venue we will hold a professional development 
session exclusively on translations and interpretation services.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Chancellor's Regulation A-663 is a directive on the responsibility that our school system is committed to for the 
opportunity of equal access to all rights, opportunity, information, and participation of LEP parents in our school. A 
parent will never be denied access to opportunities afforded their families, or to children enrolled at our school. As a 
result of these regulations, we have developed systems that will meet the needs of parents of ELLs who speak the 
predominant second language, Spanish and less prevalent languages represented in our school. 

Additionally, Item B of Section VII in the Chancellor's Regulations relates to the conspicuous posting of DOE covered 
languages for translation. This appears upon entry to the school near the Security Desk. The school's safety plan 
provides that parents who need to communicate with the school, does so in their home language. This is determined 
via the Parents Preferred Language Form, which is available as part of the Family Resources through the Office of ELLs. 
Behind the safety officers desk is also a sign giving the phone number for the interpreter services to assist a parent. 
Upon registration parents are given the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities and the Parent's Guide to Language 
Access in English or one of the nine offered languages. If a parent requests a plan or any other information in their 
home language, we will utilize the translation department and provide them with a translated version in their home 
language. 

All school based and consultant agencies will be utilized to this end, including community based organizations that will 
be instrumental in meeting the language needs of our parents.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We will gather data in reference to quality and availability of service from the parent survey. We will recruit parents 
inclusive of all cultures and languages represented in our school to be a focus group to gather feedback and best 
practices on use of the available services.
