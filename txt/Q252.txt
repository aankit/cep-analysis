Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The mission of the Queens School of Inquiry (QSI), an Early College Initiative School is to provide engaging, student-
centered mastery-based learning to all students in grades 6 through 12. Our inclusive environment is designed to 
support the whole child and prepare students to enter and successfully complete college early. Students at the 
Queens School of Inquiry have the opportunity to earn up to 62 tuition free college credits while still in high school. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

We expect our students to become compassionate, successful, and self-confident adults who value a lifetime of 
learning. Our four Core Values are: 

 

Collaboration 

Inquiry 

Perseverance 

Universal Literacy 

 

Beginning in the 6th grade, the Queens School of Inquiry (QSI) prepares students by developing academic skills 
aligned to a standards based assessment learning model. Students realize their goals in an inclusive environment that 
promotes inquiry-based learning, self-management and leadership. 

 

A close collaboration with CUNY Queens College, the greater City University of New York, ASD Nest, Facing History 
and Ourselves, Middle School Quality Initiative and a dedicated and expert teaching faculty, helps us promote college 
and career readiness. We are a neighborhood school that emphasizes real life applications in our effort to educate 
caring and ethical citizens. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Queens School of Inquiry is a student-centered environment where every child is known well by at least one 
adult. The school is dean-free and staffed by school counselors and a social worker who attend to the students’ social-
emotional needs and help maintain a high level of respect between and among staff, students, families and the 
community.  

 

All aspects of the school environment were deliberately designed to create a college ready culture. Students sit in the 
hallways in between their college campus classes and HS classes and lunch. The main office is an open space where 
students are encouraged to spend time meeting with teachers, studying and talking. The Guidance Suite is an open 
space where students have access to the School Counselors and college preparation materials. By Junior year, 
students who have earned the privilege, travel back and forth between the high school and CUNY Queens College 
where they take classes among the matriculating college students. Seniors who qualify are registered for waiver 
classes; courses chosen by interest where they may be the only high school student in attendance. Ultimately, 
students have the opportunity to earn up to 62 tuition-free college credits prior to graduating high school. This aspect 
of school culture is supported by a Seminar class, at each grade level, 9-12, co-taught by school counselors, 
administrators and teachers.  

Curricular, pedagogical and assessment practices are aligned with our school’s philosophy that students learn best in 
an inclusive environment where inquiry, collaboration, perseverance and literacy are celebrated. Academic rigor is 
determined by how deeply the students internalize content, apply what they learn and transfer their learning across 
curriculum to unique, real life experiences. Beginning in 2015, QSI adopted Marzano rubrics and transitioned fully to a 
mastery-based system that utilizes standards-based rubrics to support academic growth. Rubrics measure student 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

academic achievement, and there are companion rubrics measuring college readiness. Both are used to determine 
whether students meet pre-requisites for enrolling at the college.  

 

We begin in the sixth grade already with a focus on inviting students into a self-directed college going culture. 
Programs in place to support middle school students’ trajectory toward college are:  

● College Immersion: A full immersion program for middle school students to gain an understanding of college 
coursework and college ready behaviors. Graduates regularly point to College Immersion as being of great influence in 
their decision to stay at QSI for high school and in becoming college ready. 

● Career Day: An established event that helps students identify potential careers and learn from professionals. 
Students meet with professionals in a multi-tiered process that allows for getting to know professionals through a 
large lecture, small intimate groupings and one-on-one during a special lunch. Student evaluations reveal that 
students make connections between going to college and career readiness as a result of their participation in Career 
Day.  

● Middle School Quality Initiative: In 2018, QSI became an MSQI school. All sixth and seventh grade students are 
scheduled for a full literacy period every day. The partnership includes extensive support and training for teachers, 
and acts as a springboard for further developing a culture of literacy. Reading and writing on or above grade level is 
the key indicator for success in college.  

● Facing History and Ourselves: In 2018, QSI became a Facing History school. This means all teachers and students 
participate in at least one unit of study related to the learning promoted by Facing History. Facing History's mission is 
aligned to ours. According to their website, the goal is to, "integrate the study of history, literature and human 
behavior with ethical decision making and innovative teaching strategies." 

● Clubs and extracurricular activities: Provided to middle school students during their lunch period. A teacher led 
SBO gave staff the opportunity to use their professional assignments 2-3 times per week to lead interest based clubs 
as a means of further developing the school culture and teaching students early on of the importance of building a 
well-rounded college resume. Additionally, clubs, activities and our Enrichment Days are designed with student 
interests in mind. We use the Renzulli enrichment model as a means to hone in on students abilities and interests and 
celebrate these while extending learning opportunities to all.  

● Health and Wellness: A course introduced in the 2015-16 school year. Along with High School and College 
Seminars, students use these courses to explore the ways in which learning and reflective practice connect with civic 
responsibility and mindfulness. As the cornerstone of their portfolio development, students are given the space to 
reflect on their learning and experiences and set SMART goals to help them move toward greater success.  

Annually since July 2013, rising Seniors have traveled to Paris, France, Barcelona, Spain, London, England, Florence 
and Rome, Italy, Iceland and Japan, respectively, as part of a CUNY Queens College/Queens School of Inquiry 
collaborative study abroad program. Our high school students are enrolled in credit bearing college history, art, 
science or business courses. The students go to class every morning for three hours at a local university, and spend 
their afternoons on excursions connected to what they are learning in class. Students will travel to Barcelona in 2019 
to study studio art in context.  

We celebrate our students successfully earning college credit while in high school. We boast graduation rates above 
90% for every year we have graduated a cohort since 2012. Many of our alumni graduate Queens School of Inquiry

program, our newest collaboration with CUNY Queens College, is one more exciting way we prepare our students for 
a successful college experience. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The Queens School of Inquiry is an ASD Nest school. ASD Nest serves students on the Autism spectrum. The program 
supports full inclusion. Students are supported by a second teacher in all classrooms, including art, music and physical 
education. Additionally, specific courses are designed by the speech provider and occupational therapist to provide 
social-emotional support. All Queens School of Inquiry students benefit from the classroom structures imposed by the 
ASD Nest program and the promotion of full-inclusion throughout the school community.  

Overall, QSI was designed on the principle of inclusion. More than 80% of classes, grades 6-12, are co-taught, and we 
celebrate our co-teaching partnerships. This means there are no pull-out services for any student population. 
Students are taught early on to use teachers' "office hours" when they require additional support. Since 2016, one of 
our teachers has been devoted entirely to supporting SWDs and ENLs in transitioning to college early. Her role 
includes helping students facilitate their IEP meetings, disclose to the college's disabilities office and directly teach 
Executive Functioning skills to support students' independence at the college.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

In 2016-17, the staff of Queens School of Inquiry made a concerted effort to enhance instruction and transition fully 
to mastery based learning. We looked at Scholastic Reading Inventory (SRI), Regents data, SAT scores, student surveys 
and teacher feedback to determine the best course to take when implementing a mastery based learning and 
standards based assessment system. All eighth grade students were enrolled in Algebra and Living Environment. Our 
partnership with Queens College expanded to include Latin, Japanese, Environmental Science and Geology. The QSI 
seven year scope and sequence was also revised to reflect more rigorous standards and pre-requisites for high school 
and college courses. Rigorous classroom instruction along with elevated school-wide standards has led to increased 
Regents pass and college readiness rates and credits earned at the college. 

In 2017-18, we added SATs as a focus for college readiness. QSI faculty were trained by A-List, and we began offering 
SAT preparation classes both after school and on Saturdays. On average, students raised scores on their SATs by more 
than 150 points, and for the first time, at QSI, our average cohort score was above the district and State average.  

Additionally, the Queens School of Inquiry returned to its focus on inquiry based instruction. To do this, we placed 
greater emphasis on collaborative teachers and classroom practices aligned to the school's mission. The goal was to 
move toward interdisciplinary instruction and instructional units using an inquiry model. In 2018-19, eighth and tenth 
grade teachers offer Humanities courses, the Inquiry course is no longer a stand-alone course, but integrated into all 
subject area courses, QSI became a Facing History school, and we joined MSQI to focus on literacy development 
across grades and content areas.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Given a full transition to Mastery-Based Learning and Standards-Based Assessment, the expectation is every class 
prepares all of our students to be successful in college and graduate from a secondary learning institution within four 
years of matriculation. This means students must have an opportunity to engage in inquiry-based learning 
experiences and reflective writing and speaking that extends learning and engages students in higher order thinking. 
Our priority is to design highly engaging learning activities fully aligned to mastery-based learning targets and steeped 
in the inquiry model.  

 

Since 2012, when our first class graduated, students at the Queens School of Inquiry have consistently graduated at a 
pace of over 92%, far exceeding the City and State average. Additionally, 100% of graduates are accepted to a college 
of their choice, and more than 95% of graduates begin matriculating at a two or four year college/university 
immediately following graduation. Our students graduate college-ready, having taken college courses while in high 
school, and these successes benefit them far beyond high school.  

 

Our goal for 2018-19 is to enhance students' experiences with inquiry based learning, so as to increase their 
opportunities for problem solving and higher order thinking. We strongly believe this will lead to higher SAT and ACT 
scores and higher rates of admissions to top universities. We consistently seek ways to strengthen students 
competitively on a national and global scale.  

 

In Fall 2017, our 7-Year Scope and Sequence changed. Most notably, students took Regents English in 9th Grade. 
Eighty-six percent of ninth graders passed the English Regents in 2017-18. Forty-four percent earned a score of 85 or 
better. Starting in September 2018, these same students will take a Humanities course. The course will couple English 
and Global History studies and be aligned to the inquiry curriculum approach. We anticipate enrollment of our high 
school juniors in English 110 at CUNY Queens College will increase by 20% in Fall 2019. This means that by June 2018, 
more than 80% of this student cohort will have earned an 85 or better on the English Regents and a B or better in the 
Humanities course.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

The emphasis on writing and literacy skills will continue to reach down to the middle school and receive new 
attention in 2018-19. All eighth grade students will have the opportunity to take the US History Regents exam and a 
Humanities course. Our participation as both a Facing History and a Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI) school will 
turn our focus to literacy and inclusion, and help us insure all students are reading diverse texts on or above grade 
level by the time they reach high school.  

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, we will increase student performance in literacy. Through our partnership with MSQI and Facing History, 
and our pilot of Humanities in 8th and 10th grades, all middle school students will increase by two (2) lexile levels 
according to the Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) assessment, and 30% of SWDs in tenth grade will score above 85 on 
the English Regents, securing them a place in College English 110.

Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
- Power Schools, the online grading and reporting system, requires an annual contract and maintenance. Our website 
queensinquiry.com is necessary for posting all school-wide information and provides a grading platform and webpage 
for every teacher and course. NYSTL software and TL money are used to support this contract.  

- Administration will work to develop leadership capacity in key pedagogical staff to facilitate implementation of 
goals. At least 300 hours of per session will be devoted to meeting times and coverage for scheduled inter-visitations 
and consultations. Per session funding is aligned to multiple sources.  

- A consultant began working with key pedagogical staff in 2015-16 to practice inter-visitations aligned to Advance. In 
2018-19, the consultant will return to work with staff focusing specifically on curriculum development and alignment 
to goals. The consultant costs will be covered through TL FSF.  

- One ELA teacher's program will be devoted to coaching teachers and facilitating the development of inquiry aligned 
units and their implementation. In addition, the Humanities courses require a full time English and a full time history 
teacher present at all times, along with a dedicated Special Education teacher for the courses that require ICT 
support. Teacher salaries are covered by TL FSF and TL ASD Nest funds.  

- Some Monday professional development and weekly common planning periods will be used to work through the 
new literacy model  

- Contracts with A-List, DRP, and Castle Learning (adaptive computer-based test preparation tool) are all annualized. 
Contracts paid for with NYSTL software, TL FSF, ASD Nest and other funds.  

- HR: Two additional pedagogues are utilized as part-time coaches to support teacher development and college and 
career transitions for SE students. Salaries are split between TL FSF and TL ASD Nest funds.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
The Quality Review, Survey and Quality Report all indicate this is the school's greatest strength.  

 

Our most recent Quality Review stated: There is a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, 
families and students and effectively highlights goals connected to a path to college and career readiness. As a result, 
there is a sense of mutual accountability among the stakeholders. Parents play an active role in supporting students 
throughout the school. 

 

Overwhelmingly, parents, students and teachers indicate that there is a positive school culture and high expectations 
are communicated to students and staff. QSI had close to 1500 matches for incoming 9th grade students in 2018. This 
was to fill only 20 open seats. This is a consistent trend and a sign of our strength in this area.  

 

In 2016-17, the ASD Nest program which serves students on the Autism spectrum grew to include high school. Two 
student cohorts matriculated to 9th grade. Pass rates in course work was 100%. All ten students successfully moved 
to 10th grade, and a new cohort of three freshmen matriculate in 2017-18. Seven students in this sophomore cohort 
have met pre-requisites for college coursework, and a bridge program was been created for all students to help 
support transitions to high school and early college. In 2018-19, there will be five cohorts altogether in the high 
school, along with the existing three cohorts in the middle school. Two full time staff are devoted to supporting co-
teaching relationships that ultimately support better learning for all students and students' transitions between 
middle school, high school and college, respectively.  

 

Simultaneously, we consistently seek new ways to support a fully inclusive environment and support students social 
and emotional development. In 2017-18, this included expanding our GSA (Gay-Straight Alliance) to include a middle 
school cohort, joining Brain Power Learning, and expanding the Renzulli Enrichment Model. We also work closely with 
Facing History and Ourselves to offer staff development and curriculum support. In 2018-19, QSI is a full partner 
Facing History school.  

 

Overall, Queens School of Inquiry uses attendance rates and participation in school activities to determine the 
students' level of engagement. In 2017-18, our average attendance rate was 94.4%. Of 321 high school students, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          20 

 

more than 150 participated in SING!, eleven students travelled to Japan with Queens College in July 2018, close to 
seventy students participated in our expanded PSAL program, and GSA grew to over fifty members. This is only a 
sampling of the increased involvement of students in the school community. We strongly believe it is imperative the 
school maintain its culture and reputation for all students and remain an inclusive space that supports all learners.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June, 2019, the school culture and learning environment will more effectively support the academic and personal 
growth of each student, as evidenced by an 1% increase in students with over 90% attendance, from 94.4% to 95.4%.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In 2017-18, teachers engaged in a school-wide data analyses protocol. We used the Vertical Slice protocol to 
determine the extent to which curriculum was engaging and teachers communicate high expectations, allowing for 
higher order thinking and student led discussion in all areas of learning. Every pedagogue was given the opportunity 
to be a "student for the day." It was an opportunity to see school and learning through the students' eyes. Their 
findings included, but were not limited to: 

- Students need more time to explain their thinking and write about their learning experiences. 

- Much of the same learning style is used throughout the day leading some students to "feel bored" or "check-out." 

- Inquiry-based/project-based learning is happening in the middle school, yet there was still little evidence of it in the 
high school. 

- There were fewer than expected opportunities noted for students to apply critical thinking and discussion. 

 

As a result of the school-wide endeavor, teacher teams engaged in professional development and learning around 
Inquiry, problem-solving and ways to include movement and increase attention. Summarily, these learning 
opportunities lead to teachers developing goals that increase student engagement and enhance instruction in 
research and problem solving.  

 

Additionally, in 2016 up through Fall 2017, Queens School of Inquiry underwent a NYS Review of Special Education 
Practices. This audit reviewed all practices from IEP development to lesson construction and implementation. While 
this has always been an area of strength for the school community, special education and general education teachers 
had increased opportunities to collaborate during the process. We spent a great deal of the 2017-18 school year 
further developing these collaborative processes to support all students, particularly ICT practices for SE students.  

 

In 2017-18, Queens School of Inquiry teacher collaborations moved beyond ICT partnerships. The master schedule 
aligned the history and English courses, provided time for grade and content team members to meet and plan, and 
allowed time for math teachers to push-in to science classrooms. While, overall, positive responses about rigor and 
depth of curriculum increased considerably on the Learning Environment Survey, there remains one overwhelming 
disparity. More than 80% of teachers report believing their curriculum challenges students, while less than 50% of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          27 

 

student report feeling challenged. Raising the level of rigor and engagement will be the focus of this year's goal in 
hopes of closing this perception gap.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, all teachers will demonstrate improved practice in "Engagement," as defined by the Danielson Rubric, and 
earn a 0.21 overall average increase in the Domain 3, Component C score. This will move the average earned score from 
3.34 to 3.5.

deliver an inquiry/problem-solving based history unit. In 2018-
19, this will expand two-fold: 

- Students will be enrolled in Humanities in eighth and tenth 
grades. This means the English and History teachers at these 
grade levels will co-teach all classes throughout the day to 
deliver a cohesive curriculum that simultaneously supports 
history content and literacy development.  

- The Inquiry teacher will spend time with teachers across grades 
and content areas replicating the cross-curricular development 
and delivery model established in 2017-18.  

Teachers with less than three years' experience at the Queens 
School of Inquiry will engage is targeted professional 
development designed to help teachers align curriculum and 
pedagogical practices to the QSI mission and vision.  

- 36% of teachers (n=47) have been hired since 2015.  

- Additional support is required to acclimate new teacher to the 
school's early college mission and vision.  

- Teachers new to QSI will be supported in this work by 
administration and teachers who have been identified as coaches 
and team leaders.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
All curricular materials and course specific units and assessments are posted to each course's page and can be found 
at queensinquiry.com. Two PTA meetings (October and January) will focus on using and understanding 
queensinquiry.com.  

 

Moving to a one-to-one model will require parent training, as well as student and teacher training. Parents will have 
access to all curricular materials and student work at home via queensinquiry.com. Family orientation in August 
introduced protocols, as did Back to School Night in September. Additional meetings will be held on an as needed 
basis.

pay and per diem instructional coverage.  

- Three pedagogical staff members act as part-time coaches, and each department has chosen a leader to facilitate 
meetings and monitor accountability. They will be the primary contacts for the teachers as they pursue their 
collaborations. TL funds are used to support their positions and pay per session, as needed.  

- Consultants are paid for with TL funds. When the consultant is present, teachers are covered by peers or per diem 
instructors paid for with TL FSF and ASD Nest funds.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The Queens School of Inquiry is a successful school model as evidenced by a consistent graduation rate over 92% 
since its first graduating class in 2012. More than 90% of all graduating students immediately enroll in a two or four 
year institution, and self-reports by high school alumni indicate, overwhelmingly, students feel prepared for college 
upon matriculation.  

 

High school alumni regularly participate in school events and give back. More than 30% of professionals who 
participated in the 2018 Career Days were former QSI students. More than thirty alumni returned to represent their 
respective colleges in our 2017 student led college fair. All high school students participate in our early college 
program. One hundred percent of students who graduate have earned at least three college credits prior to 
graduation, including all ENLs and SWDs. School Leadership strongly believes these successes are due to strong 
academic cohesion from 6-12 aligned to our early college mission and a strong school culture that celebrates inclusion 
and engenders familial relationships among the student body and school staff.  

 

This year, these successes aligned to formal school data. Regents pass rates all hovered close to or above 90%, 
including eighth grade students who take both Algebra and Living Environment; students demonstrated greater 
proficiency in middle school ELA and math; and, our August 2018 graduation was 99%. On average, high school 
graduates accumulated more than 36 college credits from CUNY Queens College while in high school with average 
college GPAs above 2.7. So following, teachers' MOTP ratings in Advance reflect a 90% success rate, meaning 90% of 
earned ratings were effective or highly effective.  

 

Teacher collaboration and leadership is essential to this success. Yet, only 80% of teachers report that they have, 
influence over the development of curricular materials, according to our 2017-18 Quality Report. Additionally, only 
73% of teachers believe they have influence over the instructional materials used in the classroom. This indicates less 
than 80% of teachers see themselves as full partners in the development and delivery of mastery-based instruction 
and standards-based assessment.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32 

 

identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, school leaders will build teachers' capacity to design Inquiry based/problem-solving units that are 
mastery-based and aligned to standards as evidenced by a 15% increase in teachers' positive responses to questions 
about teacher influence in the 2018-19 Quality Report survey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Each year, surveys reveal parents have an overwhelming positive view of the school. Ninety-six percent of parents 
report feeling welcomed when they come to the building and 97% percent of parents feel that they and their children 
are respected by school faculty. In 2018, 67% of parents responded to the School Environment Survey; up from less 
than 40% in 2017.  

 

Parent engagement was at its highest rate in 2017-18. Parents supported, worked at and attended three full school 
performances - SING!, Elf the Musical and an international dance recital. Parents attended middle school field trips, 
performances during our Middle School College Immersion, science presentations, and sporting events. For Juniors 
and Seniors, almost 100% of families attended evenings devoted to the college choice and admissions process and 
filling out the FAFSA. School counselors also lead quarterly parent meetings for parents of children with ASD to 
support school-to-home connections. Finally, we celebrated students and families at our NHS Induction Ceremony, 
Senior Awards Night and Sports Award Night.  

 

In 2017-18, parents came together to create a Parents for the Arts group, and this group raised more than $6,000 to 
support the arts at QSI. In June 2019, QSI will graduate its first cohort of students receiving an Arts endorsed diploma.  

 

Additionally, QSI Career Days are a significant platform for engaging with New York professionals and the larger 
community. Professionals volunteer time to meet with small groups of students and share work they do. As our high 
school graduates complete college and move into the workforce, they are an integral part of this work and our 
connections to the larger community. Former students and current students' parents are a large part of the workforce 
represented at Career Days.  

 

The National Honor Society and other school-based service groups have also increased their community presence. 
Teams of students have participated in annual Autism Speaks, American Cancer Association and AIDS walks. These 
same students have raised money and awareness for select charities and organizations. In 2018-19, a group of 
students, through a partnership with JCRC, built a bridge between New York City teenagers and Arab and Israeli teens 
growing up in Jerusalem through a virtual cultural exchange. In the wake of the Parkland school shooting, NHS and 
others led our school's walk-out, a variety of enrichment events aimed at community organizing and social action, and 
more than thirty students, faculty and families participated in this year's March for Our Lives in NYC.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

 

Finally, for the first time, QSI joined forces with the Child Center of New York in 2018 and, in May 2018, we held a 
Community Health Fair. The fair was held in conjunction with the final parent night of 2017-18. More than 30 vendors 
participated, and close to 100% of QSI families participated alongside community members. We plan to make this an 
annual event and will kick off the 2018-19 school year with our second fair. This will be an opportunity for Brain 
Power Learning to recruit parents and community members for their parent group that will also begin in Fall 2018.

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

 

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS

In the event the status of any student changes, we work with the student and his/her family to determine the family's 
needs. The Parent Coordinator and/or Community Coordinator liaise with the family to insure the student has 
appropriate school supplies, clothing, food and transportation that allows for full participation and success in school. 

 

3. Some Non-Title I schools receive a specific allocation based on the reported number of students living in temporary 
housing.  If your school received an allocation (please refer to the current Title I Funds Summary of School Allocation 
Memorandum), include the amount your school received in this question.  If your school did not receive an allocation 
and needs assistance in identifying resources to assist STH students, please contact an STH liaison.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Queens School of Inquiry , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A 
of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

[School name] will support parents and families of Title I students by:

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The assessments used in our school are the NYSITELL, and task performances in content areas. We use NYSITELL as well as 
authentic materials as baseline assessments for incoming students, and  writing samples in their native languages, and exit 
slips. The data helps with student placement, in making instructional decisions. In addition, the data helps to inform 
differentiation and scaffolding practices in core classes.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We disseminate information weekly through grade team meeting, ENL teacher planning meetings, and core content teacher 
meetings. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

Summative assessments and baseline assessments we use at this time are: end of unit assessments, regents exams, ELA 
and  Math state tests, the NYSESLAT, Scholastic Reading Inventory Reading Program. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

After all data is  reviewed teachers collaboratively  discuss what the students strengths and area of improvement needs are. 
Teachers have allotted times in their schedules for student intervention.  Then the students are serviced according to their 
needs in the block periods.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
As per our school structure (6-12) we provide Academic Intervention Services (AIS) for students who been identified based on 
data in need of extra support. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
After analyzing data on the RLAT by modality listening, speaking, reading, and writing) we discuss how to best support our 
students language acquisition by scaffolding the lesson plan to meet the students language needs. In addition, after analyzing 
each modality we discussed with the content teaching staff which modality needs the most support and which modality may 
need enrichment. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The data specialist meets with administration, and a team of teachers to analyze and discuss data. Given that it is a small 
population of ELLs this is the structure we have set forth. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instructional minutes are delivered  through integrated content area and ENL services simultaneously. The ELLs are 
placed in the same classes by grade as the rest of the school population. They're 
grouped  in heterogeneous  proficiency levels and they travel as a cohort from class to class. The students are pulled-
out by the ENL teacher to provide one-to-one instruction for learning reinforcement, and extended time during 
testing.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

In order to ensure that ELLs receive their full mandated unit of ENL and content area Instruction, our school strategically 
programs students schedule so that the ENL teacher time is maximized in the classroom, and engaged in student instruction.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   All 28 students at QSI are enrolled in the Free Standing ENL program.  Common Core Language Standards and College 
Readiness Standards are implemented in all classes. All content is delivered in English and students are expected to use English 
in all classes with native language support materials, when possible. Student are in a supportive environment that share high 
expectations in performance aligned common core and college readiness goals. Multiple instructional strategies are used  to 
assist students in meeting the standards. To make content more comprehensible the students are supported with instructional 
tools and scaffolds. For example, in order to for the students to meet the standards we provide strategic group work, explicit 
vocabulary teaching, modeling, audiovisuals, graphic organizers, individual dry erase boards and I Pad's as translators . 
 
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

All students are given periodic assessments throughout the year, and when needed students' native languages are used during 
writing prompts. If an ENL student is in the early stages of language acquisition, the ENL teacher works collaboratively with the 
content area teacher to ensure that writing assignment, oral responses, and class work is translated in the students' native 
language.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. The SIFE students receive services from the ENL teacher daily which includes their mandated minutes per week. In addition 
they receive intensive literacy support, increase sheltered instruction, native language support, and introduction to basic skills 
and school activities, and community resources for their families. Differentiation instruction may include but it's not limited to, 
visuals of vocabulary, collaborative learning activities, hands-on learning, phonics, labeling the classroom, and role-playing, 
and modeling. 
b. The Newcomer has stand-alone instruction as well as integrated instruction. Based on their NYSITELL scores  differentiation 
may include teaching explicit vocabulary,audio and visual supports, listening skills, pre-reading exercises, graphic organizers, a 
bilingual dictionary, and phonics instruction. 
c. The developing ELLs continue to practice multiple learning opportunities to reinforce key concepts and vocabulary. Provide 
background knowledge across content curriculum with continued native support. Differentiation can include delivering the 
content in  "chunks"  so they can continue building academic knowledge and reinforce language acquisition. In addition, all 
lessons also have a language objective in all content areas. 
d. Differentiation instruction for long term ELLs may focus on intensive literacy development across curriculum, academic 
vocabulary development, study skills, metacognitive, and learning strategies. 
e. Former ELLs receive 90 minutes of support a week which include testing accommodations, and translated support materials, 
with continued literacy support. 
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The instructional strategies are provided according to the IEP and discussed with the students' IEP manger. The instructional 
strategies and grade-level materials used to access content are: graphic organizers, questions are read aloud, audible literacy 
books with adaptations, and technology. To accelerate the English language development dictionaries and bilingual glossaries 
are made accessible to the student. Lessons are planned with students' language proficiency level in mind.  In addition, flexible 
grouping is provided, that provide opportunities for social, linguistic, academic development. Also, a variety of assessments are 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

given that permit the student to display learning through different modalities of strength (oral, written, kinesthetic and 
auditory). 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The ELLS with disabilities are allotted time in their schedule for one-to-one target intervention,  separate location for extra 
testing time, and to work on project-base activities. The students are in general integrated classrooms with an ENL teacher, 
a support teacher, and the students IEP teacher along with the classroom content teacher to ensure their goals are met in the 
least restrictive environment. In determining the students' IEP and ENL needs, the student and staff schedules are aligned to 
make co-planning and push-in possible. A program is put in place to accommodate all parties. This helps to support a 
full inclusion program without pull-out services. The ENL and IEP teachers have scheduled co-planning time with general 
education staff, grade level teams and departments.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
In our school we have intervention periods during the school day for ELLs  who are struggling in ELA, Math, Science and History 
which include small group support. Instruction that is taught in the classroom is reinforced and reviewed during this class 
period.  The interventions target the core areas students are struggling with. Targeted support is also given in non-core 
classes  3 times a week for all students who scored below a 3 in the ELA and Math State Exams. The ENL teacher provides 
additional assistance during her office hours for Entering, Emerging and Transitioning ELLs. 
 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Language Apps on the I pad are used for Entering and Emerging ELLs as well as SIFE and long term ELLs. 
High School ELL student's receive additional help in English class during Socratic Seminar which targets listening, speaking and 
reading. As part of the balanced literacy program, ELLs engage in shared, guided and independent reading and writing, and 
when appropriate parallel native language texts are purchased.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
School Programs are all inclusive with flexibility of time and dates to accommodate all ELL students. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The ENL teacher uses I Pad apps to help support word for word translations and visual supports to improve language 
acquisition. In addition, I Pads are available for home lending to support language acquisition to families outside the school 
day. Furthermore, classroom teachers use smart board technology, books on tape, graphic organizers and visual word walls. 
The ENL teacher pre teaches and front loads vocabulary, modifies lessons for Entering and Emerging ELLs. Castle Learning is an 
online study guide and assessment that prepares the students for science, math and English Regents. The ENL teacher uses the 
I Pad to record students' stories and track progress in speaking and listening and students use it to prepare for presentations. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Our program is a free standing ENL program and all 28 students are enrolled in the program. All content is taught in English 
using ENL methodology and native language support. The native language is delivered through books, dictionaries, glossaries, 
portable translators or native language teacher/student translation. Newcomers and beginners can respond to literature in 
their native language. Test can be ordered in the student's native language.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

Books/materials are both grade and age appropriate, as well as the content support that the student is receiving. The 
syllabus for every course has gone through an extensive accreditation process to ensure that all instructional materials in all 
content areas at all grade levels are age appropriate and aligned to CCLS.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Schedules schedules are aligned to accommodate the shared spaces, so that the shared gym, auditorium, and lunchroom is 
used by one school at a time. ELLs use these facilities at their scheduled times.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
All students participate in orientation. This is organized by MS and HS counselors, parent coordinator, Community Coordinator, 
Assistant principal and Principal. When a new ENL student arrives they are matched with a grade peer who helps them 
navigate the school environment. Whenever possible a native speaker is chosen.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Middle school students are offered Spanish. High school students are offered Spanish and French. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The ENL teachers are given time to participate in UFT/ DOE sponsored online webinars and workshops. In addition, they are 
encouraged to seek out any PD of interest that would add to their practice. In addition, the ENL teachers are currently 
attended the Socratic Seminar for ELLs, and will be attending the SIFE seminar workshop for ELLs in the future.  
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The ENL teachers are given time to participate in UFT/ DOE sponsored online Webinar and workshops. One of the ENL teachers 
is CTLE certified and will be providing PD to our staff in order for them to fulfill their 15% CTLE hours as per CR part 154.2. An 
attendance sheet will be provided for signing in and out of PD.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL teacher uses parent contact time every Tuesday to reach out to ENL parents to discuss progress and areas of concern, 
as well as having meetings with parents during their prep periods. We plan on holding parent workshops. Translators are used 
as needed.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

ELL parents are encouraged to be part of the Queens School of Inquiry family and participate in PTA, school activities, such 
as sports/clubs and PTA sponsored events like the International Dinner.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Meredith Inbal, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In order for QSI to assess written and oral interpretations, data is collected from the Home Language Survey, 
Emergency Blue Cards, parent orientations and open house events.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language
