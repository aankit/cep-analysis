Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Public School 130’s Mission Statement 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Our mission in cooperation with family and community’s to “Make a Difference” by preparing students to be 
responsible, functional, and independent members of society. A safe positive learning environment is provided in 
order to foster excellence in all areas through our positive mindset. To collaborate with parents and local community

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 130, the Abram Stevens Hewitt School is an elementary school with 436 students from Pre K through 5th grade. 
The school population consists of 73% Hispanic, 23% African American, 2% White, and 1% (American Indian/Alaskan 
Native, Asian or White). The student body includes 19% English Language Learners of which 14% are new to the 
United States, and 26% students with disabilities (SWD). The current average attendance rate for the school is 91% 
during the 2018-2019 school year.  

 

P.S. 130 has a large Hispanic population (73%) of which 2 3% are second language learners and/or new to the country. 
To support the learning of these new immigrants and English Language Learners (ELLs), We have created self-
contained English as a New Language (ENL) classes in grades K-5 with a licensed and/or certified ENL teacher in each 
class. We also have a push-in/pull-out model for students that are not placed in those stand alone ENL classes.  

 

We believe all students can learn, achieve, and meet high standards of excellence regardless of their learning needs. 
The school community and the home work together to strive for high standards of excellence. 

Our vision is to motivate and enable all scholars to accomplish their highest educational goals. All stakeholders 
working together to nurture & support academic social-emotional well-being of all students, so they are engaged and 
become lifelong learners.

At PS 130, 22% of student body are ELLS and 26% are students with disabilities. Among these two subgroups, 14% are 
both ELL and SWD. This special student population has a variety of needs and require special attention. The specific 
needs include: 

small group instruction 
scaffolded resources, tasks, instruction 

  differentiation  
 
 
  use of multi-media 
 
 

supportive classroom environment

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

School Strengths and Accomplishments  

As stated in the 2016-2017 Quality Review, the school maintains a supportive and positive learning environment that 
conveys high expectations to students and parents. The implementation of the growth mindset theory of action has 
resulted in a safe environment and inclusive culture that supports progress toward the school's goals.  

 

The school implemented a school-wide Thinking Maps Program in grades K-5. All pedagogues, some 
paraprofessionals, parents and support staff were provided with professional development in the Tier 1 Thinking 
Maps initiative. By using and encouraging the use of Thinking Maps, students were taught how to show their thinking 
on appropriate maps. As a result of the professional learning, we now have 7 Trainer of Teachers (Cohort 1 and 2) on 
staff to support the use and implementation of Thinking Maps. Parents were introduced to Thinking Maps during 
Touring Tuesdays and have used them as a tool during PTA meetings.  

 

The school also implemented a school wide SOLVE problem solving strategy in mathematics. All teachers supported 
with professional development and in-class support in the use of SOLVE in grades K-5. The school is utilizing the Lucy 
Calkins writing program as part of the superintendent's initiative. One teacher on every grade, received professional 
development on the writing program at Teacher's College.  

 

Key areas of focus for the 2018-2019 school year: 

 

  English Language Acquisition (a language objective is to be included in lessons); emphasizing speaking and 

listening for critical discourse (K-5) 

SOLVE math problem solving strategy (K-5) 

  Writing in at least 4 different genres (narrative, information, argument/opinion, poetry) (K-5) 
 
  Differentiation of instruction and small group instruction 
  Targeting needs of students with disabilities to maximize their progress and performance 
  delivering targeted, high quality instruction that is rigorous and cognitively engages all learners across all 

content areas 

  maximize the resources and supports provided to teachers as well as the opportunities for teachers to 

collaborate on teams to impact their practice and student achievement.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

  a positive school-wide culture that celebrate learning and ensures that the social-emotional needs of every 

student are met to enable them to meet high academic expectations.  

 

 

Challenges  

Within our diverse, lower economic school community with a high percentage of second language learners, we are 
able to improve student progress in both literacy and math, however, we struggle to advance student’s 
performance levels on standardized assessments.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

PS 130's strength is the ability to help students demonstrate progress in literacy and math. Students' priority for 
improvement is to raise the overall academic performance and progress of all students. Comprehension is a necessary 
strategy in all subject areas and all grade levels. There is a need to align teacher's content knowledge that will support 
students' literacy skills and improve student reading comprehension. The implementation of rigorous instruction is 
also needed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

  By June 2019, there will be a 5% increase in average student score in ELA, as measured by NYS ELA Assessment. 
By strategically grouping students to build their foundational reading and writing skills there will be a decrease 
the number of Level 1s and increase the number of Level 3s on the NYS ELA exam.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
As noted in the PS 130 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, the school has structures that address personal attention and 
support (90% positive response), as well as support in social emotional learning (90% positive response). In addition, 
the 2016-2017 Quality Review identified structures which support the school’s high expectations, build buy-in and 
accountability among staff, students and their families, thus providing a clear path towards increased student 
achievement and college and career readiness.  

However, the survey indicates that classroom behaviors need to be addressed (78% positive response).  

 

The school has brought the focus back to classroom behavior with the a more thorough implementation of PBIS in 
grades K-5.  

The school's approach is rooted in the belief of having a growth mindset. Each student can be guided to become a 
reflective thinker and independent learner. The school principal purchased a book about having a growth mindset and 
as a results the school staff became shareholders of this belief. All staff members are now stake holders in this belief 
system about perceptions of life. To celebrate students who demonstrate having a growth mindset staff members 
share anecdotes that are read weekly during morning announcements. School staff have tied together the earning of 
Star Bucks into having a growth mindset. Staff members want to share behaviors that personify being a team 
member, being accountable both in academics as well as behavioral, and being respectful in all their everyday actions. 

 

 

Strengths 

As outlined on the 2016-2017 Quality Review Rubric, 1.4 and 3.4 are the statements which reflect a well-developed 
practice. 

  The school's approach to culture building, discipline, and social-emotional support has structures in place and 

is informed by a growth mindset theory of action. 

  The implementation of the growth mindset theory of action results in a safe environment and inclusive 

culture that support progress toward the school's goals, and the school meaningfully involves student voice. 

  Each student is known well by at least one adult. 
 

School leaders consistently communicate high expectations to the entire staff and provide them with training 
to achieve such.

  Expectation's to the entire staff and provide them with training to achieve such expectations connected to a 
path of college and career readiness are communicated by the staff and school leaders as they partner with 
parents. 
Staff and families are a part of a culture of mutual accountability that supports student progress towards high 
expectations. 

 

Areas to Address 

The 2018-2019 Quality Guide indicates that the following areas are of concern: 

  74% of teachers say that students listen carefully when the teacher gives directions 
  71% of teachers say that students behave well in class even when the teacher isn't watching 
  80% of teachers say that students follow the rules in class 

 

As outlined on the 2016-2017 Quality Review Rubric, 1.1, 1.2, 2.2, and 5.1 are areas to be addressed over the 
following year. 

  Members of the school community will maintain across classrooms, teaching strategies that will continue to 

be aligned to the curricula and continue to reflect a set of beliefs about how students learn best. Lessons that 
are aligned to the Danielson Framework for Learning. Schools staff will continue to design lessons that have 
multiple entry points that can be accessible in meeting all student needs. 

  Members of the school community will continue to work on producing meaningful work products in the 

classrooms and continue to provide a meaningful lessons that engage and creates a high level thinkers 
throughout the school. 

  Members of the school community will maintain across all grades a need for curricula based and academic 

tasks that emphasize rigorous habits and higher-order skills. 

  The school is developing their use of common assessments to measure student progress toward goals across 

grades and subject areas.

-Teachers develops lessons that include the integration of the 
four language modalities (speaking, listening, reading and 
writing), appropriate scaffolds, and differentiation resulting in 
authentic and meaningful language tasks 

-Informational/instructional charts facilitate student learning by 
providing strategies that students can easily use on their own. 

- Teachers ensure appropriate scaffolds (wait time and home 
language support); students assume responsibility for high 
quality by initiating improvements, making revisions, adding 
details, and/or assisting peers in their precise use of language  

-Implementation of Carnival of Cultures (clear evidence that the 
ENL/Bilingual/DL teacher ensures that student behavior is 
entirely appropriate while demonstrating sensitivity to students' 
cultural differences. Students take an active role in monitoring 
their own behavior and/or that he other students against 
standards of conduct which are made available in their home 
languages when possible. ENL/Bilingual/DL Teacher monitoring 
of student behaviour is subtle and preventive. The teacher's 
response to student misbehavior is sensitive to individual student 
needs and culture while respecting students' dignity. 

-Scaffolding and connecting with students' interests. 

-Teacher's spoken and written language is expressive and teacher 
finds opportunities to extend student's vocabularies, both within 
the discipline and for more general use, and is appropriate to the 
student's proficiency level.

Areas of Need: 

  Teachers need to analyze data to better provide delivery of targeted, rigorous instruction  
  Teachers need to use higher order thinking (HOTS) questioning and discussion techniques 
  Teachers need to incorporate inferencing opportunities for students  
  Teachers need to plan according to the expectations of the Danielson model based on accurate and current 

data 

The school leader has created an internal leadership team of teachers that receives ongoing support and training that 
nurtures professional growth that in turn has an impact of student achievement.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Academic and personal goals are a part of the Department of Education Citywide Instructional Expectations. At school 
meetings the school staff and parents association come together and discuss what the school can do to help students 
succeed.  

 

A review of the PTA sign-in sheets for the 2017-2018 school year show that there was an average of ____ parents per 
month attending the PTA meetings. 

 

Strengths: 

Based on the 2016-2017 Learning Environment Survey, 95% of our parents agreed and strongly agreed that the school 
encourages them to participate in the child's education. 95% of our parents agreed and strongly agreed that the 
school staff regularly communicates with them on ways to help their children learn. 98% of the parents feel they are 
respected and supported by their child's teachers. 

 

Touring Tuesdays began with only 5 parents participating in the experience and completed the cycle with more than 
30 parents attending this event. Consistent parent outreach is needed as a reminder for parents to attend any and all 
school-wide events. 

Weakness: 

  Based on the 2016-17 Learning Environment Survey ,63% of parents/guardians responded that, since the 

beginning of the school year, they have been asked or had the opportunity to volunteer time to support their 
school.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 130 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 130 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

At PS 130X, our overriding  goal is to maintain high expectations for our ELLs. In fact, we strive 
to provide them with quality instruction.  With this in mind, we have designed a rigorous and 
intensive morning and ENL after school program  targeting ELLs, based on their performance on 
the 2018 NYSESLAT. The targeted group for the ENL after school program includes English 
language learners from grades 3-5. The morning  program will provide ENL instruction for 
ELLs in grades K-2. Both the morning and afterschool programs  will run from November 
5,  2018 until January 17,  2019. In addition,  our newcomers will be invited  to the morning 
and  after school programs. The programs will address the instructional needs of our ELLs  in 
literacy. In order to make content comprehensible, the teachers will use scaffolding strategies to 
facilitate student learning. These strategies will be implemented across our programs to promote 
academic growth for ELL students.  
                
The ENL morning program will be held on  Wednesdays and Thursdays from 7:05 AM-8:05 AM 
and the afterschool program will take place on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:40 PM-4:40 
PM. The objective of the ENL morning and  after school program is to help students acquire and 
develop reading comprehension and writing skills. Also, the morning and  after school programs 
will focus on helping English Language learners become successful readers and writers. Students 
will be exposed to higher order thinking questions, language structure, academic language, and 
reading strategies.  In addition, students will learn how to use thinking maps to organize their 
writing and to further develop short response paragraphs and extended response essay writing.  
The following key focus skills for Kindergarten students that will be addressed: 
* Identifying letters and sounds 
* Producing letters 
* Sequencing letters to produce grade-level words 
* Drawing and writing about a topic using a prompt 
 
The language of instruction is English and the instruction will be provided by a certified 
bilingual teacher and four certified ENL teachers. Based on our current EDAT, many of our 
students need additional support in reading and writing. These students  will receive targeted 
instruction during the after school program to meet their individual needs.  
 
The materials used for the Title III ENL morning program are as follows:  
1.  Finish Line for ELLs : English Proficiency Practice 
2. Time for Kids for ELLs 
3. Imagine Learning 
 
 
Our English Language Learners need to build English-language proficiency  with highly 
differentiated and rich instruction.  With Finish Line for ELLs and Time for Kids,  each 
lesson provides rigorous instruction in the four modalities: speaking, listening, reading, and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60

writing. There are  35 lessons with a range of reading levels and a variety of high-interest topics 
to engage students.  Finish Line for ELLs has a range of text types and genres that leads to a 
natural progression in language and learning opportunities.  Each lesson focuses on a specific 
standard and a content topic connected with it. The lessons emphasize  the following skills: 
1) Conversational Language 
2) The language of Academic Mathematics 
3) The language of Academic Language Arts 
4) The language of Academic Science 
5) The language of Academic Social Studies 
Assessments are administered before and after instruction to drive instructional decisions. 
Moreover, the materials will  help students improve their vocabulary and grammar usage .  Using 
current integrated units of study (content driven), we will create theme based units to help enrich 
students' vocabulary. Students will be writing in journals  while learning and applying Tier 2 and 
Tier 3 words.  Also, technology (Imagine Learning) will be a source of comprehensible input and 
provide a source of sound, pictures, video, animation, and multimedia that can help stimulate 
learning with a meaningful context.  The students will learn how to speak in complete and 
elaborate sentences,  write coherent sentences, write clear, well-developed paragraphs.  In 
addition, we will purchase Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT from Attanasio and Associates to 
provide quality instruction to our ELLs with a focus on the four modalities: speaking, listening, 
reading, and writing. Growth in students will be measured by their performance on the 
2019 NYSESLAT, TC Units of Study, and Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System.

Rationale: 
The primary focus of professional development(PD) is to assist teachers in enhancing their 
strategies and methods in helping ELLs  achieve  English language Proficiency.Teachers  will 
have an opportunity to choose various programs of interest that are  offered through the Network, 
the NYC Department of Education, as well as outside vendors. School based PD will be 
provided by administration and the instructional coach.The PDs will be centered around the 
Bilingual CCLS, and the CCLS, in alignment with the Danielson Framework . The focus will be 
the eight targeted competencies in the Danielson Framework for Teaching and Domains 1 and 4 
in the Framework for Teaching during a professional development session. The goal is to re-
familiarize  teachers with the components for ELL instruction.  There will also be ongoing 
dialogue between the teachers to provide continuous support to ELL students as they work to 
achieve English language proficiency, so that the content can be aligned with students across the 
grades. 
 
The ENL teachers will conduct ENL training during faculty and grade conferences. We have 
developed  an ELL professional library where teachers can borrow books/literature on the 
learning issues of English Language Learners. The titles  will include: Authentic Assessment for 
ELLs, The CALLA Handbook, Mirror of Languages, How to Teach ELLs, Principles of

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
To assess the early literacy skills of all our students, K-5, our school uses the Fountas and Pinnell program. It is used to 
determine baseline reading levels as well as monitor ongoing progress.  A baseline writing assessment is also used to 
determine the students' basic writing skills. In addition, the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL  results are also utilized to specifically 
assess ELLs; in fact, they present a broad view of students' performance in the four spectrums of Reading, Writing, Listening 
and Speaking. 
We have observed that using a range of assessment programs helps us determine specifically, our students’ areas of need and 
strength. Thus, we don’t use the assessments in isolation, but compare/contrast and integrate the results of the different 
assessment programs to help give us a clearer picture of where the students are exactly, in terms of literacy skills. This helps to 
inform our instructional plan. Having studied the results of the data from the aforementioned assessments, we have 
determined the following: in the areas of Listening and Speaking, our students are performing at the Entering, Emerging, 
Transitioning, and Expanding levels of proficiency; while in the areas of Reading and Writing they are mostly Entering, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

 

Emerging, and Transitioning and very few are Expanding . The results of the data help inform our instructional plan and 
prescribes the need for a strong balanced literacy program.  
 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We have put in place the following structures to support this effort: Professional development for teachers given  within the 
school and district, Teachers College Thinking Maps, classroom inter visitations, formal and informal observations 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At PS 130x, we use the NYC Performance Tasks to identify baseline, progress, and areas of need. The school engages in 
progressive data collection throughout the year using assessments aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards.  In the 
area of English Language Arts, we  administer the NYC performance Tasks twice during the school year; once in the fall and 
once in the spring. We review the student performance from the fall MOSL to identify areas of weaknesses and strengths in 
order  to make instructional decisions.  In the spring, the NYC Performance Task is administered once more to measure 
student progress. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

After school and morning enrichment programs,  Saturday Academy , LeAp Enrichment , RTI, Power Time (daily small group 
instruction embedded in every  classroom schedule). Monthly data meetings with ENL teachers on each grade level to 
plan  next steps using current data to drive instruction for English language learners. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
At PS 130x, we use data strategically to monitor student progress and identify areas of needs.  If students are performing 
below or far below grade level during any time of the standard reading and writing assessment periods, they are additionally 
assessed to further identify, track, and remediate deficiencies in reading and writing.  ELLs in our self-contained classes are 
closely monitored and receive added support as needed in small groups, by an additional ENL teacher or a certified bilingual 
teacher.  Before deciding on a course of action, we take  the following factors into consideration: 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data from the 2017 NYSESLAT  reveal that in the areas of Listening and Speaking, our students are performing at 
the Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding levels of proficiency; while in the areas of Reading and Writing they are Entering, 
Emerging, and Transitioning and few are expanding. Only two students scored at the commanding level. In the second and 
third grades, several students remained at the same proficiency level for two consecutive years. We also found that several 
students regressed by at least one proficiency level across the grades. This helps inform our instructional plan and prescribes 
the need for a strong balanced literacy program. We are supporting our ELLS using targeted guided reading and writing 
resources to enhance their literacy skills. Additionally, our ELLs are invited to be part of our After School Program as well as our 
Saturday Academy.  The focus of all of these programs is predominantly to develop our ELLs' reading and writing skills.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Monthly grade meetings with the ENL and classroom teachers to look at current data , analysis of student work, monthly data 
from Datacation, teacher made assessments, PBAs, etc.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The students who are functioning at the entering and emerging proficiency level receive 1 unit of standalone 
instruction to develop English language skills so that the students can succeed in the core content areas. We use the 
push-in model to implement integrated ENL. The ENL teachers work in collaboration with the classroom teachers to 
plan lessons. In addition,  the ENL teachers use effective research-based ENL strategies to make content 
comprehensible for the students. These strategies increase comprehension, learning, and interaction through 
modeling, acting out, gesturing, showing diagrams, and doing hands-on activities and experiments.  Moreover, the 
ENL teachers and the classroom teachers have opted to use a parallel  co-teaching approach to  deliver ENL 
instruction in some classes. For example, the classroom teacher teaches the non- ELLs in one group while the ENL 
teacher provide instruction to the ELLs in another group. The co-teaching models rotate throughout the week 
depending on the needs of the students. For instance, some classes may require different co-teaching models such 
as  one teach, one assess, two teach the same content, or one teacher leads, one "teaches on purpose." The students 
from grades K-5 are grouped heterogeneously based on their proficiency levels. For instance, fourth and fifth grades, 
the students performing at the Transitioning and Expanding level of proficiency are grouped together to receive 180 
minutes a week of  ENL instruction. Our students who are performing at the Entering and Emerging level of 
proficiency are grouped in the same class to receive 360 minutes a week of ENL instruction.  Furthermore, the 
students who have tested out of ENL in the past two years are grouped homogeneously to receive 90 minutes on 
Integrated ENL services weekly.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

At PS 130, we currently have 115 ELLs. They are divided into groups  and they are serviced by one program model: 
freestanding ENL. 
 
In the Integrated ENL Program (K-5th Grade) instruction is delivered according to the mandated number of instructional 
minutes. Students receive: 
Entering =2 units of integrated and standalone  ENL (360 minutes) per week 
Emerging =2 units of integrated and standalone ENL (360 minutes) per week. 
Transitioning=1 unit of integrated  ENL (180 minutes) per week. 
Expanding= 1 unit of integrated ENL (180 minutes) per week. 
Commanding=  .5 unit of integrated ENL (90 minutes) per week. 
 
 
Free-Standing Integrated and standalone  ENL Model : 
At PS 130x, we work on a 50 minute block of instruction. ELLs performing at the Entering and Emerging levels of proficiency 
are serviced for a period of 100 minutes per day/4 days a week with a total of 400 minutes per week, while students 
performing at the Transitioning and Expanding  levels of proficiency are serviced for 50 minutes per day/4 days a week with a 
total of 200 minutes per week. We are surpassing the mandated daily minutes of ENL instruction to our ELL population. Using 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

ENL methodology and strategies, we address the four modalities of language acquisition: Listening, Speaking, Reading and 
Writing. Scaffolding is also provided to ensure that content is comprehensible and learning takes place.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
At PS 130, we only offer Freestanding ENL.  However, we hope that the mandated number of parents request a bilingual class 
so that we can  open bilingual classes in the near future. The language of instruction in our Freestanding ENL program is 
English. 
Using ENL methodology and strategies, we address the four modalities of language acquisition; Listening, Speaking, Reading 
and Writing. Scaffolding is also provided to ensure that content is comprehensible and learning takes place. In recognition of 
varying skills, language proficiency and learning styles, we differentiate instruction for our ELLs. Different instructional 
strategies are modified for our ELLs including: Direct Instruction; Inquiry-Based Learning; Cooperative Learning; Information 
Processing, and the Teachers' College Reading and Writing Project  to foster literacy independence. 
In order to make content comprehensible, the teachers will use scaffolding strategies to facilitate student learning.  Growth in 
students will be measured by their performance on the 2017  NYSESLAT and the 
Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System. 
              We have been using Fundations, a program designed to help students who are struggling with reading, spelling, and 
writing.  The language of instruction for the newcomers will be English. However, teachers will use interpretation devices such 
as Google Translate to support instruction with the home language. Since most of our newcomers are native Spanish speakers, 
the ENL teachers who are also fluent in Spanish will use the students’ native language when necessary to reinforce the 
acquisition of the new language (English).  Additionally, The Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT from Attanasio and Associates will 
be purchased and used by our teaching staff who will provide quality instruction to our ELLs with a focus on the four 
modalities of language acquisition: listening, speaking, reading, and writing.  
 
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Since we do not offer transitional bilingual classes or dual language classes at our school, we do not have a system in place to 
evaluate ELLs in their home languages 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 5a. We differentiate instruction for SIFE students by  providing Supplementary support using the following strategies: 
5b. We differentiate instruction for our newcomers by focusing  on quality instruction using ENL methodology and strategies 
to improve reading and writing.  In effect, we  cover all content areas ensuring an alignment with the Common Core Standards. 
In regards to our instructional plan, we implement a four-pronged approach in an effort to address the four modalities of 
language acquisition; Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing. ENL methodology is used to make content comprehensible, 
including phonics instruction, sight vocabulary, as well as teaching content-specific vocabulary. We also use the Total Physical 
Response approach as well as modeling during instruction to enhance comprehension. To top it off, visuals are also displayed 
on the classroom walls to foster language acquisition. To further reading goals, Guided Reading (leveled readers) is integrated 
into our program. Audio-visual technology is also utilized, in building/enhancing grade level appropriate skills that students 
may be lacking. 
 
5c. Supplementary support is provided in small groups using differentiated instruction for our developing ELLs.  In addition, to 
differentiate instruction the ENL teachers use curriculum focused on content to allow students to learn  key information 
without getting confused and frustrated with the “fluff” the teachers deliver the content in “chunks” so that the students can

digest the information a little at a time;  Also, the teachers provide background knowledge, sometimes with native language 
support, to allow ELLs to tie new information to something familiar. Finally, the teachers define key vocabulary, multiple-
meaning words, and figurative language to make content comprehensible for the developing ELLs. 
 
5d. Supplementary support is provided in small groups using differentiated instruction for our  long-term ELLs.  In order to 
differentiate instruction for our former ELLs: students are grouped into three proficiency levels; Entering, Emerging, 
Transitioning and Expanding. Implementing a four-pronged approach, we address the four modalities of language acquisition; 
Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing. Scaffolding is also provided to ensure that content is comprehensible and learning 
takes place. In recognition of varying skills, language proficiency and learning styles, we modify and implement different 
instructional strategies for our ELLs including: Direct Instruction; Inquiry-Based Learning; Cooperative Learning; and 
Information Processing. We also differentiate instruction using small groups and through independent activities.  
 
5e. The ENL teachers will provide 90 minutes of integrated ENL instruction per week  to former ELLs who have tested out in 
the last 2 years. In order to differentiate instruction for our former ELLs, students are grouped homogeneously. Using tiered 
activities, all the learners work with the same important understandings and skills, but proceed with different levels of 
support, challenge, or complexity. Scaffolding is also provided to ensure that content is comprehensible and learning takes 
place. In recognition of varying skills, language proficiency and learning styles, we modify and implement different 
instructional strategies for our ELLs including: designing lessons based on students' learning styles; grouping students by 
shared interest, topic, or ability to complete assignments, assess students' learning using formative assessment, managing the 
classroom to create a safe and supportive environment, and  continually assess lesson content to meet students' needs. We 
also differentiate instruction using small groups and through independent activities. The former ELLs will also be invited to 
attend the After School  and Title III Saturday Academy Programs. 
 
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
To provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development, teachers use various ENL 
strategies which include scaffolding, use of graphic organizers, visuals, glossaries, laptops for reading and writing. This is in 
addition to the traditional strategies used to teach  ELLs and special education students. To meet the diverse needs of ELL-
SWDs, the teachers make sure that the students receive modified instruction tailored to meet their IEP goals through the 
Teachers' College Reading and Writing project, Fundations, Go Math, and Passport to Social Studies.  ELLs with special needs 
are assessed based on the annual goals and  testing accommodations stated on their IEPs. In addition, ELLs with special needs 
are given specific, direct and intensive remedial instruction. In fact, the lessons are specific, directed, and intensive remedial 
instruction designed to help the students meet their annual goals. ELLs identified as having special needs are given modified 
instruction and assessed based on their IEP goals and testing modifications.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
A concerted effort is made  to prepare ELL-SWDs for success in the least restrictive environment.   Content area teachers are 
provided with content materials which support all student learning by providing rigorous curriculum as is mandated by 
CCLS.  Classes are scheduled to go into the computer lab or have laptops and iPads brought to the classroom for accessing 
online content.  Accommodations are made by teachers to ensure maximum benefit of the instructional time in the 
class.   Also, Teachers work collaboratively to plan a coherent curriculum across the grades. Moreover, teachers are provided 
with double preparation time weekly to analyze the students' data. Teachers group students based on their academic needs by 
targeting and accommodating their learning styles.  Students in need of more tactile activity are grouped accordingly. Teachers 
also use the guided reading and guided math approach within the ELA and math block.     
 
 
ELL students who have IEPs are served with the full range of interventions available at the school. They are placed in small 
group guided reading, both within their classrooms, and receive stand-alone ENL instruction sessions with the ENL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

teachers.  Students receive ELA intervention with Wilson, Fundations, Language Power,  and Power Time . Students receive 
math interventions with small group instruction focusing on using manipulatives and visuals as a tool to increase 
comprehension skills.  The Science teacher works closely with the ELLs/ SWDs to ensure that science content knowledge is 
understood. Teachers are instructed to assist the ELLs-SWDs by using the glossary of terms in their native language. The 
content instruction is in English with native language support. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Students receive ELA interventions through our Response to Intervention programs such as  Wilson. Fundations, and small 
group instruction. Students receive math interventions with small group instruction focusing on using manipulatives and 
visuals to increase comprehension skills. The Science  teachers work closely with all ELLs to ensure content knowledge. 
Teachers are encouraged to assist the ELLs with using glossaries in their native languages. The content instruction is in English 
with native language support when available. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Students arriving new to the country are placed in small groups for ENL instruction. They take part in extra tutoring sessions to 
develop the basic communication skills that other beginners may have already acquired. Bilingual Glossary of Terms is 
provided in all the content areas to assist the native language speakers. The native language speakers of Spanish are usually 
placed in a monolingual setting with a teacher who speaks Spanish. These students also receive Spanish support in the content 
areas with their classroom teacher as well as the ENL teacher, who also speaks Spanish. The parents of newcomers are also 
invited to ENL workshops which will include literacy, arts and crafts, small group cooking in conjunction wit the LeAp program. 
All of our ENL families will be invited to participate.

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required support services and resources correspond to the students’ grade level, age, and NYSESLAT data. All our ENL 
groups are formed by grade level. All instruction is geared towards students’ ages. The students are grouped according to 
appropriate language ability level. Instruction is modified and/or scaffolded to meet student needs.  Students are also 
supported through small group instruction to help them  reach grade appropriate levels in listening, speaking, reading, and 
writing.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
During the parent engagement period on Tuesdays, parents are invited to come to the school to discuss their children 
academic progress with the teachers. Sometimes, in lieu of a face-to-face meeting, the ELL teachers give the parents a phone 
call to inform them about their child academic performance, language development progress, and language development 
needs in ELA. The staff will use the Language and Interpretation Services to interpret for parents who speak other languages. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

 
Fortunately at P.S. 130 a tradition of parental involvement has been established. In  September 2017 the school will hold  a 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74 

 

 

Meet the Teacher Night which provides all parents, including our ELL parents, the opportunity to meet their respective 
teachers and become familiar with expectations and procedures. This is always a well attended event. In order to 
accommodate our ELL parents we provide native language interpretation and translation based on the parents' preferred 
languages of communication. There will be a Family Literacy Night, Math Night,  and Art Gallery Expo  where parents 
participate in literacy, math and art activities with their children throughout the year. These nights are hosted by  all school 
staff. ELL parents  will be encouraged to attend these fun and enjoyable  activities.  The School community and families  look 
forward to this event every year.   
 
Staff provides our ELL parents with a directory to community based organizations to meet their individualized needs. Concerns 
and questions can also be addressed by our Parent Coordinator.  
 
Parents’ needs are evaluated through ongoing communication. The ENL staff meets with them during Open School Night, 
Parent-Teacher Conferences, and individual conferences as needed. Concerns and questions can also be addressed by our 
Parent Coordinator and the Parent Teacher Association. 
 
Parents have expressed concerns about being able to assist their students in English with limited English fluency. These 
concerns will be  addressed through Family Literacy and Math  nights, where families will be  shown how to interact with text 
in many ways. Also, the Teacher Center  maintains a library of bilingual books, as well as our school library, 
that  parents welcome to borrow to share with their students. Parents have also expressed concerns about navigating the 
many facets of the Department of Education. This concern is addressed primarily through one-on-one assistance by our parent 
coordinator. Also parents are made aware of the parent workshops and events sponsored by the Dept. of Ed. that address 
these issues. P.S. 130 also provides  Saturday  ENL classes and Citizenship courses for parents interested in improving their 
skills.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lourdes Velázquez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At PS 130X, we use different types of data and methodologies to assess the parents' preferred languages for both 
written and oral communication. The data and methodologies include, but not limited to:  

A) administering Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey  

B) conducting interviews with both parents and students to determine the parent's preferred language . For 
instance, we make sure that all parents complete Part 3: Parent Information from the the Home Language 
Identification Survey to determine the parents' preferred language. Many of our staff members are fluent in 
Spanish; therefore, they assist in interviewing the parents during the registration process. In order to 
communicate with the parents that speak a language other than Spanish, the ENL teacher administering the HLIS
