Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and informed by New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Implement at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify 

the instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content 
standards; provide time for collaboration on the use of) beginning no later than the 2018-19 school year. 

  Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 8: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 
The Curtis Estabrook School provides an inclusive nurturing environment, whereby effective support for academic and 
personal behaviors undergirds school improvement efforts. Central to the school’s mission to nurture a more 
cohesive learning community, which cultivates mutual respect and care for students and adults, is its opening 
exercise. Each school day begins with a lyrical ritual that affirms the potential of all members to achieve, both 
individually and collectively. 

 

 
2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, including 

a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented. 

The Curtis Estabrook School is an elementary school with 451 students from pre-kindergarten through grade five. 
The school population comprises 84% Black, 12% Hispanic, 2% White, and 2% Asian students. The student body 
includes 3% English language learners and 12% special education students. Boys account for 54% of the students 
enrolled and girls account for 46%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2017 - 2018 was 91.0 %. 

 

The Capturing Kids Hearts behavior management/leadership program supports the school’s priority of maintaining 
professional relations that reinforce common expectations among adults and encourage positive personal behaviors 
in students. Ninety percent of the staff and a cadre of parents have participated in training sessions for building 
supportive collaborative relationships resulting in the adoption of effective social-emotional and academic behaviors.  

 

School leaders and faculty adopt and adapt coherent and rigorous curricula that align with Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) ensuring opportunities to access higher order cognitive skills. Across all content areas and grades, 
the curriculum integrates instructional shifts aligned with Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) and Citywide 
Instructional Expectations (CIE) such as reading a balance of fiction and non-fiction texts, annotating texts, solving 
word problems using real life experiences, and justifying opinions with text-based evidence. The school implements 
the full resources of the core curriculum, Ready Gen, Teachers College and Go Math! Therefore, students experience 
explicit instruction guided by opportunities for high-level engagement. To further support student acquisition of 
grade level expectations, teachers augment modules to incorporate adjusted pacing of lessons and tailor the number 
of learning objectives taught during the implementation of units. Thus, curriculum maps reflect time-bound planning 
for engagement in close reading of texts, collaborative work to complete performance tasks, tasks to promote 
making math thinking visible, and writing activities to reinforce the use of academic vocabulary as such the school 
develops curriculum based on learning needs and standards.  

 
 
  
3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The school is particularly challenged with closing gaps for special education students, and for low performing general 
education students. However, revisions to curriculum and the work of teacher teams engender opportunities for a 
diverse population of students to access cognitively engaging tasks. Intentional organizational decisions that support 
the school’s instructional goals and strengthen teacher practice in order to create pathways to college and career 
readiness are facilitated. The principal intentionally allows time for collaborative team meetings, which result in a 
shared focus on grade or school specific goals. As a result, teachers have dedicated time to examine student work, 
unpack curriculum, critically analyze CCLS learning expectations, and create performance tasks that enhance learning 
experiences toward students attaining requisite skills. Team meetings follow clear agendas and protocols such as the 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

use of Collaborative Team Goal Sheets that result in progressive refinement of teacher teamwork. The school leader 
reviews goal sheets and provides weekly feedback on the instructional, pedagogical, and operational goals set by 
each grade team. Collectively, teachers summarize their use of this dedicated time by citing their work as 
"accomplishments". The principal evaluates the quality of their work based on relevance to the school's instructional 
goals, alignment to CCLS, and purposefulness of the activity. Written guidance coupled with reviews of student work 
and team artifacts assure coherence in teacher team practice toward acceleration of desired student achievement. 

 
  
4.  Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the 

past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which our school has made the most progress over the past year 
are: 

 

Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

 

Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 

 

Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 

 

The key area of focus for this school year are: 

 

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High 
standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing 
critical thinking skills. 

 

Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 

 

5.  Identify at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify the 

instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content standards; 
provide time for collaboration on the use of data) to be implemented in the 2018-19 school year. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

We will redesign school wide programming to reflect weekly dedicated common planning time across grade bands. 
This dedicated time will also be maximized to analyze data to validate as wel as inform instructional decisions. 

 

We will utilize our centrally funded Universal Literacy coach to support our early grade teachers through modeling 
and scaffolded literacy instructional support.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Across all content areas and grades the curriculum integrates instructional shifts aligned with the Common Core 
Learning Standards so that students experience explicit instruction guided by opportunities for high-level engagement.  

 

The focus for the 2018-19 school year is to improve the alignment of expectations and teacher instructional practices 
throughout the school by insuring the inclusion of rigorous tasks that stimulate higher-order thinking and build deep 
conceptual understanding and knowledge in all content area curriculum units. this focus was engendered from the most 
recent feedback from our quality review and the NYSED School Report Card. 

 

To this end, fourth and fifth grade teachers and students will engage in a departmental model for the delivery of 
instruction in Math, ELA an Social Studies. This is an innovation to leverage teachers' strengths and maximize the 
learning experience for students to engender improved student outcomes. This focus is also aligned with the district 
initiative.  

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          16 

 

 

To further move this work in the direction of better student outcomes, the school will engage in homogeneous class 
groupings. This is being implemented to expand upon the ideology of leveraging teacher strengths and maximizing the 
learning experiences of all students.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, teacher teams will engage in collaborative, as well as, departmentalized instructional practices organized 
around annual, unit and daily lessons, designed to facilitate the implementation of curriculum units in math, ELA, social 
studies and science which include rigorous tasks that engage students and promote high levels of student engagement 
and inquiry for all students. This work will be facilitated within a homogeneous instructional model and the 
effectiveness of this strategy will be analyzed by the BOY9 (Sept- OCT), MOY (Jan-Feb), and EOY (May- June) assessment.

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

Central to the school’s mission to nurture a more cohesive learning community, which cultivates mutual respect and 
care for students and adults, is its daily morning exercise. Each school day begins with a lyrical ritual that affirms the 
potential of all members to achieve, both individually and collectively. Students, faculty, staff, and parents joined by 
administrators gather in the gymnasium and auditorium to sing and dance to the school’s anthem Believe . The song 
selected by the principal for its inspiring message, promotes improved academic and personal behaviors, such as 
resilience and persistence fostering a culture conducive to mutual care and high esteem.  

Because the school community believes a nurturing environment supports improved academic outcomes, the school’s 
improvement efforts include a custom that supports an inclusive culture conducive to social-emotional growth.  

The focus for this school year is to encourage and participate in the development of all school constituents to be able to 
articulate how the school community is safe, conducive to learning and fosters a sense of ownership that leads to

By June 2019, school constituents will be able to articulate how the school community is safe, conducive to learning and 
fosters a sense of ownership that leads to greater student outcomes, through engagement in ongoing community 
building opportunities (i.e. Parent Leadership Retreat, Dad’s Bring Your Child to School Day, Fall Festival, Winter 
Wonderland, Family Paint Night, Family Night, Reaching Back & Pushing Forward Event etc ). We will complement the 
school’s current practices, especially the school’s implementation of Capturing Kids’ Hearts by introducing Restorative 
language and practices into out interactions with all stakeholders. Monthly meetings will be facilitated with the 
Community School Team to assess the success of each event and to determine if revisions are warranted. Meeting will 
occur every fourth Friday of each month.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review,

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

School leaders and teachers will insure that instructional practices and strategies are organized around annual, unit and 
daily lesson plans that address all student needs and goals through a collaborative approach to teaching, learning and 
planning. This approach will be supported by a homogeneous class organization. An analysis of teacher instructional 
practices and varied level of expertise, as well as, the overarching performance levels of our student population, suggest 
that from an instructional and organizational perspective, the homogeneous grouping of students, is a viable approach 
to maximizing student and teacher growth. 

Teachers will use a variety of formative and summative assessment tools to assess learning and determine student 
progress. Multiple measures of student learning such as baseline, mid-line, and end-line Performance Series 
assessments, Fountas and Pinnell Reading benchmarks, unit and chapter assessments, performance tasks, and student 
work samples will provide teachers with relevant information to determine trends and make purposeful adjustments to 
instruction. 

This work is being refined and linked to this year’s instructional focus aimed at strengthening teachers' pedagogy and 
team work that stimulates ongoing analysis of student progress toward grade and content goals. This work provokes 
thoughtful adjustments to instruction for targeted and differentiated groups of students as well.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our strength relative to this framework element is that there is a high priority placed on professional growth that leads 
to improved pedagogy and student outcomes. Administrators share teacher observation data with teachers to reveal 
patterns and individual needs. In addition, three short-term goals are developed individually, by each teacher in 
collaboration with the instructional coaches, who will in collaboration with school leaders, plan professional 
development for individual teachers, groups of teachers, and/or the whole school. Additionally, coaches and staff are 
supported by district and Department of Education collaborations for professional development. As a result, we are able 
to provide timely and relevant support in areas in need of growth through hands-on coaching, workshops, and team 
discussions. The district has offered a series on questioning to school leaders and groups of identified teachers that 
included modeling and instructional resources. As a result, this structure at the school level and district level, empowers 
instructional support leaders within our school to provide targeted teacher support leading to improved teacher 
development as evidenced by improved classroom pedagogy of teachers and informed tenure decisions.

and Time-bound.  
By June 2019, we will continue our efforts to facilitate parent workshops to continue to educate our parents on how to 
interpret data so that they can better understand and assist their children. Teachers and support staff will meet with 
parents during the parent engagement time to further assist and empower them with understanding all available 
student data. Meeting this goal will be evidenced by a monthly review of our school developed parent engagement logs 
which provides clear data on parent inquiries, the nature of these inquiries and the subsequent responses. The data

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 272, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

P.S. 272 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
The Community School strategy has integrated into academic instruction at P.S. 272 in that it has given our students, 
parents and faculty members a holistic means of support and resources to ensure academic stability and growth. Our 
strategy has integrated into academic instruction in that we have focused one the collective wellness of all pertinent 
family members and staff as well as the present involvement of those parties. Incorporating programming such as 
Chair Yoga, Positive Behavior Workshops for Parents, and Behavioral Management PD’s for school staff have spoken 
to the academic piece of our school community “whole”. Our students appear to be more academically sound due to 
the holistic level of support they are now provided by all key stakeholders in their lives. By improving parent-teacher 
relational capacity student academic outcomes have improved. Parent involvement in student homework and 
classroom projects has increased we believe largely due to our investment in the adult community.  

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
Our goals for 2018-19 are as follows: 

- Attendance - We’d like increase our Attendance Team count to 15 members so each grade level has a lead as well as 
1-2 support members; adding parents and students to the team. With that, we’d like to improve our attendance rate 
from 92% to 95% by 2019. 

- Parent Engagement – We’d like to increase our average parent volunteer rate to 15 total, consistent members. We’d 
also like to include 5-7 more parent workshops to create opportunities for continued education as well as parent/staff 
relational capacity. 

Community Engagement – This year we’d like to engage 2-3 community business to partner with to provide 
additional, need based resources for our school community. We will continue to work with our lead vendor, 
Prototype Educational Experience, a CBO in Canarsie, to create mentoring for our young people. The search continues 
for companies that will provide material and monetary donations to our school for additional support. 

 

 

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students? 
P.S. 272 will achieve these summative goals by ensuring that we nurture and develop the existing partnerships and 
programs, as well as foster new ventures based on the needs of our community. The anticipation is that through the 
reinforcement of social/emotional health, focused attention to high attendance rates individually and as a school, and 
creating a high level of relational capacity with our parents we will address any and all challenges that stand to hinder 
our students’ academic success.

activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.

to support our families. The families and staff have afforded the CSD the opportunity to serve their needs in order to 
positively affect our most important commodity, our students 

 

2. We have an existing, robust gamut of programming to address the needs of students and parents. Strategically, we 
will continue to provide our daily Mentoring Services to those students who have been determined to have a high 
need of social/emotional support outside of the classroom and home settings. Our in-school Social Worker will 
continue to ensure the needs of our special needs demographic will receive weekly support. We intend to maintain 
our in house, daily Asthma Case Manager to address those students who have chronic asthma which hinders them 
from school attendance as well as academic learning time due to this ailment. Through After School All Stars, our 
lead CBO, we will ensure additional academic support as well as enrichment during the after school hours.  

 

3. Each month we host a Community School Town Hall Meeting. This meeting includes all key stakeholders who are 
involved with the ever evolving aspect of our partnerships to ensure transparency, clarity, collaboration and 
implementation. We utilize the information obtained in these meeting to grown our foundation as partners as well as 
our foundation as a school community. Towards school year end, we host a Community School Forum to inform 
parents, staff and students of all that was implemented within the school community as well as provide an open 
forum to receive feedback, field inquiries and needs for the upcoming year, and celebrate accomplishments. 

 

4. Based on the rapport built with all key stakeholders as well as being an effective member of the School Leadership 
Team, we meet at least once a week officially and multiple times per week unofficially to discuss the intricacies of 
school trends and data. WE provide each other with tangible data, transparent feedback and productive next steps to 
ensure our information is leading to significant and impacting change for our school community

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
   The assessment tool our school uses to assess the early literacy skills are Fountas and Pinnell and Teachers College.  Fountas 
and Pinnell is used in grades K-5 in order to determine what reading level a child is on. These levels include the independent 
level, the instructional level and the frustration level.  These results can drive small group instruction, primarily in the 
formation of guided reading groups and can be an indicator of academic intervention when needed.  
 A child is given a passage to read and is timed for one minute.  During that time, the teacher takes notes on oral mistakes, 
omissions and self corrections in order to gauge areas of strength and areas that need improvement. 
  
In order to monitor the progress of ELL students throughout the course of the school year, the ENL teacher uses portfolios, 
rubrics, teacher observations, anecdotal reports, checklists and teacher-made tests and classroom assessments.  The ENL 
teacher collaborates with the ELL child’s classroom teacher  regarding ELL student progress.  
 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Workshops are conducted on how to assess students using the various assessments utilized. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The ENL teacher and school leadership analyze and discuss data from the NYSESLAT annually once the scores become 
available. From the data, we look for trends, possible problem areas, and modalities that our students are the strongest in. The 
ENL teacher then looks closely at the instructional practices and materials used in the previous year and reflects on their 
efficacy. After the reflection, decisions are made by the ENL teacher and school leadership on which programs and 
instructional practices might work best to meet the needs of our students. Also, the ENL teacher and school leadership devise 
a list of students who need the most support and target those students. The ENL teacher also makes decisions on the 
instructional focuses for the school year.  
  
The Title I teacher, Inquiry team members, ENL teacher, SETSS teacher, academic clusters, such as science, administer 
assessments and evaluate the results. Classroom teachers use the monthly assessments across content areas and conferencing 
sessions to evaluate if the child is making progress. The data from these assessments allow teachers to identify the students’ 
weak skills and re evaluate their own teaching. Teachers gear their instruction to the needs of their students.    
  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Some structures that are in place once the data is analyzed it is used to drive instruction are  RTI are small settings, stand-
alone and integrated services, differentiation in instruction, flexibility in grouping, as well as after school programs. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Classroom teachers generally confer with the ENL teacher regarding ELLs they feel may need additional academic support 
within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework. The classroom teachers and ENL teacher work together to devise a plan 
to help support students and bridge the gaps they have in regards to the mainstream curriculum. The ENL teacher will do 
additional testing to pinpoint the specific deficits a students has, offer suggestions to the classroom teachers on how to 
address the ELLs deficits, and also works to address those deficits when he pulls the students out for ENL services. The ENL 
teacher and classroom teachers also assesses ELLs regularly to determine their progress in closing the gap between their 
current performance level and grade-level readiness. For example, all students in the school are given the Fountas and Pinnell 
assessment to determine their reading level. However, ELLs who are newcomers or who cannot test with the Fountas and 
Pinnell are then given a phonics screening by the ENL teacher to determine their proficiency in phonemic awareness and 
reading readiness in English. Once the data is collected, the ENL teacher and classroom teachers then devise an intervention 
plan as well as a progress monitoring schedule to measure how well the ELLs who need additional supports are 
progressing.  PS 272 uses data from the monthly assessments to identify Tier II and III students. All of PS 272 is involved in RTI. 
The classroom teachers conducts RTI in their classrooms (Tier 1 and Tier II). There are also cluster teachers and out of 
classroom staff who also work with Tier II students.  
     
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Data patterns across proficiency levels on the NYSITELL (New York State Identification Test of English Language Learners)and 
the NYSESLAT both indicate that, in most instances, literacy skill development in both reading and writing lags behind speaking 
and listening development.  The NYSESLAT patterns across modalities confirm this trend with proficiencies developed in the 
following order:  Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing.     
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Sturctures that are in place from the ENL teacher creates her own schedule based on data and groups students according to 
language proficiency and mandates and grouping them based upon their needs and strengths. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

1a    P.S.  272 maintains a stand-alone ENL program.  The organizational model is two-fold.  It consists of stand-alone 
ENL with the certified ENL teacher and integrated ENL with a common branch teacher..  During stand-alone 
ENL instruction, ENL groups are arranged heterogeneously by grade level, either in a single grade environment or a 
combination of contiguous grades. For example; all grade fourth grade students may receive ENL instruction at 
scheduled times or the fourth and fifth grade groups may be scheduled to receive instruction together.  This is 
necessary to ensure that the state mandated minutes are delivered to each student based on his or her proficiency 
level. All ENL students receive integrated ENL in their ELA/core content area.         

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Paste response to questions here:    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here:    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Our school only offers a stand-alone ENL program. One ENL teacher serves them. Entering and emerging students 
receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week during their ELA instructional block from the ENL and classroom teachers and 
stand-alone ENL with the ENL Teacher. Transitioning students receive 180 minutes of integrated and stand alone ENL 
instruction per week from the ENL and common branch teacher during their ELA/core content area .  Expanding students 
receive integrated ENL instruction from the ENL and common branch teacher during their core content area. Commanding 
students receive 45 minutes of integrated ENL service from the ENL and common branch teacher during their ENL core content 
area. We utilize a blocked, ungraded, and heterogeneous program model to ensure our students receive their minimum 
program requirements.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
     General education and Special Education ELL students are grouped by grade and proficiency levels.  They participate in 
small-group, hands-on and task oriented activities which stimulate the production of verbal and written language.  Activities 
focus on balanced literacy, phonemic awareness, critical thinking, accountable talk and the workshop model.  Reading skills are 
developed through shared reading, guided reading, read-alouds and independent reading.  At P.S. 272, there is a strong 
emphasis on the development of writing skills for ELL students through the use of the writing workshop model, the four square 
writing method, syntax and spelling activities, editing and shared and creative writing.  P.S. 272 uses Ready Gen series in 
Kindergarten through fifth grade classes.  ELL students participate in the Ready Gen Series.  
  
The integration of literature and activities that highlight the diverse cultures of the community engage both students and 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

parents in a meaningful exchange of language and ideas.  It is vital to integrate language acquisition and content area 
instruction in order to promote academic language development. Thematic units provide meaningful new vocabulary and 
syntactical structures and are designed for maximum comprehensible input.  Students build a foundation of academic 
language which is enhanced by constant exposure to both new and familiar vocabulary.  A print-rich language environment is 
essential for cognitive language acquisition. Instructional scaffolding techniques such as bridging, reflecting, questioning and 
modeling are employed to support content area instruction and to improve comprehension.  Realia, pictures, big books, 
charts, maps and posters are used to provide context clues and improve English language proficiency. ENL strategies such as 
Total Physical Response, CALLA, and the Language Experience Approach are used to facilitate English language instruction. 
  
P.S. 272 has specialty teachers in Science as well as Computer Technology, Physical Education and Library/Writing to enhance 
content area instruction for ELL students.  Content area instruction is also delivered by the ENL teacher. 
  
Science instruction is provided for students, including ELL students, by a certified classroom teacher with a specialty in 
Science.  P.S. 272 employs the Harcourt series, Science. This series includes textbooks, overheads, workbooks, lab manuals and 
non-fiction literature for guided reading activities and read-alouds pertaining to science. Hands-on activities and science 
experiments enhance the science experience for the ELL students.  The Science series is geared towards students in grades 
Kindergarten through Five. 
  
Computer technology skills classes are provided for P.S. 272 students, including ELL students, by a certified classroom teacher 
who has participated in additional computer science courses.  ELL students receive hands-on instruction in all components of 
Microsoft Works, including Power Point, Excel and Microsoft Word.  Additionally, they receive instruction in notebook 
software for use with Smart Board technology. 
  
Math instruction is provided for students within their classroom by certified classroom teachers who use the Everyday Math 
Series. This series is used in grades Pre-K through 5 and is complemented by the Math Steps workbook in grades K through 
5.  While math appears to be the most universal of content area subjects, there is special attention paid to word problems 
which, in our experience, seem to be the most difficult for ELLs. 
  
 When the ENL teacher pulls out the students she focuses on ELA skills and uses the teacher's curriculum maps to align 
instruction. When she pushes in she pushes in during ELA and Math time. All instruction is in English. However, students 
receive Native Language support in their classrooms and in the ENL teacher's classroom. There are Native Language libraries 
and glossaries in ELA and Math.  The Treasure's Reach program is aligned with the Common Core Standards. The classroom 
teacher also assigns a buddy who speaks the same language to the ENL student.      
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Since we only offer a freestanding ENL program, there are no assessments given to students to monitor their progress in their 
home language.      
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

In order to differentiate instruction for ELL students, it is important to be familiar with the learning styles of your 
children.  Some students are concrete thinkers while others are abstract thinkers.  Some students have a learning style that 
requires them to see information in writing whereas others can process information simply through listening to it.  All students 
have different abilities, areas of strength and areas that can benefit from improvement. We have to identify how a child learns 
and then design a project for different skill sets.  For example, if you have a group that contains Entering, emerging, 
transitioning, expanding ENL subgroups, students can be grouped collaboratively.  If the goal is to produce a group project, 
students would be given tasks based on their individual learning styles and abilities.  If the group task is to create a chart for a

science project, an advanced level child may be adept at conceptualizing what the chart should look like.  An intermediate or 
advanced child can gather information for the chart, a beginner child might be able to draw the chart or cut sentence strips for 
the chart and an intermediate student could label the chart.  In this particular instance, the ENL teacher serves as facilitator 
while the children interact with each other and gain knowledge from each other.  The result is truly collaborative and offers 
beginner, intermediate and advanced students a sense of productivity and success. 
  
6a. P.S. 272 currently does not have any Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE). 
  
6b. Newcomers are an integral part of the ELL population at P.S. 272.  It is important to offer students an environment in which 
they feel comfortable and safe in order to garner maximum language acquisition and academic achievement. Newcomers also 
have access to Saturday Academy Program.   A large part of the success of newcomers also depends on parental 
involvement.  Newly arrived parents often have reservations about participating in school activities due to insecurities 
regarding their own English language skills or unfamiliarity with the school system in general.  We know that a child who 
receives additional academic support and interest at home usually has an increased chance of academic success.  To that end, 
P.S. 272 endeavors to engage the parent in school activities. The Parent Coordinator holds monthly parent workshops in which 
Newcomers are encouraged to participate.  We try to arrange for a parent volunteer who can provide translation services 
whenever possible.  The Parent Coordinator also serves as a liaison to community groups which can provide assistance in such 
areas as housing, counseling and employment.  Students who arrive prior to the beginning of the school year receive a tour of 
the school and explanation of services provided by an administrator on-site.  P.S. 272 believes in serving the community, the 
children who attend our school and the entire family unit as well. 
  
Due to the change in ELA testing from an exemption of three years to only one year, there has been a focus on providing 
additional support services in the literacy modalities as well as additional assessment activities within the mainstream 
classroom and the ENL classroom. 
  
6c. If a child is receiving ENL services for four to six years, the academic issues usually stem from difficulties in reading and 
writing.  The instructional plan for this particular group of students include English literacy development through content area 
instruction, literacy workshops in both reading and writing, and practice in reading and interpreting directions in order to 
improve test taking skills. 
  
6d. The ENL teacher supports ELLs receiving 6+  years of service during the instructional day. The targeted instructional focus 
depends on the proficiency level of the specific student(s). For instance, if a student scored proficient in listening and speaking 
on the previous year’s NYSESLAT but advanced or lower on the reading and writing modalities, the ENL teacher devises lessons 
that are primarily aimed to build the reading and writing skills of the student(s).  The ENL teacher closely analyzes the historic 
testing performance of long-term ELLs to identify trends and modalities in which the students score the lowest. Additionally, 
the ENL teacher verifies which students have an identified learning disability. If they do, the ENL teacher analyzes the 
qualitative and quantitative data in the IEP and employs the instructional recommendations in instructing students with 
disabilities. 
  
Former ELLs receive additional time on state assessments as allowed by the NYSED for two years after scoring commanding on 
the NYSESLAT. Additionally, the ENL teacher provides support to former ELLs during the weekly integrated ELA/core content 
area in the classrooms. Former ELLs are not pulled from their content classes to receive ENL services.P.S. 272 does not 
currently have any Long-Term ELLs.  However, these ELL students are entitled to attend the P.S. 272 Saturday tutorial program 
which focuses on reading comprehension, shared reading, writing activities, as well as mathematics.   
  
6e. The instructional plan for ELLs identified as having special needs is driven by the individual student’s IEP.  Goals are 
created based upon a child’s English language ability, learning style, and health and emotional considerations.  The 
instructional focus for literacy would be a high volume of pictures to expand vocabulary, the use of sight- words, hands-on 
activities, and multi-modality and multi-sensory activities.    
 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
.  A number of different instructional strategies and grade level materials are used with the ELL-SWD student.  Instructions are 
given in smaller increments so that the student is able to keep up with the class.  Wilson Reading is used for reading 
intervention and when working with the Ready Gen Program, the student uses the ELL books that come with the kit for guided 
reading activities.  When working in math, the student is provided with appropriate manipulatives for that topic.  The student 
is provided many chances to learn by visual methods. The students who have IEPS are involved in the RTI process. In addition 
students are assigned literature and non fiction text on their appropriate reading level and prompted to apply grade level 
concepts according to Common Core Learning Standards. There is a use of multi-sensory learning approach that incorporates 
visual, auditory and tactile activities. We provide additional presentations using repetition, paraphrasing and modeling. 
Students who have special needs will also receive extra services as per their IEP. For example, they receive ENL and RTI 
services.  Input form the team of teachers enables the ELL teacher to develop instruction that helps meet the child's individual 
needs.  Students in classes with paraprofessionals benefit from further differentiation of instruction. These students are given 
a variety of remedial aid to ensure that they meet the Common Core Learning Standards. We allow opportunities for 
movement.     
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The ELL-SWD student is mainstreamed during preparation periods (ie: gym, performing arts) and lunch periods. ELLs with 
disabilities are placed into three instructional program designs determined by the IEP team: ICT settings, 12:1 or 12:1:1, or 
general education with SETTS services. ELLs with disabilities, depending on proficiency level, are serviced at the same time 
through the freestanding ENL program as the other ELL's in their grade band through stand-alone ENL services. ELL-
SWD's receive integrated ENL services with the ENL and Special Ed. teacher during their ENL/core content area. Tasks and 
assignments are modified so that SWD's participate in the general education curriculum and are prepared to meet the 
CCLS.  The ELL's have equal access to all progams offered at PS 272. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
In all content areas, differentiation occurs within the classroom to meet the needs of ELLs depending on proficiency level. 
Teachers use heterogeneous and homogeneous groupings within their classrooms to meet the needs of ELLs at all proficiency 
levels. When students are grouped by ability level, the teachers target ELLs with less English proficiency, differentiate their 
assignment or task, and provide them with the supports to enable them to meet the cognitive demands and complete the 
task. Additionally, sometimes teachers will use mixed-ability groups. The purpose of these groupings is to provide ELLs with 
exposure to more fluent and proficient speakers of English. In this arrangement, ELLs have a model for both spoken and 
written conventional English, have the opportunity to engage with more proficient speakers of English, and have the 
opportunity to hear and use more advanced vocabulary and sentence constructions in English.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

11.  The 2016-2017 school year features an after-school program called OASIS.  This is a program that includes homework help 
and academic instruction in reading and math.  The program also features participation in clubs including fitness, dance, mural 
making, photography, and leadership.  The program takes place Mondays through Fridays from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 
p.m.  Academic instruction is provided by licensed P.S. 272 teachers.  After school instruction is provided by OASIS personnel.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELL students are afforded equal access to all school programs, both during the instructional school day as well as after- 
school activities.  Some ways that we ensure their access is to translate school letters to parents.  ELL students are invited to 
attend the P.S. 272 Saturday Academy which offers students assistance with test prep and provides enrichment activities.  In 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

addition, all students are invited to attend our after school program, All Stars. The after school program offers homework help, 
Sports and games, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math), Dance, Team Building, Voice, and Step.  All ELL 
students are encouraged to participate in once-a-month Friday evening family nights, which present the opportunity to join in 
inter-generational activities and special events.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
As previously mentioned, ELLs receive technology instruction during computer preps with a licensed teacher. Additionally, P.S. 
272 has a block of computers available in the school library which the children may use for doing research projects and 
information searches.  Many of the classrooms at P.S 272 have smart boards in place.  Smart boards have proven to be a 
valuable tool during instruction and children have become adept in using smart board technology.  ELLs have varied 
instructional materials at P.S. 272.  All instructional materials for ELL students are aligned to and ELA learning standards.  ELL 
students use the Harcourt Series,  the Rigby series, the Oxford Picture Dictionaries, Steck-Vaughn’s Phonics series, as well as a 
plethora of literature including fiction, non-fiction and poetry.  In addition, the instructional materials used to support each sub 
group are glossaries and native language books. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

P.S. 272 maintains a free-standing ENL program and does not provide direct native language instruction.  However, ELL 
students receive native language support through the Oxford Picture Dictionary series and the availability of native language 
books and literature.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The ENL teacher in our school works in collaboration with the content area teachers to ensure that the students of all ages and 
levels receive required services. The teachers analyze the results of periodic assessments in order to indicate what additional 
resources can be utilized to meet the needs of the students.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
As previously mentioned, ELLs receive technology instruction during computer preps with a licensed teacher. Additionally, P.S. 
272 has a block of computers available in the school library which the children may use for doing research projects and 
information searches.  Many of the classrooms at P.S 272 have smart boards in place.  Smart boards have proven to be a 
valuable tool during instruction and children have become adept in using smart board technology.  ELLs have varied 
instructional materials at P.S. 272.  All instructional materials for ELL students are aligned to and ELA learning standards.  ELL 
students use the Harcourt Series,  the Rigby series, the Oxford Picture Dictionaries, Steck-Vaughn’s Phonics series, as well as a 
plethora of literature including fiction, non-fiction and poetry.  In addition, the instructional materials used to support each sub 
group are glossaries and native language books. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
PS 272 does not currently have any programs that support newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. School 
leadership, parent coordinator, PTA members, and the ENL teacher invite parents / guardians of ELL's to attend workshops 
that address the educational needs of ELL's.  Translators will be available at the workshops.  Parents will be sent notifications 
in native their home language. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

P.S. 272 does not offer language electives. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

In which language(s) is each core content area taught?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 

Guide, Professional Development section. 
   
1. During the 2017-2019 academic school year,  Ms.LaMont,  the ENL teacher, will attend professional development workshops conducted by South Brooklyn.  Additionally, special education teachers, psychologists, O.T.'s, P.T.'s and speech therapists are included in ongoing professional development provided by the ENL teacher. we also tale advantage of any South Brooklyn 
Field Support Center staff development that our specialists can attend.  
  
2. All staff members receive ongoing professional development regarding instruction for ELLs throughout the school year. The ENL teacher regularly attends common planning meetings across the grade levels on Mondays from 2:40-3:45 and discusses issues and strategies with teachers regarding their ELL population.  Also, during monthly staff meetings, grade level meetings, 
and vertical team meetings, teachers receive ongoing professional development on differentiation strategies to use for their ENL students. During the common planning meeting the classroom teacher discusses with the ENL teacher what strategies they are working on and what  strategies that need to be readdressed are.  This is to ensure what is being done in the ENL 
classroom reflects what is being taught in the classroom. 
  
The ENL teacher will receive 50% of ELL specific professional development and teachers will receive 15% of ELL specific  professional development annually through workshops offered through the NYC DOE Office of English Language Learners. 
 
3. The transition from elementary to middle school can be a difficult time for ELL students.  Teachers have to explain the routines of the middle school such as departmentalization of subjects and the importance and responsibilities of having to move through the school independently and not in classroom groups. The ENL teacher, along with the classroom teachers, will meet 
with ELL students in small group settings  in order to address  these topics of possible concern.  Teachers will have question and answer sessions with the students throughout the school year.  School leadership and guidance counselors are continuously meeting with and collaborating with staff as well as giving input on students transitioning into middle school.  The guidance 
counselors also goes into these classes and gives presentations on the transitioning process and how how to fill out school selection forms.  
  
PS 272 staff, including classroom and cluster teachers, support staff, specialists, and paraprofessionals are supported by school leadership and guidance counselors by ongoing articulation regarding the needs, progress, or lack thereof of each ELL student at PS 272.  Guidance counselors already understand the difficulties of children transitioning to middle school.  Their 
professional development is provided by the ENL teacher in the form of ongoing meetings which highlight the additional linguistic and cultural factors that impact on ELLs as they transition. 
  
3. New general education and special education classroom teachers are mandated to receive 7 ½ and/or 10 hours respectively, of professional development in ENL materials and strategies.  Mandated staff development will take place during common prep time, grade conferences and faculty conferences.  Workshops will focus on cultural sensitivity as well as ENL standards, 
assessments and standardized testing.  Classroom teachers of ELLs will experience critical thinking and hands-on activities such as the use of the Interactive Smart board in the classroom, the Jigsaw model, Think/Pair/Share and Novel Ideas.  Workshops will be on-going throughout the year , taking place every  other month . They will include the following subjects: “ 
“Celebrating Cultural Commonalities – Demonstrating Cross Cultural Knowledge and Understanding.”, “Better Communication with ELL Children for Teachers and Parents.”, “Cooperative Learning Strategies for ELL students.”, “Test Taking Strategies.”,  “NYSESLAT- From Standards to Assessment.”, and “Promotional Criteria for ELL Students.” Classroom teachers, 
paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, school secretaries and the parent coordinator are all encouraged to participate in these workshops. 
  
Records are maintained by the ENL teacher through a) teacher name, b) nature of workshop: either faculty conference, grade conference, network conference, individual articulation or after school workshop, and c) time spent at workshop. 
        
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
P.S. 272 provides annual individual meetings on Tuesdays during our parent engagement.  Parents are encouraged to come in 
for a one to one meeting to discuss the goals of the ENL program.  Staff at P.S. 272 will provide translation as needed.  Parent 
notifications are sent home in their native language via the ELL student.  The goals of the ELL program, progress, 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

 

assessment results, development in content areas will be discussed with the ELL parent along with the classroom teacher with 
a translator if needed. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents of ELLs are involved with our school through our Family Night (paint night, games, movied, dancing, and basketball) 
which occurs the first Friday of every month from 6:00pm-8:00pm, Dads bring your child to School Day, Carnival, PTA 
Meetings, and our Career Day.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dakota Keyes, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The needs for written translation and oral interpretation changes from year to year. It is assessed by utilizing the 
Home Language Survey to identify languages spoken at home. ELL students, and parents of students who speak a 
second language at home, are able to rely on our school for translations (verbal/written) and be a part of the 
school community. Parents and students are able to attend functions, receive quarterly progress reports, 
upcoming events, parent/teacher conferences, IEP meetings, and all other school related events with the aid of an 
interpreter. Parents have equal access to school related functions. Parents are invited to attend workshops, 
become members of the PTA, volunteer at events, etc. Parents also have the opportunity to access ARIS to keep 
informed of their child’s progress on state tests. The data comes from initial meetings with parents, HLIS, and 
School wide surveys and ATS reports. We also keep a record of families that need translation services. We also 
provide interpreters at any school function for parents who request translation.     
The ENL teacher will provide official communication with parents in written form both in English and in the home 
language translation, when available. Languages spoken at our school: Arabic, Creole, and Spanish. Teachers will 
be notified of all ELL students at our school, home language, language of communication, score on the NYSESLAT,

and any other factors that may be important (IEP, resource, speech, etc.) In this manner, staff is able to 
communicate effectively to the parents regarding students. Our findings have revealed that in order to support 
the non-English speaking parents of our school, that the translation department provided by the DOE and our 
multilingual state certified teachers are able to translate both written documents and verbal information in timely 
fashions.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of an emergency, P.S. 272 sends messages to parents through School Wide Messenger. There is a 
separate group created for parents of ELL’s and the messages will go out in English and their native language. For the 
other native languages the parent will receive phone call via staff members who speak their native language. 
 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 
The staff at P.S. 272 receives the T&I brochure explaining how to use translation services and over the phone 
interpretation services and attend PD’s outside of P.S. 272 to receive further training on utilizing the T&I services.  
 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The Welcome Poster will be displayed in the main Lobby as well as the main office, and near the entrances used by 
parents and students during arrival and dismissal times. The school sends out flyers and notification letters in the 
language that is spoken at home. Parents are also invited to the workshops conducted by a teacher and an 
interpreter.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

In order to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services, the school sends out a parent 
survey to indicate the areas of strength and those that need improvement. The school also obtains necessary 
information during the Open School Night/Family Night when the parents are encouraged to express their opinion 
about the quality of services needed. Translation and interpretation is provided at all times.
