Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Graduates of Channel View School for Research (CVSR) leave as well-educated, involved citizens who have a love for 
learning that will enable them to embrace their futures with confidence and competence, using the lifelong strategies 
they acquired in our school. 

 

Additionally as educators we believe that we teach our students the critical thinking, communication, and 
collaboration skills that are needed to be successful in college, in future careers, and beyond. Our students develop 
their reasoning and discourse skills by engaging in high-level discussions and writing that are grounded in evidence 
across the content areas. Students learn leadership and community building though service learning projects, tenacity 
through rigorous coursework, and the value of exploration through inquiry-based learning.  

 

Core Values 

“We are crew, not passengers” is the motto that epitomizes our school’s core values and culture. Every student at 
Channel View becomes an active agent in her/his education, building our school community and contributing to the 
continued success of our school. We see the alliance between our students, their families, our staff, and the larger 
community we serve as an integral part of our work. 

 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Channel View School for Research is a Secondary School with approximately 900 students from grade 6 through 12. 
The school's population comprises 42% Black, 34% Hispanic, 13% White, 8% Asian and 3% Other students. The 
student body includes 3% English language learners and 14% special education students. Boys account for 47% of the 
students enrolled and girls account for 53%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2017-2018 was 91%. Our 
school community prides itself on being an inclusive community. As such we have an Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) 
Nest program on each grade that services approximately 30 autistic students and we have a ASD Horizons program in 
9th and 10th Grade. 

 

A cornerstone of our school’s values is Crew. As part of our partnership with Expeditionary Learning (EL) and NYC 
Outward Bound, we have implemented Crew in grades 6-12. The purpose of Crew is to build a safe and supportive 
community in which students can form meaningful relationships with their peers and with a staff member outside of 
their regular academic classes. Crews are small, gender specific groups in grades 6-8 and small, co-ed groups in grades 
9-12. Crews participate in team-building initiatives that encourage self-reliance and reliance on peers for success. 
Crews complete service learning projects, investigate colleges, and reflect on academic and character growth 
especially during Student-Led Conferences. During these conferences, students evaluate their progress toward 
mastery of both academic and character learning targets. Students justify their progress by leading their families 
through a portfolio of assignments culled from academic classes.

We promote positive character development and self-reflection with our S.T.A.R. rubric and 15 Words to Live By. 

 

Our S.T.A.R. rubric serves as a guide for our students’ continued growth. The S.T.A.R. acronym stands for service, 
trust, accountability, and respect. These standards form the foundation of our school’s culture; we emphasize them in 
our classrooms and in Crew. Students self-assess their progress in these categories each semester during Student-Led 
Conferences. 

 

Our school follows the 15 Words to Live By, which is a list of core values created by former Channel View students. 
We emphasize the 15 Words in Crew and throughout our classrooms. The 15 Words include: challenges, potential, 
responsibility, community, confidence, friendship, tolerance, respect, caring, kindness, trust, manners, honesty, 
achievement, and sportsmanship. 

 

The 2018-2019 school year we are proud to begin a partnership with the Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI). The 
MSQI supports schools in developing literacy in young adolescents, ultimately preparing them for success in high 
school and college. The MSQI program helps schools implement a research-based adolescent literacy framework for 
improving reading comprehension rates in New York City middle schools by providing resources, professional 
development, and ongoing site-based coaching.  

 

In 2018-2019 school year we are unrolling AP Capstone. AP Capstone is a College Board program that equips students 
with the independent research, collaborative teamwork, and communication skills that are increasingly valued by 
colleges. It cultivates curious, independent, and collaborative scholars and prepares them to make logical, evidence-
based decisions. 

AP Capstone is comprised of two AP courses , AP Seminar and AP Research, and is designed to complement and 
enhance the discipline-specific study in other AP courses. Participating schools can use the AP Capstone program to 
provide unique research opportunities for current AP students, or to expand access to AP by encouraging students to 
master the argument-based writing skills that the AP Capstone program develops. 

Channel View's Research technology and Robotics Program focuses on investigating and utilizing technology to 
support multidisciplinary research initiatives. Students foster collaboration and share state of the art technology such 
as drone technology, robots and 3D printers that can streamline and increase efficiency in data collection and 
analysis. 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

In addition to our ASD Nest Program, this year we will be adding a 10th Grade to our 9th Grade ASD Horizons 
programs. The ASD Nest Program is a partnership between the NYCDOE and New York University’s (NYU) ASD Nest 
Support Project. This program serves students with ASD and typically developing students in a reduced class-size 
Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) model. There are two teachers (one special education teacher and one general 
education teacher) in each class.The ASD Horizon Program was developed by the NYCDOE in collaboration with the 
New England Center for Children (NECC). This program serves students with ASD in a Special Class (SC), with one 
special education teacher and one classroom paraprofessional for every eight students (8:1:1). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

Students may have mild to severe delays in initiating and sustaining interactions with their peers. These difficulties 
require explicit social development intervention training.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which our school made the most progress over the past year are: 
Rigorous instructions – Our instruction is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. We believe rigorous 
instruction includes: students engaging in productive struggle, student-to-student discussion, and higher order 
thinking questions. This year our scholarship reports show a significant increase in student performance in class and 
Regents passing rates. Our entire 8th grade including ENL students and Students with Disabilities took the Common 
Core Integrated Algebra Regents and some students took the Living Environment Regents with 65% and 85% pass 
rates respectively. Classroom observation using the Danielson rubric reflected increases in student-to-student 
discussion. We will prioritize both formative and summative assessments. We will utilize the DRP in middle school as a 
common assessment. Additionally, we will revise curriculum to address gaps in students' learning and provide 
targeted actionable feedback to students with next steps for achieving mastery. 

In middle school item analysis in ELA indicates a need to focus on word meaning, central ideas, theme, plot and 
analyzing structure. In math, middle school and high data indicates a weakness across the board in Geometry. 

Consequently, our Theory of Action is if teachers are provided with targeted professional learning strategies on how 
to differentiate and scaffold writing instruction, then students will produce written products that demonstrate 
mastery of the college and career readiness reading and writing standards. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 90% of CVSR's students will produce two evidenced-based written research products that demonstrates a 
level 3 proficiency on a 6 scale rubric that is vertically aligned to the College Board AP Capstone student performance 
tasks.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

CVSR prides itself on its character, culture and community. We believe these pillars create an atmosphere where 
collaboration and rigorous instruction will propel students to succeed. The cornerstone of our supportive 
environment is our advisory class called “Crew.” These small groups (15:1 ratio) have an advisor to help young people 
learn teamwork, develop leadership and character and to ensure socio-emotional well-being. Crew leaders create 
safe spaces where students can share concerns and address issues or concerns in their school community. 

CVSR has implemented the Ruler program. RULER is an evidence-based approach for integrating social and emotional 
learning into schools, developed at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. RULER applies “hard science” to the 
teaching of what have historically been called “soft skills.” RULER teaches the skills of emotional intelligence — those 
associated with recognizing, understanding, labeling, expressing, and regulating emotion.  

CVSR had approximately 50 disciplinary incidents during the 2017-18 school year. Our priority for 2018-19 is to reduce 
disciplinary referrals by 20%. In addition to Crew, CVSR utilizes a restorative justice approach that helps young people 
resolve issues without using punitive measures. As a school we will expand our restorative justice program by 
ensuring that all of CVSR crews work with the restorative justice team to regularly engage in restorative “circles.” 
Circles are a great way to teach students skills to resolve conflict in a proactive way.  

In addition to the aforementioned structures we have four guidance counselors, two social worker, a SAPIS 
worker.and a CBO that support our students socio-emotional needs. These individuals also support staff in 
implementing effective practices that support student development. Counselors also regularly visits classes to ensure 
that the whole child is supported and any challenges are immediately addressed.  

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Channel View believes that professional learning communities that prioritize student learning succeed.  

According to the Framework for Great Teachers Report (2016), 100% of teachers utilized reflective dialogue, 98% of 
teachers indicated that peer collaboration improved work experience and 93% stated collective responsibility as 
positive responses.  

Consequently, CVSR will utilize its teacher inquiry teams to assess individual student's academic needs. CVSR’s inquiry 
teams will follow the inquiry team cycle to ensure rigorous, relevant, and engaging instruction that meets the needs 
of our students and ensures that students are college and career ready by graduation. 

Strengths: 

● All inquiry teams follow the NYCDOE Inquiry Cycle 

● All inquiry teams create and maintain inquiry data that highlight instructional adjustments and monitors specific 
groups of students 

Weaknesses: 

● Inconsistent opportunities to share instructional adjustments and best practices  

● Applying instructional adjustments that the teachers have made consistently and without prompting. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strong family and community ties are a foundation to the success of CVSR. The most recent School Quality Guide 
stated that 96% of parents are satisfied with the education that their child receives. As part of our NYC Outward 
Bound partnership, students frequently present their learning to authentic audiences. This formally occurs twice a 
year at Student led Conferences (6 th , 7 th , 9 th , 10 th and, 11 th grades) and Passages (8 th and 12 th grades). According 
to the Framework for Great Schools Report on teacher outreach to parents, we scored 94%. However, parent 
involvement in the school was 59%, which leaves room for much improvement.  

Strengths: 

● Student presentations of learning are meaningful and successful 

● All students work with a Crew leader to prepare for their presentations of learning 

● Instituted passages for 8 th and 12 th grade students 

Weaknesses: 

● Improve parent participation and attendance for SLCs and Passages 

● CVSR will create more opportunities for students to present their learning to authentic audiences 

● CVSR teachers will follow the DOE parent engagement framework to ensure that positive and meaningful 
engagement occurs. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, CVSR will increase family and community engagement by providing at least 4 workshops, presentations, 
and/or additional family events which will support the academic and socio-emotional needs of our students and 
families.

collaborations with. We retain our staff by establishing and maintaining a culture of collaboration and cooperation. 
We hold a summer institutes every August and also hold two weekend retreats, one in November and the other in 
February. All professional development begins with a team building initiative and a reading of a meaningful quote or 
excerpt. We also survey our staff to ascertain their professional development needs, and then plan our professional 
development accordingly. We are a strong believer in professional development and use our resources to give or send 
our staff to what they need. We send them to site seminars at other Expeditionary Learning Schools, institutes that 
specifically address their curriculum needs, meetings with subject teachers in other New York City Expeditionary 
Learning Outward Bound (NYCELOB) schools, Urban Advantage (UA) Initiative, Response to intervention (RTI) 
conferences, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Task Force, STEM Track, Special Education ICT models and strategies

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another

purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

communication involving student academic learning and other school activities, including ensuring— 

 that parents play an integral role in assisting their child’s learning; 

 that parents are encouraged to be actively involved in their child’s education at school; 

 that parents are full partners in their child’s education and are included, as appropriate, in 

decision-making and on advisory committees to assist in the education of their child; the 

carrying out of other activities, such as those described in section 1118 of the ESSA. 

 The school will inform parents and parental organizations of the purpose and existence of 

the Parental Information and Resource Center in the State.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Students new to the country are administered the NYSITELL.  They are also assessed using the Dynamic Indicators of Basic 
Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS), a performance-based reading assessment. In addition, our ELLs are administered a diagnostic 
through Achieve3000 that measures their lexile score. The data has shown that the results showed that not all students met 
literacy goals at equal rates. Many of our ELLs fell in to an at risk category scoring below grade level. As such, we have 
identified five elements of effective instruction for ELL students: (a) building and using vocabulary as a curricular anchor; (b) 
using visuals to reinforce concepts and vocabulary; (c) implementing cooperative learning and peer-tutoring strategies; (d) 
using native language strategically; and (e) modulating cognitive and language demands. Vocabulary development is a critical 
element of an effective English immersion program where reading instruction occurs in English simultaneously with English 
language development. Thus, vocabulary development must be integrated with all aspects of the instructional program. 
Studies have shown that it takes 5-8 years for an ELL after the age of 12 to fully grasp CALP vocabulary. Those students who 
have been in the US for three years or less will be strongly advised to take their Regents and State tests in their native 
language. When considering State examinations, the patterns across the proficiencies and grades are that the students would 
benefit from taking content area tests in their native languages, or having the tests in their native languages available. They 
are still acquiring the English language; although they may understand the concepts, they do not match their native English 
language classmates.

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The ENL Coordinator provides staff-wide professional learning which informs staff of the 5 elements of effective instructions 
for ELL students. The ENL teacher meets regularly with general education and special education teachers to plan lessons. The 
ENL teacher monitors growth on Achieve 3000. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We use the following baseline assessments: MOSL Performance Task, in class subject diagnostic exams, as well as Achieve 
3000. Student performance during class work and on exams is also considered.  We also use MOSLs to measure their AYP and 
NYSESLAT data to further analyze and drive instruction. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Following summative data gathering the ENL teacher coordinates with the students to develop student action plans which 
delineate areas of instructional focus as well as students strengths and areas of needs. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
N/A    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The following outcome assessments are used: NYSESLAT, MOSL Performance Tasks, MS ELA and Math city-wide exams, as well 
as Achieve 3000.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The ENL coordinator will provide professional learning to the staff in September.  The teacher will provide an overview of the 
prior years, data as well as instructional focuses from that data.     
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Channel View School for Research has a Departmentalized Educational program with both a Standalone and Integrated 
Freestanding ENL program. For Middle School, Entering and Emerging ELLs receive at least 360 minutes of Standalone and 
Integrated ENL instruction per week, Transitioning ELLs receive at least 180 minutes of Integrated only or Integrated and 
Standalone ENL instruction per week, and Expanding ELLs receive at least 180 minutes of Integrated ENL Instruction per week. 
For High School, Entering ELLs receive at least 540 minutes of Standalone and Integrated ENL instruction per week, Emerging 
ELLs receive at least 360 minutes of Standalone and Integrated ENL instruction per week, Transitioning ELLs receive at least 
180 minutes of Integrated only or Integrated and Standalone ENL instruction per week, and Expanding ELLs receive at least 180 
minutes of Integrated ENL instruction per week. Standalone ENL instruction is delivered by a K-12 certified ESOL teacher and 
Integrated ENL instruction is delivered by a K-12 certified ESOL teacher with a 7-12 certified content area teacher.  The 
students are grouped homogeneously in their ENL classes based on age (Middle School or High School) and their proficiency 
levels.

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
N/A    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The ENL teacher creates a program for each student ensuring that the mandated minutes of instruction are met. Classes meet 
for approximately 45 minutes during the 5 day school week. ELLs also receive Integrated ENL instruction in their Regents level 
English class. In addition, the students can attend a 50 minute extended day program five days a week and a Saturday 
Academy Program that meets for four hours.      
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Content area subject matter is taught by licensed teachers. Teachers use performance data to gauge student progress and plan 
instruction. The content area teachers use this data to group like students for tailored learning activities or to pair students at 
different proficiency levels in class. Teachers employ many ENL techniques to scaffold content. All four modalities of reading, 
writing, speaking, and listening are emphasized. All teachers use Core Standards as a guide for assessment. This year the 
emphasis is on using tools to produce high quality writing. Teachers use the SIOP model to scaffold not only content objectives 
but also language objectives. ENL strategies that are used to deliver comprehensible input include sentences starters, 
sequencing, various vocabulary building strategies, graphic organizers, word walls, activating prior knowledge and SQ3R. 
Beginner English students are allowed to use their native language as a means of accomplishing a task. The ENL teacher helps 
support the content area teacher by using the content area textbooks, notes, and review materials and supplements them 
with a variety of graphic organizers tailored to the lessons, hands on material, realia, visuals, flash cards, and computer 
programs to help the ENL students better understand the content area material and vocabulary. The Channel View School for 
Research staff uses a variety of strategies to meet the needs of our ELL students. The teachers use modeling, bridging, 
contextualization, schema building, text re-presentation, and metacognition to deliver sound a educational program that 
fosters both ENL and academic development and success.    
, 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Students are provided with testing materials in both English and their native language when available.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The ENL program at Channel View School for Research is provided with a comprehensive core curriculum and a balanced 
approach to literacy, including high quality instructional practices that facilitate academic excellence for ELLs. Data is used to 
improve teaching and learning. In addition, research based coaching and teaching strategies are used to support the students’ 
learning. 
a. The goal for the educational program for SIFE students is to help them gain the literacy and academic skills they need to be 
successful in school. The SIFE students focus on literacy skills, English language acquisition, and content area knowledge. The 
students acquire this information through small group instruction throughout the day, ENL services, and an extended day 
program.  
b. For newcomers, we provide orientation classes to help support them in adapting to what is in many cases a new and 
different educational system. We also thoroughly explain the graduation requirements and high school expectations upon 
entrance.  
c. For developing ELLs, we offer Credit Recovery classes, and Academic Intervention through tutoring after school, on Saturday, 
and during the school day. We also program with flexible scheduling in mind. Some classes are offered before the regular 
school day and after the regular school day. We also program identified students for Regents Preparation classes to help them 
graduate on time.  
d. Long Term ELLs receive differentiated teaching strategies to support their access to the content. Planning for each lesson 
includes analysis of the language demands of the content being taught, which leads to precise language objectives. Active 
student engagement and oral academic vocabulary is a focus in classrooms with LTEs. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

e. Our former ELLs receive at least two periods of integrated services weekly and receive time and half testing 
accommodations for 2 years.     
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
All ELLs-SWDs are scheduled to receive both their ENL and IEP services. The periods of instruction are explicitly identified on 
the students' programs. Both the ENL teacher and the Special Education teacher meet on a weekly basis to discuss the 
students' progress and ensure that all required services are being delivered. Additionally, the ENL teacher is part of the IEP 
committee. The ELL teaching program corresponds to the ELL students' ages and grade levels. All materials that are chosen are 
appropriate for the students' age and grade level. All of the content material is the same for both ELL and Non ELL students. 
The ENL teacher supplements those materials to ensure comprehension by the ELL students. The ELL teacher incorporates NYS 
Standards and the Common Core Standards for each grade level when planning her lessons. The ELL students are exposed to a 
a strong academic program that ensures language acquisition.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

All ELLs are given a differentiated curriculum to meet their specific needs. The goals of the ENL program are to provide 
academic content area instruction using ENL methodology and teaching strategies by using native language support to make 
content comprehensible. The ENL teacher teaches ENL strategic instruction, and helps ELLs meet or exceed state standards. A 
plethora of strategies and techniques are utilized to make language and content-based learning comprehensible to learners. 
These strategies include using differentiated and integrated instructional techniques. Teachers have content, as well as 
linguistic, objectives for each class, using scaffolding concepts (graphic organizers, writing templates, pre-learning, during-
learning, and post-learning activities, small group and pair work), activating prior knowledge, linking new learning to past, 
reinforcing key terms and vocabulary (word walls, note-taking techniques, keeping journals), highlighting functional language 
in context, adapting materials to make them more comprehensible, promoting critical thinking skills, providing summaries of 
lessons, using outlines, bringing realia to class, using technology in the classroom (the Internet, SmartBoards, overhead 
projectors), and using collaborative and cooperative learning activities (including various forms of group work). Strategies are 
also used to provide students with opportunities to use the language for meaningful exchange and negotiation of meaning. 
Some of these strategies are using hands-on activities, using technology and visual as well as aural materials, using 
demonstrations, practicing language, encouraging student participation and presenting information in class (presentations), 
completing projects (project-based and thematic activities), doing Constructivist type reading and writing activities (using 
reading strategies, e.g., prediction, questioning the text, making connections, visualizing, predicting, summarizing) and other 
meaningful, relevant, and engaging tasks. The standalone ENL program classes are taught by certified ESOL teachers who are 
trained in using an array of second language teaching methods and techniques as mentioned above. An important teaching 
goal is to have students pass the NYS Regents in English. Therefore, instruction is guided by the NYS standards and aimed at 
passing the English Regents as well as other Regents exams. For example, students are taught how to read and write critically, 
analyze data, discuss literary elements, read a text and take a position and defend it using evidence from a text or elsewhere, 
and so forth in all content area classes as well as the English classes. Language Arts is taught using both English and ENL 
methodologies.     
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Channel View School for Research has a number of different intervention services. Teachers use academic 
data to determine the needs of students. This includes state tests, aquity, formal and informal 
assessments, and classroom observations. Teachers in all subject areas offer interventions within the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

classroom setting by grouping, small group instruction, and scaffolding the material to meet individual 
students needs. In addition, Channel View School for Research offers students the opportunity to attend 
lunch tutoring, and small group AIS instruction in all subject areas.We also offer Extended Day instruction 
and a four hour Saturday Academy. Students also receive literacy instruction using the Achieve3000 
program in both ENL and ELA. We are an Expanded Success Initiative School that creates culturally 
responsive education programs to increase black and Latino males' success in school. Channel View 
continues to give transitional support for ELLs reaching proficiency on the NYSESLAT. We offer College 
Preparation and College Application classes to assist them in getting ready for college. They are given 
extended time during Regents exams and are allowed to use bilingual glossaries. In addition, students at 
this level often take College Now classes which give them a head start and allow them to become better 
prepared when they get to college.     
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
We are continuing to create culturally responsive educational programs in conjunction with our ESI initiative.  Also, every 
summer, all teachers meet for the Summer Institute Program to discuss and plan curriculum and come up with ways to 
improve teaching for the upcoming year.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
We have not discontinued any programs this year.  With such a small ELL population, our current ENL program is meeting the 
needs of our students.  
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
All ELLs are afforded access to all school programs. Our Student Government, Athletic teams, and CFO programs are comprised 
of ELLs, former ELLs, and non ELL students.   ELLs and former ELLs are also encouraged to attend extra academic support after 
school and on Saturdays.  

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

A variety of instructional materials are used to support ELLs. The students use print material such as novels, short stories, 
poetry, plays, newspaper and magazine articles, the Milestones ENL leveled textbook series and workbooks, computer 
programs for language acquisition, the Internet, realia, flash cards, and graphic organizers. All ENL students are enrolled in the 
Achieve3000 reading program. Each of these instructional materials are chosen at the appropriate level for each subgroup and 
ENL level. Many of the materials are designed on multiple levels (such as the Milestone textbook series and Achieve3000), if 
the materials aren't leveled, the ENL teacher chooses both teaching and support materials that are appropriate for each 
student's individual needs.

Research has a very active 
Parent Teacher 
Association. All parents 
are invited to join and are 
encouraged to become 
involved in the school 
community. There is 
frequent contact by mail, 
phone, PTA meetings, and 
through our school 
website. Parents' needs 
are evaluated through 
these ways as well. The 
parents of our ELL 
students receive 
translated information if 
needed and the staff is in 
frequent contact with 
them to make sure they 
are receiving information 
about school activities.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Language preference is collected and assessed in various ways. Firstly, upon registration parents are provided the 
Home Language identification Survey, which identifies the parents' preferred language. The Pupil Accounting 
Secretary goes over the form and if the parent does not speak English or does not understand the form, the ENL 
teacher is contacted. The ENL teacher remedies this situation by having the survey interpreted. Once the form is 
filled out, ATS is updated with the parents' preferred language and translation and interpretation services are 
provided when needed. Parents' preferred language is also noted on the Emergency Contact cards. Also, parent 
language preferences are assessed during parent meetings and especially during Student Led Conferences. 
Translation services are provided for parents as needed at meetings and conferences. The vast majority of our 
Limited-English-Proficiency parents speak Spanish and we have staff who are fluent in Spanish and ready to assist 
when needed. The ENL teacher also works with classroom teachers to translate information to be sent home to 
parents such as permission slips, trip information, etc.

School Staff Language Survey to determine which staff members are capable of providing translation and/or 
interpretation services and the ENL teacher will keep these responses on file.

enter the main office: Welcome Poster with multiple languages, Guide to Public Schools in, multiple languages, 
Parents Bill of Rights, Parents Guide to Language Access, PTA election poster in multiple languages, and Language ID 
poster. Parents of English Language Learners are also given information about the various programs available to their 
children in their home language through a video and brochure so they can make an informed decision about how 
their child will receive services. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The Parent Survey as well as informal data collection tools will help CVSR provide the best language and interpretation 
services to our families. Also, weekly meetings with the ENL teacher and the Assistant Principal will ensure that all 
necessary services are being provided in the best and most meaningful way.
