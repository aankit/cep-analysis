Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

SDC Mission and Vision Statement:  

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Every SDC student will design a path to college graduation and a successful career. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Our professional learning community provides a rigorous, innovative, and supportive high school experience to help 
our students develop the knowledge, skills, mindset, and social responsibility to achieve this mission. 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The boldness of our mission is the inclusion of every student and the notion that they are designing their path with 
our support – the goal is empowerment, not prescription. Over the last few years, our learning community has 
evolved in three major ways: 1.) Instructionally, we have worked collaboratively to create our Instructional Vision and 
in every classroom lessons are designed to promote student collaboration, making students critical thinking visible, 
and opportunities for students to take responsibility for their learning, 2.) Professionally, we created a teacher lead 
professional development that focuses on an inquiry cycle based learning environment, and 3.) We have an inclusive 
community that addresses challenges and conflict in ways that focus on relationships and keep students connected to 
the community. We have worked to develop an advisory program that monitors student progress and fosters 
community events that engage all students to be celebrated within our school. We have also utilized strategic 
partnerships to increase the connection between our core curriculum and the disciplines of design - creating rigorous 
and engaging curricula and projects in all content areas. We are continuing to partners with leaders in the worlds of 
Architecture (SOM), Engineering (Silman, Thornton Thomasetti), Construction Management (Turner Construction) and 
Design (The Beam Center) to develop rigorous, engaging curriculum and work-related experiences for our students.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

SDC currently has 18% Special Education students and 13% English Language Learners or former English Language 
Learners. 2/3 of our students enter with below Grade Level literacy and numeracy skills. These students represent a 
variety of learning needs which are addressed through programming, teacher collaborative planning, and targeted 
intervention. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our strength lies in our rigorous instruction and collaborative teachers in which teams and systems are organized to 
provide students with multiple layers of support and where all stakeholders are encouraged to pursue continuous 
growth. This has created distributive leadership throughout the school and unique opportunities for all individuals in 
the community to pursue leadership and have a hand in the growth of the community to improve the outcomes for 
our students. We have made significant advancements in our use of technology and of design-related performance 
tasks throughout the curriculum to engage students. 

During the 2016-17 school year, our emphasis was on improving our rigorous instruction, particularly by 1.) Planning 
thoughtfully to ensure a level of rigor in every class, every day that challenges students academically, intellectually, 
and developmentally; 2.) Establishing and utilizing systems for progress monitoring for every students that is 
communicated and utilized for goal setting by parents, advisors, counselors, and teachers; and 3.) Establishing 
standards for instructional and administrative practices that ensure all stakeholders and teams are focused on our 
mission. 

For the 2017-18 school year we are focused on improving our practice as it relates to Collaborative Teachers; aligning 
our resources to support teachers in collaborative teams to develop learning activities which push student thinking 
and offer opportunities to make that thinking visible.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Highly Qualified teachers will be attracted by posting job openings on idealist.org, the new teacher finder website, the 
open market transfer system, and association-specific job sites (i.e. Math for America for math positions, Natural 
History Museum for science). We have a selection committee of dedicated educators to help select the best of the 
highly qualified candidates. Our process includes an initial phone interview, performance task (i.e. analyzing student 
work, lesson modifications), demo lesson and debrief, formal interview, and reference check. Staff is presented with 
and connected to professional learning opportunities in-house and with external partners and providers. Our 
signature partner, the Urban Assembly, provides support for teacher teams and individual teachers through offering a 
variety of PLC opportunities. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Current staff receive on-going professional development each week to become Highly Qualified and to improve both 
content knowledge and learn best practices. Teacher-leaders facilitate professional development through grade-level 
and departmental teams that examine teacher and student work and utilize feedback. The Urban Assembly School of 
Design and Construction (SDC) works with our network and other organizations to identify additional professional 
development opportunities for our teachers.  

Our PD plan incorporates research-based strategies for 1.) curriculum development; 2.) lesson design; 3.) formative 
assessment; and 4.) and mechanisms for feedback delivery (teacher, peer, self-assessment). Teachers are grouped 
flexibly according to experience and ability as informed by classroom observation. Over 75% of professional 
development is led by teacher leaders. 

Our school also has a teacher-led Instructional Rounds group that makes observations, shares results, and leads 
professional development.

administered 3 times per year; independent performance tasks in the four core content areas; and content related, 
Regents based interim and state assessments. 

The Degrees of Reading Power is a periodic literacy assessment is supported through our partnership with the Urban 
Assembly with data collection and management and professional development for teachers on how to interpret 
results and make instructional decisions. The independent performance tasks in the four core content areas are either 
teacher selected or teacher developed. The content related, Regents based interim and state assessments are 
developed by teachers within academic department teams. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Urban Assembly School of Design and Construction, in compliance with 
the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and 
implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving 
them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to 
actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained 
volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The Urban Assembly School of Design and Construction will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

●providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

●providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

●fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

●providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

●sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

●providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

●actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

●support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

●maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

●conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

●provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Using quantitative NYSESLAT to determine eligibility as well as strategic groupings of students 
and New York State Exam data such as the Regent's to determine academic focus as well as 
qualitative feedback from staff/student interest surveys, we were able to create an enrichment 
program that focuses on Architecture and Design through observation and analysis while 
maintaining an ELA based instructional focus on and writing, reading, and academic discussions 
through workshops.  The goal of this program is to provide students with a scaffolded, but 
rigorous program that allows for ELL students to access native like peer models of both basic 
interpersonal communication while explicit instruction and development of cognitive academic 
language proficiency including interdisciplinary and content-specific vocabulary and complex 
sentence structures occurs with an ENL professional weekly on Tuesdays from November 13, 
2018 to May 27, 2019 from 3:15-4:15pm.  In addition, walking tours of New York City, field 
trips to the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Natural History, The Bronx Zoo, and The 
Brooklyn Botanic Gardens will be offered to supplement the program monthly on Tuesdays from 
October 2018 to May, 2019 from 3:15 pm to 5:15 pm The trips align to the instructional focus, 
building towards rigorous academic writing, in the following ways: building background 
information through observation and discussion, formulating areas of inquiry through exemplars 
of the content, and using evidence to guide written analysis. 
 
The schedule for the trips is as follows: 
 
October 30, 2018  (Intrepid Museum) 
November 20, 2018 (AMC Movie Theaters) 
December 4, 2018 (Museum of Natural History) 
January 15, 2019 (Metropolitan Museum) 
March 12, 2019 (Museum of the City of NY) 
April 16, 2019 (Bronx or Brooklyn Botanic Gardens)  
May 21, 2019(Bronx Zoo)  
No Program: 11/6, 1/22, 1/29, 2/12, 2/19, 5/7, 5/14 
The Title III program is offered to the forty-one English Language Learners in our 
community.  ELL students are grouped homogeneously by NYSELAT levels once a week and 
meet with the qualified ENL professional for language support, which is aligned to the 
enrichment topic of NYC Walk and Talk Tour for the month, and the Science licensed teacher to 
focus on the content and fabrication of travel brochures for each destination .  This will 
require one classroom weekly and a student to teacher ratio of approximately 20:1. The language 
of instruction is English for all courses within the program; however, we will offer home 
language support in the form of electronic reference materials, bilingual dictionaries, and 
translated informational documents that are sent to families.  In addition, the following materials 
will be purchased for the title III program: i-Pads, Storage Materials, and, Relevant Software 
Applications such as AutoCAD and Publisher.  Additionally, admission to the field trip 
destinations will be paid for with Title III funds. Only the materials, field trip admissions, and 
the direct instruction to the students will be paid for with title III funds.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The school uses periodic reading assessments through the Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) in September, December, and May 
each year. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The DRP is administered school-wide 3 times per year. Data is shared with staff.  Teachers make grouping and content 
decisions based on the results.  Students are conferred with on the results and the meaning of the data. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

Progress on English language is determined by NYSESLAT scores administered in the Spring of each year.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Students are placed into their Co-taught ELA classes which are supported by an ENL professional according to the data 
collected from the previous Spring of the NYSESLAT. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Using standards based in class formative assessments in the co-teaching model, teachers are able to provide two distinct 
services to ELLs. 1) Students are given opportunities within the class to be re-taught based on the data collected in the in class 
formative assessments and 2) students have the opportunity to focused small group instruction within the ELA class. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 
Parent notification letters, Annual parent meetings, allocated professional development focused on instruction of ELL 
populations 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Freestanding ENL classes are determined by the students' most up to date scores for the NYSESLAT or 
NYSISTELL.  Services for in class support in the 9th and 10th grade ELA classes are determined by the same 
method.  The cohort of ELLs in the 9th grade are placed in one class and receive in class services with an ENL certified 
teacher four times per week.  The cohort of ELLs in the 10th grade are grouped into one section of ELA and receive in 
class services with a licensed ENL teacher 4 days a week.  11th graders are grouped into one section of US History and 
receive support from an ENL certified teacher four times a week. 12th graders are grouped into an Economics class 
and receive integrated services with an ELL teacher 4 times per week.  Emerging students additionally receive small 
group instruction twice a week for a total of 98 minutes. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The school uses the data from RLAT report to determine the number of instructional minutes required and then schedules the 
students into a co-taught ELA class consisting of one licensed ELA teacher and one licensed ENL teacher or a co-taught US 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

History class consisting of one licensed History teacher and one licensed ENL teacher.  Freestanding ENL classes are taught by 
an ENL licensed teacher. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The freestanding ENL program is an interdisciplinary course that uses thematic standards based content from ELA, History, and 
Mathematics to deliver reading, writing, speaking and listening, and language instruction at the appropriate level of the 
student according to the results of the NYSESLAT exam.  The ENL teacher co-plans with the ELA teachers to shape curriculum 
that facilitates second language acquisition and provide appropriate language scaffolds to promote access to materials.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

There is currently no assessment in place to evaluate home languages. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Newcomers are placed in either a 2 period a week or 4 period a week stand alone ENL/ESL class that supplements the material 
that they are doing in their humanities classes.  
Developing ELLs and former ELLs are strategically programmed into Co-taught ELA courses with a content and ENL 
professional.  The CO-teaching teams meet bi-weekly to plan for and assess student work. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers use the Rti model to plan in class interventions for ELLs and SWDs.  In addition,  teachers use scaffolds such as 
graphic organizers and glossaries to provide access to grade level materials for all students.  Teachers additionally use 
backwards design in planning a progression of questions that promote deep thinking and offer multiple entry points for 
students. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
* 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
A school-wide Data Dive will be conducted in October in order to identify and hypothesize interventions for each specific sub-
population and specific to class; newcomers, developing, Long Term, SIFE, Former, and ELLs with disabilities.  The data dive is 
led by the ENL professional as a part of the 15% ELL focused PD.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Matthew Willoughby, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Data from the RAPL ATS Report has been collected and sorted for preferred oral and written languages of parents 
and/or guardians. We have updated this information in the PARU ATS report by consulting Home Language 
Identification Surveys of over the counter students and/or Emergency Contact Cards. 

 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
