Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

“To produce students who achieve the highest educational standards; students who are fluent in two languages; 
problem solvers; critical thinkers; and students who will be active participants in the life of their family, their 
community, their city, their state, their country and the greater society, the world. "

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P. S. 189 The Bilingual Center is a K-8 grade school located in an inner city neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. It is 
housed in a five-story building that has undergone major renovations but still lacks a gymnasium. The school has a 
large Afro-American, Caribbean, Asian, Arabic and Hispanic population. According to the latest available ethnic data, 
69.2% of the student population is Black, 24.8% is Hispanic, and approximately 5.7% of our remaining students are of 
Arabic, and Chinese ethnicity. Approximately 5% of our families are recent immigrants, mostly from Haiti and the 
Dominican Republic. 3.8% percent of our students live in temporary housing, and 90.2% are economically 
disadvantaged. Student attendance rate is 92.8%. 

 

In order to fulfill its mission “to produce students who achieve the highest educational standards; students who are 
fluent in two languages; problem solvers; critical thinkers; and students who will be active participants in the life of 
their family, their community, their city, their state, their country and the greater society, the world " the school has 
implemented the following strategies: 

 

· There are four classes in Kindergarten, grades 1 and grade 5 while in grades 2 through grades 4 and grades 6 through 
8 there are five classes. In each grade there is 1 or 2 monolingual classes, 1 Dual Language Spanish, and 1 Dual 
Language Haitian- Creole, i, 1 ICT monolingual, 1 Stellar/Gifted, 1 Dual Language -Spanish, and 1 Dual Language -
Haitian Creole; in grades 7-8: 2 monolingual, 1 Stellar/Gifted, 1 Bilingual-Spanish, and 1 Bilingual-Haitian Creole.) A 
freestanding ENL program services English Language Learners (ELL) who are not in the Dual Language program.  

· Students at the elementary level (K-6th) receive instruction in self-contained classrooms that utilize specialty area 
teachers to enrich the curriculum. Students in the Middle School (7th -8th) receive instruction in a departmentalized 
setting with specialty teachers in all major subject areas.  

· Homeroom teachers of grades 1st to 6th usually loop with their students for two years. In the middle school (grades 
7th and 8th) ELA, math and science teachers loop for a two year cycle as well. 

· Foreign language instruction in Spanish, French or Haitian Creole is implemented across all grades and classes. Latin 
is taught to all students, in grades 5th and 6th, including ELL and Special Education. 

· In all grades, the ELA curriculum is supplemented with Core Knowledge, Expeditionary Learning (EL), Junior Great 
Books (JGB) and the American Reading Company’s 100 Book Challenge Independent Reading Program. 

· A technology lab and computer carts on each floor provide students and teachers with opportunities to infuse 
technology in teaching and learning. Approximately 31 classrooms have Smart Boards.  

· Eighth graders are offered advanced courses leading to New York State Regents and Foreign Language Proficiency 
exams in English, Algebra, Earth Science, Biology, Spanish, and French. 

· Currently, P.S. 189 works with several organizations / partners: Haiti Cultural Exchange provides, through a grant 
from Extended School Day Violence Prevention(ESD/VP) a STEM and ARTS after-school program for students in grades 
3 through five; Haitian American United for Progress (HAUP) provides an after-school program for students in grades 
6 to 8; The Boys and Girl Scouts of America provide character education and recreation activities for our lower 
elementary students; The Brooklyn Children Museum provides after-school enrichment activities for students in 
grades K-5; AVID, provides professional development aimed at developing a college-going culture school wide; the 
Technical Assistance Center on Disproportionality (TAC-D), assists us to develop programs and behavioral supports for 
students from vulnerable populations. During academic year 2018-19, Franklin Covey will provide continuing 
professional development to fully implement the Leader in Me, a school-wide transformation process that teaches

leadership and life skills to students and creates a culture of student empowerment based on the idea that every child 
can be a leader. 

 

The school has not had a Quality Review in a few years, but on our most recent 2016-2017 Special Education Quality 
Assurance Special Education Programs and Services Review, which was conducted by the State in February and March 
2017, the reviewers found that there were adequate opportunities for SWDs to participate in academic activities. All 
providers are given opportunities to review students' IEPs and to collaborate with their homeroom and ICT teachers in 
the designing of their academic programs and plans. Parents are afforded access to their children's records records at 
their request, and amendments made at no cost to the parent. Lastly it was found that the maximum class size for 
SWDs was met.  

 

Among the priority areas that were identified in the Special Education review were the need to improve rigorous 
instruction and the supportive environment to ensure that instructional and planning strategies meet the needs of all 
students, by specifically focusing on is improving the quality of Individualized education plans to include specific 
information about students relative to their present levels of performance (PLOP) to include students ELLS status and 
specific ELL needs in (IEPs) for SWDs. additionally each IEP annual goal needs to be revised to include evaluative 
criteria, evaluation procedures, and schedules to be used to monitor students' progress toward achieving their goals. 
Lastly, reviewers stated that we must improve in the timely implementation and progress monitoring of students' IEP, 
relative to frequency, duration and intensity. 

 

 

The Framework for Great Schools Survey 2017-2018 indicates that our strengths lie in the area listed below: 

 

Framework Measures School Score District Average Score Citywide Average Score 

Rigorous Instruction 4.13/5 + 0.59/5 + 0.49/5

(a) Improving parents participation in workshops 

(b) Improving communications with parent via home-school folders, Online monitoring tolls. 

(c) Intensify and refine strategies the use of data to drive instruction and assessment. 

Finally, a review of the school's most recent ELA and Math State exam results revealed that the school made gains in 
ELA for all students, as the number of students achieving proficiency rose from 53.9% in 2017 to 60.2% in 2018. 
Additionally, the performance of all students on the math exam rose from 52.5% in 2017 to 56.7% in 2018. Despite 
our gains of 6% and 4 % in ELA and math respectively the school still needs to intensively focus on leadership and 
pedagogical practices by improving the quality of math and English Language Arts instruction and academic 
intervention services for students this school year, to ensure that all students gain proficiency in literacy and 
numeracy.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Students with disabilities (SWD) make up 14% of our student population; 3% of them are serviced in self-contained 
classes, 3% in ICT classes, and 8% receive Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS). English Language 
Learners make up 19.4% of the total student population. Four percent of our students live in temporary housing. 

 

The needs of both our English Language Learners (ELLS) and students with disabilities (SWDs) are often very similar as 
both groups often require the specific scaffolds and supports like audiovisual resources, visual aids, dictionaries and 
glossaries hands on learning opportunities and manipulative, etc. 

* Our long-term ELLs also need to be intensely engaged in activities intended to improve their speaking, reading, 
writing and listening abilities as they strive to become English proficient.  

*Our SIFE population needs intensive literacy in their Home Language so as to improve their mastery of the academic 
language of L2 (target language) 

*Our SWD who are not reading on grade level need additional support in the form of interactive literacy programs. 

 

The school offers a range of services that support students with disabilities in the most appropriate, least restrictive 
environment. During the academic year 2018-19 there will be three self-contained classes, one at the lower 
elementary level, one elementary and one at the middle school level, and four ICT classes, one at each grade level 
excepting 1st, 2nd and 3rd grade. Additionally, special needs students are supported by three teachers who provide 
Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS), 2.5 speech pathologists, two guidance counselors, a social 
worker, a family worker and a school psychologist, including a bilingual Spanish school psychologist. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

As identified by the 2017-2018 Framework for Great Schools Report, the school’s areas of celebration include: 

*Supportive environment: ....This speaks to course clarity, quality of student discussion, inclusive classroom 
instruction, focus on student learning 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

*Collaborative Teachers...This entails peer collaboration, inter- visitations, scheduled vertical and horizontal planning 
meetings  

*Rigorous Instruction...This means that Instruction is customized and aligned to the Common Core Standards. 
Students are actively engaged in developing critical thinking skills 

 

Our greatest challenge and hence our focus for this school year is continuing the implementing of rigorous instruction 
to meet the needs of our large and diverse population with the current level of funding. Additionally, we struggle with 
finding dually licensed bilingual/content area teachers for the middle school, dealing with space limitations that do 
not allow us to open additional classrooms to facilitate implementation of the NYC Special Education Reform/Paths 
for Success, the lack of physical education facilities, and outdated computer/technology equipment.  

 

A review of the instructional report for the spring 2018 State standardized assessments showed gains in both ELA and 
mathematics . However, the performance of students with disabilities (SWD) and English Language Learners (ELL) is of 
particular concern as both groups have a low percentage of students performing at Levels 3 & 4 proficiency in both 
ELA (SWD-38%, ELL-35%) and mathematics (SWD-41%, ELL-29%) . As such, the key area of focus for this academic year 
is on implementing effective strategies to address the large number of students lacking basic skills in both 
mathematics and language arts, especially in writing and problem solving, and on providing intensive professional 
development for teachers in strategies to implement a rigorous, engaging, and coherent curricula aligned to the 
Common Core Learning Standards

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

As stated above, a review of the school's most recent ELA and Math State exam results revealed that the school made 
gains in ELA for all students, as the number of students achieving proficiency rose from 54% in 2017 to 60.2% in 2018. 
In addition, the performance of all students on the math exam increased from 53% in 2017 to 56.7% in 2018. 
Consequently, the school made a 6% increase in ELA and a 4% increase in Math. However, mean the school needs to 
place continuous intensive focus on leadership and pedagogical practices by improving the quality of Math and ELA 
instruction and academic intervention services for students this year. However, our strengths continue to include 
teachers working collaboratively to strengthen common-core aligned curricula based on pre-assessment data, and the 
use of grade-level assessments to make modifications for whole class and individual students. Evidence includes: 

· Inquiry groups 

· Analysis of student work using LAST protocol (thinking-based protocol) 

· Identification of trends, (questioning, discussion, writing and vocabulary) 

· Focus on writing 

· Teacher/student use of rubrics 

· Rubric based feedback and next steps 

· Students self-assessing with rubrics 

 

Although our 2018 ELA exam results show that the school continued to make gains, our in-house school-based 
formative and summative exams continue to show that a substantial number of students continue to be in need of 
improvement in: questioning and discussion opportunities in the classroom in order to improve their ability to: 
engage in rigorous thinking and writing, use appropriate grade level academic vocabulary, respond to open-ended 
questions requiring multi-step procedures, and to apply a variety of mathematics practices like perseverance, multiple 
representations, and the appropriate use of math tools to solve real-world mathematical situations. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15 

 

 

The Framework for Great Schools Survey 2017-2018 indicates that our strengths lie in the area listed below: 

 

Framework Measures School Score District Average Score Citywide Average Score 

Rigorous Instruction 4.13/5 0.59/5 0.49/5 

Collaborative Teachers 4.59/5 1.03/5 0.96/5 

Effective School Leadership 4.29/5 0.74/5 0.77/5 

Strong Family Community Ties 2.70/5 -0.88/5 -0.88/5 

Trust 3.88/5 0.30/5 0.34/5 

 

In an attempt to continue the improvement in Math and ELA scores the activities below will be implemented and 
expanded:  

(1) Enhance and strengthen an even stronger family and community ties by: 

(a) Improving parents participation in workshops 

(b) Improving communications with parent via home-school folders, Online monitoring tolls. 

(c) Intensify and refine strategies the use of data to drive instruction and assessment. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, the number of all students in grades 3-8 achieving proficiency on the New York State English Language 
Arts Exam and on the New York State Mathematics exams will increase by a minimum of 5% as compared to 2018 
results. Principal and assistant principals will provide feedback and actionable next steps through workshops and 
classroom observations to ensure actualization of goals.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

To ensure that the students are actively engaged in rigorous 
tasks that meet the demands of the Common Core standards, 
teacher teams will continue to reorganize and implement CCLS-
aligned units of study in a sequential manner that exposes the 
students to the full range of standards and practices. In addition, 
teacher teams will also continue to make extensive use of 
exemplar problems in math and exemplar writing samples in 
ELA. 

Common Core aligned curriculum programs, Go-Math in grades 
K-5, ST Math, Mathletics, Discovery Education and Reflex Math in 
grades 3 & 4, and CMP3 in grades 6-8, will be used to develop 
students’ conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, and 
their ability to apply math in context.  

In ELA, rigorous learning opportunities will be provided through 
Common Core aligned curriculum programs: Core Knowledge in 
grades K-2, Expeditionary Learning in grades 3-8, 100 Book 
Challenge and Junior Great Books in grades K-8. In addition, 
Achieve 3000, Imagine Learning and Discovery Education, in 
grades K-8, will provide accelerated opportunities through text-
based questioning and discussion of literary and informational 
texts.  

Regents and specialized programs will be provided to students of 
grade 8 in ELA, math and science. 

Both ELA and Math will have dedicated blocks in the schedule. 

AVID will deliver professional development aimed at closing the 
achievement gap in select 5 th and 7 th grade classes. some of the 
professional learning that teachers will engage in will focus on: 
planning activities that will support students with engaging in 
rigorous thinking and writing, using appropriate grade level 
academic vocabulary, responding to open-ended questions 
requiring multi-step procedures, and to applying a variety of 
mathematics practices like perseverance, multiple 
representations, and the appropriate use of math tools to solve 
real-world mathematical situations.

populations, in small groups during the school day by Learning 
Support Team (LST) members, and during after-school and 
Saturday programs. 

Parents/guardians will be invited to meet with their child’s 
teachers to discuss academic progress and parent concerns every 
Tuesday, either in person or via telephone conference. In 
addition, workshops informing parents about core curriculum in 
ELA and Mathematics will be held periodically. In preparation for 
these workshops, teachers will create CCLS curriculum-aligned 
activities for parents to use at home to support their child’s 
achievement. Parents will also be invited to visit the school for a 
school-wide orientation within the first week of school and 
during grade specific Open Houses thereafter. They will be 
encouraged to attend workshops on a variety of subjects such as 
the school curriculum, assessments, standards and school 
conduct expectations. A monthly calendar will be published to 
keep parents/guardians informed of on-going educational 
events. The school messenger system will be utilized to deliver 
notices via telephone in the dominant languages. A school 
webpage, that includes individual class web pages, will be 
available to keep the school community abreast of school events 
and activities. All school related materials will be addressed to 
parents of English Language Learners in English and the parents’ 
native languages (for example, Haitian Creole or Spanish.)

Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Some of the strategies we have implemented to create a supportive environment include: 

School wide implementation and application of the Covey's seven habits; some of the seven habits include: 

(a) Students are encouraged to be proactive and think before they act. Reinforce the concept that every incident 
constitutes only 10% of an action, while our response to the incident constitutes 90% of the action. Reinforce and 
strengthen the fact that students are in control of their choices and actions.  

(b) Reinforce and encourage students to practice to listen and understand the position of others before seeking to be 
understood. 

(c) Teach and encourage students to apply the skills of beginning each task and situation with the end in mind.  

 

Evidence of the impact of improving a supportive school environment, can seen when trends in superintendents and 
principal suspension data in OORS are examined: 

Type of Suspension School year 2015 -2016 School year 2016- 2017 School year 2017- 2018  

Principal Suspension 10 5 

Superintendent Suspensions 4 1 

 

The data above indicated that there was a 75% decrease in the number of superintendent suspensions from school 
years 2015 to 2017. The number of principal suspensions also declined by 50% over the same period. It must be 
pointed out that our school population average over the time periods mentioned above was 1,100 students.  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          20 

 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

By June 2019 there will be a 5% increase in math and ELA proficiency as measured by the New York State Math and 
ELA Exam in grades 3-8. It is therefore important to foster a supportive learning environment in which students feel 
safe, relaxed and willing to take risks to expand their sense of family while enhancing their self-esteem so that 
students can maximize their fullest potential. 

The activities below will be implemented and expanded to meet this goal. 

(1). It is therefore important to foster a supportive learning environment in which students feel safe, relaxed and 
willing to take risks to expand their sense of family while enhancing their self-esteem. 
(a). Building strong classroom community 
(b) Building self-esteem and self-efficacy 
(c). Motivate students 
(d) Intensify and refine strategies using data to drive instruction and assessment. 

(e) Rigor instructions across all classrooms, including all subgroups as evidenced by the Danileson Framework

In an attempt to strengthen strong Family and community Ties 
and the school’s culture of safety, PS 189 will implement several 
strategies:  

All students 
from grades 
K-8 

Every month 
Sept 2018-
June 2019 
Ongoing- 

School leaders, 
coaches, and 
teachers. 

Students will also 
begin monitoring 
the community 
building activity and 
their study packs.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All adults and 
students in 
the PS 189 
Learning 
Community 

 

 

● Building strong Family and community Ties Community 
building activities will be implemented in all classrooms. For 
example, every morning, students and teachers will shake each 
others hands, making eye contact and giving their peers a 
positive morning greeting. 

 

● Strategies to increase parent involvement and engagement: 
Students have been asked to create posters and presentation 
around the HEART 2 virtues that drives their study packs. 
Students will be making presentation of their pact and their 
heart virtues to parents during the Tuesday parent engagement 
hour.Parents will be shown the concept of the pact as a strategy 
of building community parents will have discussions about how 
they can support students in the area of community building. 

The seventh and eighth graders will participate in Study Pacts, 
sub-communities that are designed to practice the HEART 2 
virtues of: Humility, Encouragement, Accountability, Respect, 
Tact and Thankfulness. The objectives of these study pack 
include but are not limited to deepen the PS 189 Learning 
community by modeling positive virtues aimed at building each 
other holistically and academically.  

  A Student Publication Committee will produce at least 1 

publication before June 2018. This will help provide a 
platform giving students a broader voice though 
creating a student school publication totally edited by 
the students highlighting their achievement, creative 
expression, critical thinking, and innovation as it relates 
within the school as well as current global events. 

● Providing safe and supportive learning environment.  

There is no 
ending date 
to the 
deepening 
and 
strengthening 
of 
community. 
It is our vision 
that this will 
be 
permanently 
integrated in 
the PS189 
culture.

Students will be challenged by peers and teachers to give their 
best efforts to their tasks. Success of students reaching these 
challenges will be celebrated by student assemblies, example 
ARISTA - Honor Roll. Assessment and monitoring of community 
building activities in weekly advisory. Additionally, the student 
government, and students in general will be encouraged to 
pursue responsible student leadership roles that will foster 
respect, healthy challenges and support for each other 

● Staff mentors will be assigned to students in need, e.g.,

The element of collaborative teachers received an overall score of 4.59 on the 2017-2108 Framework for Great 
Schools Report and a rating of well developed on the 2015-16 School Quality Review. Although end of year ADVANCE 
data shows that 90% of teacher practice was rated effective or highly effective, there is still a need to improve 
practice in domains 3b- Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques (52% effective or highly effective), and 3c 
Engaging Students in Learning (61% effective or highly effective). 

Parent workshops emphasizing their understanding of collaborative teachers will be conducted at the school twice a 
month during the Tuesday parent engagement period and on Saturdays. Teachers will share strategies and protocols 
with parents such as good study habits, time management and homework etc help to foster students' success. 

Parents will be invited to the annual "Literacy Night" and "Numeracy Night" where both parents and students will be 
engaged in games designed to foster critical thinking skills in both ELA and MAth. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

The school structures and schedules weekly team teacher 
meetings, common planning time and inquiry groups. These 
teams follow a protocol to create unit plans for the Core 
Knowledge, Expeditionary Learning, Junior Great Books (JGB), Go 
Math, CMP3 instructional programs, align learning targets to the 
CCLS and Social Studies framework and make connections to all 
subject areas. Teachers collectively follow protocols to analyze 
student work, identify student strengths and needs and plan for 
rigorous instructional lessons based on multiple sources of data. 
Professional Learning Communities (PLCs), based on needs 
identified on each teacher's Professional Development Plan, are 
scheduled on a bi-monthly basis. PLCs are lead by instructional 
coaches and lead teachers. This structure lends itself to a 
platform for teachers to share best practices and resources in a 
non-evaluative and supportive venue. In addition, monthly data 
teacher team meetings are held to analyze grade wide data 
result trends to inform instructional decisions. 

 

Professional development is differentiated to meet the target 
needs of individual/groups of teachers through self-selected 
participation in PLCs, peer inter-visitations, article studies and 
individual Professional Development Plans.  

Teachers collaborate and plan strategies to differentiate 
instruction that support and engage all learners. This will result in 
increased achievement and outcomes. The strategies include: 
scaffolding, processing tools for discussion and tiered activities.  

Teachers will engage in professional learning communities with a 
foci on: 

● engaging students 

● developing a school wide cohesive definition of ‘Rigor’ 

● seamless integration of the school D.R.E.A.M. (Develop, 
Reflect, Engage, Assess, Make connections) philosophy.

Teachers will participate in collaborative teaching which include:  

● Learning Support Teams (LSTs) collaborate with classroom 
teachers to identify student needs and collectively develop 
strategies to improve small group targeted instruction.  

Teachers will develop a ‘Rigor Toolkit’ of resources to develop 
and support rigorous instructional activities. Pedagogues will 
administer monthly and New York State ELA and Math periodic 
tests to monitor students learning. 

All teachers, including those of high need student subgroups, 
collectively prepare developmentally appropriate activities in 
both ELA and Math to share with parents which provide models 
designed to extend the learning opportunities conducted in class.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

P.S. 189 The Bilingual Center  

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 189K, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Our school will support parents and families of Title I students by:  

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology;  

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 
decision making in support of the education of their children;  

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress;  

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand;  

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of our school community;  

 

●To encourage and support Town Hall Meetings that promote effective partnerships with local businesses. 

Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation through 
school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, 
and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, our school will:  

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s 
Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to schools to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;  

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies 
as described in our Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical 
support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator will 
provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who attend our school and will 
work to ensure that our school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will 
also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central 
office.;  

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support 
services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents 
of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be 
involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other 
applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);  

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, our school will:  

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s 
Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to schools to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;  

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies 
as described in our Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical 
support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator will 
provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who attend our school and will 
work to ensure that our school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will 
also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central 
office.;  

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support 
services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;  

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents 
of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be 
involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other 
applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

    P. S. 189 / The Bilingual Center is a K-8th grade school located in an inner city neighborhood 
in Brooklyn, New York. It is a Title I/PCEN school-wide program that services approximately 
11,000 students.The school has a large Afro-American, Caribbean, and Hispanic population. 
According to the latest available ethnic data, 73% of the student population is Black and 24% is 
Hispanic. Approximately 20% of our families are recent immigrants, mostly from Haiti and The 
Dominican Republic. Students with disabilities (SWD) make up 14% of our student population; 
3% of them are serviced in self-contained classes, 3% in ICT classes, and 8% receive Special 
Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS). Seven percent of our students live in temporary 
housing, and 93% are economically disadvantaged. Student attendance rate is 95%. English 
Language Learners make up 19% of the total student population. 
      One hundred and ninety-nine (199) of these are bilingual students / English Language 
Learners. The bilingual students range from kindergarten through 8th grade. There are four 
kindergarten and four grade one classes. Three of these classes operate under a “Dual Language 
Program” (Spanish/English/ Haitian Creole), while the other operates as a “gifted and talented” 
class. There are five classes at each grade level from grades 2 to grade 8. In 
order to support the ELL students with special needs, there is a Spanish Bilingual Special 
Education self-contained class.  Currently, there are five Integrated Co-teaching (ICT) classes in 
the school ; ranging from grades 2 through grades 6 . 
        For the academic years 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 Kindergarten through grade six will have 
a “Dual Language Program,” while grades seven and eight will have two bilingual classes 
(Spanish/English and English/Haitian Creole). Currently, of the approximate 199 bilingual 
students, there are 21 in kindergarten, 18 in first grade, 28 in second grade, 33 in third grade, 13 
in fourth grade, 21 in fifth grade, 28 in sixth grade, 17 in seventh grade and 20 in eight grade. Of 
this total, 07 are in Special Education classes. The findings of a comprehensive needs assessment 
resulted in the identification of several key factors necessary for Improving students’ 
performance. These are: school-wide implementation of effective strategies to address the needs 
of students lacking the basic skills in both reading and mathematics; implementation of effective 
strategies for meeting the needs of ELLs and providing intensive professional development for 
teachers in specialized strategies to meet the needs of special populations. From the findings of 
this comprehensive data analysis, it has been decided that the ELLs would participate in three 
supplementary programs: 
(a) The ELA Saturday Academy, which would encompass the “long- term ELLs” .  Long term 
ELLs are those English Language Learners who have been in the New York Public School 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60

System for three or more years and have gained proficiency statys on the 
NYSESLAT Test.  Long term ELLS who fall into this category are mandated to take the ELA 
Exam. This program will NOT be be funded by the Title III Program. 
(b) The Title III After School Program will target all ELLs, in grades two to six, with a year or 
less in the public school system. These ELLs will be taking the ELA Exam for the first time. The 
program will also target the ELL students from grades three to six who are not required to take 
the ELA Exam. These are students who have been in the New York schools for less than year. 
These students are performing at the 'entering'  and or "emerging" proficiency levels. 
(c) The SIFE Program will target ELLs in grades 7-8 for additional support to meet the standards 
in ELA, 
Math and Science. This program will be funded by the Title III Program 
      The Title III After School Program will meet for approximately 40 sessions on Wednesdays 
and Thursays from 2:30 -  4:00 p.m. beginning  November 17, 2016 and ending Thursday May 
11, 2017. The program will service about 110 students at a ratio of 18 students per teacher with a 
total of six teachers. Of these six teachers, four are Bilingual certified, one ESL certified and two 
Common Branch (CB) certified. The Common Branch certified teacher will be  partnered with 
one of the Bilingual teachers. This program will seek to individualize instruction and meet the 
diverse emotional, social and academic needs of our ELL population. Our instructional model 
will use both English and the students' native language to improve academic and social language 
skills. To achieve this purpose various programs and activities will be implemented. 
      These programs include: Teachers’ College Writing: - “Assessing / Teaching Reading Skills 
in the 
Bilingual Classroom”, Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT , "Language Power" and the “Math 
Power ESL.” The Math Power ESL is a customized version of Math Power: A Course for 
Teachers. Espousing the Piagetian Constructivist Philosophy, “Math Power ESL” is anchored on 
the New York City Performance Standards, the New York State Core Curriculum and the 
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Principles and Standards for 
Mathematics. It also draws from theories of language acquisition, the SIOP (Shared Instruction 
Observation Protocol), which is a component of the AAEM (Accelerated Academic Language 
Model) and the CALLA (Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach). This approach 
seeks to meet the needs of the English Language Learner by integrating mathematics and English 
to create a math objective and an English Language Objective. To strongly support the latter, this 
approach made extensive use of the article “The Multicultural Classroom: Reading for Content-
Area Teachers” written by Patricia A. Richard Amato and Marguerite Ann Snow (Longman 
Publishing Group 1992). Although the integration of math and language is the primary focus of 
this approach, it does not exclude the other academic subject areas such as Science and social 
studies in the lesson. Math Power ESL lends itself to mastery of mathematical concepts through 
guided discovery, the use of manipulative and connections to real world situations. 
    The purpose of Teachers’ College is to challenge teachers to reach readers who present widely 
different strengths and needs. This program exposes / refreshes teachers to using differentiating 
instruction in the classroom. It will survey the four models to make differentiation manageable 
and 
reading enjoyable for all readers, no matter their differences. The course objectives includes the 
following: Understanding the primary role assessment plays in differentiating instruction, 
Discovering 
how readers differ and what actions teachers can take to reach different readers, grouping 
(wholegroup, 
small-group, pairs, or individuals), and differentiated reader support each requires. 
     In conjunction with these programs, “The Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT” is designed for

instructions, using on-going assessment activities to measure progress in attaining English 
Language 
Proficiency and to familiarize both teachers and students with the structure /. Format of the test 
Trips (museum / theater) 
     An additional resource for students at the "entering and the "emerging" levels is Language 
Power. This program provides ensures systematic language development support. The program 
is highly differentiated and thematically based instructional resource. 
      Another key activity of the Title Three Academy is that of developing language as a social 
tool. (a) Robert E Owens (1996) expounds the fact that Language is first and foremost a social 
tool. It is as a result of this scientific view that trips to museums, theaters and zoos will also be a 
vital part of the Saturday Academy. The bilingual students / ELLs need exposure to various 
aspects of the American culture. With this in mind, students will be exploring the following 
themes: “Special People and Places”, “Animal Tales” and “Across the United States” The aim of 
the theatre visits is to give students concrete situations / exposure to the things learned in the 
classroom. Language is influenced by its environment, and in turn, influences that environment 
(Owens 1996). It has been shown by research that language is heavily influenced by context and 
that language acquisition also takes place in informal learning environment i.e. museum and 
theaters. 
b) Secondly, the teachers will also be making use of the thematic approach which lends itself to 
extension of the lesson to other subject areas. For example, the teachers will be doing the 
following 
units of study called “Houses and Homes,” and “Planet Earth” These units lend to the extension 
of 
science and social studies subject area where students will look at animal homes. It is based upon 
these 
perspectives: (a) the scientific view of language being learned in a social setting and (b) the 
aligning of 
trips with the units of study, that trips to the zoos and museums will be undertaken. 
       The students will visit the Bronx and Prospect Park Zoos. They will also visit the Brooklyn 
Children’s 
museum and the theatre. The museum and the Bronx Zoo facilitate prearranged “class-like” 
settings, 
where the students can explore related subject matter i.e. science complete with “life-Size” 
models. 
Other activities will include cooperative learning, the use of audio-visual technology aids and the 
engagement of prior knowledge to facilitate the acquisition of literacy skills in  "Home Language 
Arts while 
providing meaningful communication and fluency in English. The following table shows the 
proposed 
dates/schedules for these educational trips.

        Materials will be purchased from IMAGINE LEARNING. This is a language and literacy 
software program that features interactive content, including activities, videos, songs and games. 
It is researched based, and instructionally differentiated. The "IMAGINE 
LEARNING PROGRAM" also has an assessment element which: 
a). documents growth toward proficiency via the annual growth test 
b). beginning to end of yesr data 
c). Featuers for monitoring oral fluency and written responses 
         Our Bilingual/ENL programs and activities are guided by scientific based research, which 
has proven 
over time the effectiveness of Bilingual Education. Cummins (1989) has found that there is 
strong 
correlation between literacy in the native language and English acquisition. Research shows that 
working in all four modalities: listening, reading, writing and speaking helps students in 
language 
acquisition. Our instructional program will therefore place emphasis on integrating all four 
modalities. 
For example, students could listen to a story, talk about it, read the story and then respond in 
writing. 
Writing processes/skills in the native language can be transferred to second language learning 
(Grebe 
1991). Language skills usage consists of listening, speaking, reading and writing. Our instruction 
integrates all four modalities as recommended by Echevarria, Vogt & Sort (2000), Edgier (2001), 
Petegoy 
& Boyle (1997), Goldenberg (1993), Goldenberg & Pathey-Chavez (1995).

      Professional Development will be provided to all staff to support the effective delivery of instruction. 
Our professional development for SY 2016-2017 will focus on the components of the curriculum: Math 
Power ESL (Math coach). The sessions will be conducted by the Math Coach, Mr Gilbert Torchon, who is 
certified in both the Bilingual and Common Branch areas. The Teachers College Reading and Writing 
Project (TCRWP), located at Teachers College, Columbia University, has been a premier provider of 
professional development for schools in New York City, across the nation and internationally for almost 
three decades. Their mission is to support literacy instruction through research and professional 
development. Their research has tackled many subjects, including, of course, the teaching of reading and 
writing K-8, but also including methods of supporting large scale school reform, of coaching teachers, and 
of leading schools in which young people grow to be avid and skilled readers and writers. These sessions 
will be conducted by Ms Blanca Pena-Brennan  (LicensedShe is also ENL teacher / ENL coordinator )who

is dually certified as an English and ENL Teacher.  Ms Evelyn Gracia will also "turn-key"  training 
received re Imagine learning training. Ms garcia is the Technology and Social Studies coach. 
  
Rationale: The focus will be on helping / supporting teachers through these sessions, to integrate 
content area materials through hands-on activities while students develop literacy skills and English 
language proficiencies through authentic and communicative language activities. Research has shown 
that teachers of ELLs require extensive support to expand their subject matter knowledge and 
knowledge of content specific teaching strategies so that their students can get a deeper understanding 
of content areas, develop academic and social language. (Garet et al., 2001: kennedy, 1998) 
Our Bilingual/ENL programs and activities are guided by scientific based research, which has proven 
over time the effectiveness of Bilingual Education. Cummins (1989) has found that there is strong 
correlation between literacy in the native language and English acquisition.  Mr M. Dejoie (translator /

Begin description here:            
            
Our ELL parents continue to be an integral part of the Title III Program. All school based home 
communication will be translated into the respective native languages. Parents will be invited on 
5 
Sessions during the Title III program to participate in a series of informative workshops about 
the 
NYSESLAT, and how they can help their children prepare for this exam. The presenters for this 
parent 
workshop will be the ESL teacher and the Assistant Principal. They will also be exposed to 
sensitive legal issues regarding their children. The presenter for this segment will be the parent 
coordinator and the Guidance Counselor. The rationale is that some ELL parents are new to the 
country and are therefore not aware of these legal issues. Support for parental involvement is 
shown in compelling research evidence which suggests that parental involvement has positive 
effects on children’s academic achievement (Carasquillo & London, 1993; Delgado-Gaitian, 
1991; Heine, 1992; Henderson, 1987; Quelmatz, Shields & Knapp, 1995). The sessions will be 
conducted by the program supervisor and parent coordinator. In order to facilitate parents’ 
participation in these workshops, we will purchase metro cards for their transportation. We will 
provide light refreshments as well which will not exceed the cost of $350.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 The school uses the Fountas and Pinnell Running Records in grades K-4 while the Teachers College Running Record kit is used 
in grades 5-8. The running records kit is used to pinpoint the instructional reading level of each child. The assessment results 
are used for instructional grouping and for lesson planning and curriculum adjustment. For example, students will be placed in 
guided reading groups based on their reading level. This reading assessment is administered quarterly. Students are 
encouraged to monitor their own progress through the use of their data note book. Conference notes are kept by the teacher 
which details the progress and mastery of various skills to bring them on grade level reading.The school also utilizes an 
independent reading program called 100 Book Challenge. This is where the students are encouraged to read independently at 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

 

their "comfort level". This program monitors the students reading frequency and their mastery levels to questions here:    
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The independent reading program is an online program purchased by the school which monitors and tracks the number of 
minutes for each student. Additionally students are rewarded for each reading mile stone met. This reading program provides 
students with books in Spanish and Haitian Creole. 
Teachers are provided with a guided reading program/ kit. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 The success of the school's program is evaluated using the school-based and state tests. The growth of the students are 
measured and tracked across the school year and measured against the NYS tests. In this way the school is aware of the 
effectiveness of the various programs to enhance target language acquisition.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The school uses a data collection tool which triangulates data. In addition each classroom has a data wall which reflects the 
past and current data of the class. teacher teams meet regularly to analyze and review data. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
The NYSESLAT Data is shared with all members of staff working with the ELL population.: Teachers are therefore able to have 
dialogue driven and centered around data. The data is therefore used to pinpoint areas of weakness and strength both for 
teachers and students. This is done on a consistent basis to ensure rigorous instruction and student achievement. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
  The NYSESLAT data reveals that 65% of ELLs are at the Intermediate and Proficient level. In comparing the data with the 
previous year's it became apparent that a significant number of the students have been in these two categories for the past 
two years. It would also apparent that a small percentage of the students regressed between last year and this year   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?

proficiency groups. Students in the TBE program also receive ENL instruction. 
 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Students are grouped by language composition to make a class, for example a Spanish 
Dual Language Class and a Haitian Creole Dual Language Class. They travel together as a 
class. Within these classes there are mixed proficiency levels. The dual language classes are comprised of proficient 
English speakers as well as English Language learners. 
 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 The school has two ENL teachers and several staff members with bilingual extensions to their content areas.

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Content area can be delivered in the target language (English) or in the Native Language. However, the teacher is not allowed 
to switch back and forth between languages. If the lesson is being done in English then the teacher must provide a linguistic 
summary in the native language at the close of the lesson. The same is standard for the reverse, if the lesson is being done in 
the native language then a linguistic summary must be provided in English at the close of the lesson.  Teachers use a variety of 
strategies to teach the concepts. These include but are not limited to "total physical response",  "buddy-system" (child who is 
between the transforming to the commanding level paired with a child who is on the entering level) and "picture support" 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

The translation team translate in-house tests for Haitian Creole and Spanish speaking students. This is done in addition to the 
Spanish ELL periodical test. These tests are apart of the school's testing calendar. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

The school implemented a 1/3 split regarding instruction in every classroom. This split includes  a high , middle and low 
functioning groups. Each teacher is required to color-code their lesson plans to show differentiation for each group; for 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 The grade level materials are expeditionary Learning program, 100 Book Challenge, Core Knowledge, Junior Great Books 
Anthology and Imagine learning. Content area can be delivered in the target language (English) or in the native languages while 
Junior Great Books has translated stories in Spanish. However, the teacher is not allowed to switch back and forth between 
languages. If the lesson is being done in English then the teacher must provide a linguistic summary in the native language at 
the close of the lesson. The same is standard for the reverse, if the lesson is being done in the native language then the 
linguistic summary must be provided in English at the close of the lesson. teachers use a variety of strategies to teach the 
concepts. These include but are not limited to "total physical response", "buddy system" (child who is between the 
transforming to the commanding level paired with a child who is on the entering level) and "picture support". 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The school has a general planning meeting, grade planning meetings and grade conference  facilitate dialogue between 
providers and homeroom teachers. In addition all teachers are provided with data for every child that they are scheduled to 
workwith.  The curriculum maps are updated monthly  wherein accommodation are inputted to reflect adjustments to 
curriculum. This is done on a continuous basis. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The targeted Intervention for Ells include support for the students who are taking the ELA State test for the very first time. 
These students are "prepped" daily . The school also provides a Learning Support teacher who works with a small group during 
content area instruction. Students are also give home access to the online program "Imagine Learning."  The supplemental 
Title III Program also targets new comers, SIFE students and long-term ELLs.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?

At this time no program is being considered for discontinuation. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
The ELL student has access to other after school programs such as the "Brooklyn Museum After School", HAUP, Boys Scout etc. 
These programs are announced and discussed at every PTA meeting , where translators are provided. Parents are also notified 
in writing (translated) to apply to all programs provided in te school. At registration the parent coordinator also inform parents 
about available programs. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
   The instructional materials used are Expeditionary learning Program, 100 Book Challenge, Core Knowledge, Junior Great 
Books Anthology and Imagine learning. The program Imagine learning is an online literacy tool which provides support not only 
in English but also in several native languages, while Junior Great Books has Spanish translation 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

Content area can be delivered in the target language (English) or in the Native Language. However, the teacher is not allowed 
to switch back and forth between languages. If the lesson is being done in English then the teacher must provide a linguistic 
summary in the native language at the close of the lesson. The same is standard for the reverse, if the lesson is being done in 
the native language then a linguistic summary must be provided in English at the close of the lesson.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

At registration  each child is evaluated by either the ENL teachers and or the math and literacy coaches. 
The  ENL teachers reviews the HILIS forms to ensure accuracy of placement and services. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
    
The instructional materials used are Expeditionary Learning Program, 100 Book Challenge, Core Knowledge, Junior Great Books 
Anthology  and Imagine learning. The program Imagine Learning is an online literacy tool which provides support not only in 
English but also in several native languages; while Junior Great has translations in Spanish. 
 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
New ELL parent orientation meetings are scheduled at the beginning and during the school year to familiarize parents with the 
school system and the different programs that are offered. A DVD on parent orientation by the Department of Education is 
shown to parents in their language, and parents have the opportunity to discuss the three program choices and complete the 
Parent Surveys and Program Selection forms.  Open -houses are scheduled throughout the year for parents of all students. In 
addition, the school participates in a state-wide bilingual essay competition open only to bilingual students. If the student wins 
then they are taken to to the  New York State Association for Bilingual Education (NYSABE) Conference where they read their 
essays and collect awards.  The parent coordinator, ENL teacher and homeroom teachers assist with these events. In addition 
the school hosts a Unity Day celebration where each class/ student gets the opportunity to celebrate and show-case their 
culture. The event is normally held in the schoolyard and is attended by all students.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

The language electives offered to ELLs are Spanish, French, Haitian Creole and Latin.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Content area can be delivered in the target language (English) or in the Native Language. However, the 
teacher is not allowed to switch back and forth between languages. If the lesson is being done in English 
then the teacher must provide a linguistic summary in the native language at the close of the lesson. The 
same is standard for the reverse, if the lesson is being done in the native language then a linguistic 
summary must be provided in English at the close of the lesson.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
-Professional Development will be provided to all staff to support the effective delivery of instruction. Our professional 
development for SY 2017-2018 will focus on the components of the curriculum: Math Power ENL (Math coach). The sessions 
will be conducted by the Math Coach, Mr Gilbert Torchon, who is certified in both the Bilingual and Common Branch areas. 
The Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP), located at Teachers College, Columbia University, has been a 
premier provider of professional development for schools in New York City, across the nation and internationally for almost 
three decades. Their mission is to support literacy instruction through research and professional development. Their research 
has tackled many subjects, including, of course, the teaching of reading and writing K-8, but also including methods of 
supporting large scale school reform, of coaching teachers, and of leading schools in which young people grow to be avid and 
skilled readers and writers. These sessions will be conducted by Ms. Judith- Duffus Campbell, (Assistant Principal), who is 
dually certified as an English and ENL Teacher.  Ms. Duffus-Campbell has also received TC training / workshops. 
The school provides all teachers with differentiated professional development twice per month. In 
addition teachers have common preparation periods in which further professional development is done.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The focus will be on helping / supporting teachers through these sessions, to integrate content area materials through hands-
on activities while students develop literacy skills and English language proficiencies through authentic and communicative 
language activities. Research has shown that teachers of ELLs require extensive support to expand their subject matter 
knowledge and knowledge of content specific teaching strategies so that their students can get a deeper understanding of 
content areas, develop academic and social language. (Garet et al., 2001: Kennedy, 1998) Our Bilingual /ENL programs and 
activities are guided by scientific based research, which has proved over time the effectiveness of Bilingual 
Education. Cummins (1989) has found that there is strong correlation between literacy in the native language and English 
acquisition.  Mr R. Jean-Marie (ENL Teacher/translator) will work with the teachers on using the native language to enhance 
student learning of the target language 
The school provides all teachers with differentiated professional development four times per month. In addition teachers have 
common preparation periods in which further professional development is done. The ENL teachers are required to hold 
workshops monthly. In addition they also offer workshop sessions during scheduled 
chancellor's PD Day.  
The designated professional development liaison is J.Duffus-Campbell. As such a professional development binder is kept 
which tracks and records all PDs done school-wide. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
New ELL parent orientation meetings are scheduled at the beginning and during the school year to familiarize parents with the 
school system and the different programs that are offered. A DVD on parent orientation by the Department of Education is 
shown to parents in their language, and parents have the opportunity to discuss the three program choices and complete the 
Parent Surveys and Program Selection forms.  Open -houses are scheduled throughout the year for parents of all 
students.  Bilingual parents are invited to come in at that time where they meet with the ENL teachers to discuss issues 
pertinent to the bilingual community. Bilingual parents are also invited and bussed by the school to the New York State 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73 

 

 

 

Association for Bilingual Education Conference (NYSABE). At this conference there is a session especially for bilingual parents.  
Transaltion for parents is provided by the staff. The front office has a fluent speakers of Spanish and Haitian Creole; while the 
teaching staff has proficient speakers of Haitian Creole, Spanish, French, Chinese, Bengali, Korean, Jamaican Creole and Urdu. 
All written correspondences is translated in Spanish, Haitian Creole and French. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Specific activities that foster ELL parent involvement are class trips, literacy and numeracy night, open-houses, NYSABE  and 
Unity Day.  They activities parents are invited in along with their students to participate in the event.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Berthe G. Faustin, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

School Records and Home Language identification Surveys (HILS) show that about 25% of PS 189 / The Bilingual 
Center student population consists of English Language Learners. Approximately 25% of PS 189 families are recent 
immigrants with limited English proficiency. Oral reports from the guidance office, the Parent Coordinator and the 
PTA president have also highlighted the need for language services to meet the needs of our multilingual 
community. During most school community meetings the need for and benefits of written translation and oral 
interpretation are often expressed by parents. P.S 189 works at developing a positive home school partnership in 
order to improve student learning outcomes. New ELL parents’ orientation meetings are scheduled during the 
school year to familiarize parents with the school system and the different programs that are offered. Parents are 
provided a general overview of the school programs in their dominant language. All parents are afforded the 
opportunities to dialogue on school policies, school and class expectations. Workshops are held in languages 
other than English to assist parents in understanding and interpreting the school and individual student data.

Being a linguistically and culturally diverse school population, PS 189 has a large number of Limite English Proficient 
parents. Meaningful parental engagement in the educational process and Chancellor’s Regulations require that 
school-related information be provided to parents in their home language. Research in the field of language has 
shown that, when information is provided to parents in the language they understand, their participation in the 
school’s life increases and students’ achievement improves significantly. Findings of school's written translation and 
oral interpretation needs were reported to the school community during various forums and school staff was 
informed of available services and required procedures to meet those needs
