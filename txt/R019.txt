Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

P.S.19, The Curtis School, nurtures and empowers tomorrow’s leaders so they can make a positive difference in the 
world while achieving personal and academic success. We provide our students with the opportunities necessary to 
achieve their personal best while they are learning to become responsible, productive citizens inspired to give back to 
the community. 

  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 19 is located in the Port Richmond community and takes pride in its diversity. As a Title 1 School wide program we 
serve approximately 500 students, across 25 classrooms ranging from Pre Kindergarten to 5th grade. 

All staff members are committed to developing leaders for the 21st century who will make the world a better place. 
For the upcoming school year we are adopting a school wide balanced literacy approach in English Language Arts 
subject areas and embracing teaching practices that develop conceptual understandings in Mathematics to ensure 
student readiness and success for their college and career years. 

P.S. 19 has a deep appreciation and respect of biculturalism and diversity. We pride ourselves with being responsive 
to the cultural and linguistic backgrounds of our students as well as meeting the needs of our most diverse learners. 
We proudly celebrate our Dual Language program which was identified as a model program by the DOE in the 2015- 
2016 school year. 

We have strong partnerships with community organizations that enrich and support students art and literacy 
experiences in order to guide them along the path to college. 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our student population is 71% Hispanic, 13 % African American, 7% Caucasian, 5% Asian and 5% of other ethnic 
groups. Within our population we provide quality mandated services for our English language learners (17%) and our 
students with disabilities (27%) 

Through the variety of specialized instructional programming offerings we reach our broad range of learners. Our 
programs include Dual Language classes (target language Spanish), ELL enrichment classes, and Specialty classrooms 
across Kindergarten- 5th grade. Our school specialty classrooms include Integrated Co-Teaching classes (ICT) on every 
grade and 5 self-contained classes which support the needs of students with a range of learning differences.  

Our school proudly serves over 75 mandated English Language Learners. Our ENL specialists and certified Bilingual 
teachers are experts in providing strategic support and targeted intervention that supports learning while students 
are acquiring a second language. Teachers work collaboratively in classrooms to support students in their classroom. 
Additionally, it is routine practice for all team members to pull strategic small groups to target and develop areas of 
need. 

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

This past school year we continued to make progress in: 

 

Strong Family-Community Ties: Establishing a home-school connection where parents became partners and 
joined us for a variety of learning opportunities throughout the school year. Data indicates an increase of 30% 
in the past two years. 

  Collaborative Teachers: Developing distributive leadership among teachers through collaborative planning, 
team meetings and inter-visitations. This work served to strengthen our instructional practices and improve 
student outcomes. Comparative data indicates an increase of .75 in our collaborative teacher score based on 
our NYC survey . 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

For the 2018-2019 school year we will focus on: 

  Rigorous Instruction: Tailoring our instructional practices to meet the needs of our diverse learners by 

 

adopting a school wide Balanced Literacy model which provides students with customized, inclusive, 
motivating instruction which is aligned to standards and will lead to an increase of our students reading levels. 
Supportive Environment : Establish and adopt a school wide framework for positive behavioral interventions 
and supports (PBIS) to strengthen and communicate our school community's core beliefs when it comes to a 
safe and nurturing learning environment which has high expectations for behaviors and academics.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Rigorous Instruction 

Data Analysis of the 2018 New York State Common Core English Language Arts Exam (ELA) revealed the following: 

 

Increase of 11 % for the all students category. 

Subgroup data of this same time period revealed : 

  5% increase of proficiency level for Students with disabilities 
  There was no increase of English Language Learners proficiency rate 

Data Analysis of the 2018 New York State English as as Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) revealed 
the following: 

  56% students made gains to next category of language proficiency  
  39% students made gains within the category but not enough to move to the next category 
  3% of students slipped back in performance within the proficiency level as the rigor of the assessment 

increased 

  1% of students slipped back into a lower level of proficiency as the rigor of the assessment increased 

 

Our Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project, TCRWP, running record data for the 2017 - 2018 school year 
revealed 

  99% of students moved up in reading levels 
  37% of students increased their performance band moving towards proficiency 
  49% of students stayed in the same performance band 
  8% of our students slipped back a performance band 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

In summary, our data demonstrated while our students are consistently making gains, moving up levels, many of 
them are not able to keep up with the movement demanded to meet the grade level standards. In order to address 
this issue we focus on improving the quality of reading instruction. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, as a result of small group instruction and conferring there will be a 5% increase in the percentage of 
students in grades 1-5 reading at or above grade level as measured by the end-of-year TC Assessment results. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Data from our 2017 - 2018 New York City School Survey revealed the following: 

 

Data Analysis demonstrating school strengths: 

  95.8% of parent responses to the survey was positive 
  97% of parents agree that at school their child is safe 
  83% of teachers say that adults see disruptive behavior as socio-emotional learning opportunities. 
  83% of teachers say that adults at their school teach students the skills they need to regulate their behavior 

 

Data Analysis demonstrating school needs: 

  45% of teachers say that students do not behave well in class when the teacher isn’t watching 
  36% of teachers expressed some concern about classroom behavior 
  27% of teachers expressed concern that students are not working hard to get good grades 
  69% teachers have influence over standards of student behavior. 

 

Our overall average rating is 6% below the district average in safety, 

A supportive environment is one where students feel safe, supported and challenged by their teachers and peers. The 
data trends highlighted above identify some shifts that need to be implemented. As such we will focus on reducing 
the number of infractions which impact a safe, supportive environment while developing leadership skills. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

Strategies to address students' needs: 

 

● Engage parents as active participants, contributors and cultural 
liaisons to the school community. 

 

● Share with parents and family members the high expectations 
that schools have established for the education of all students. 

 

● Collaborate with the school support personnel and immigrant 
community-based organizations in order to address the multiple 
needs of families of Ells. 

 

  Organize educational field trips to businesses within the 

community. 

Parent Involvement  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  PTA, & SLT to organize a Cultural Fair. 

  Arrange communications linking parents to cultural & 

community organization/events. 

  Open PTA Meetings with a mix and mingle so parents can 

develop a network between one another. 

  PTA will organize events for parents to socialize (adult 
after school activities) and initiate parent involvement 
throughout the school year. 

  Open forum at the end PTA meetings allowing parents to 

voice their opinions and needs for students. PTA can 
address the concerns and questions, which will be 
brought to the SLT team.

Over 95% of PS 19 teachers are highly qualified. We continue this work specifically to meet this goal by differentiated 
Professional Development offered to general education and special education teachers; content specialists and 
related service providers, 

● Professional Development during Mondays PLC time 

● Grade conferences 

● Unit Planning Grade Level Meetings - Classroom Teachers (multiple times a month) 

● NYCDOE and District PD opportunities: ongoing throughout the year 

● Peer Intra-visitations 

● Feedback based on observations 

● Assigned mentors for newly hired teachers 

● Recruitment from NYCDOE Human Resources. A selection committee will interview candidates and select best 
match to our schools’ needs 

● Collaboration with Wagner College and CSI Education Departments to have student teachers and to identify 
promising teacher candidates 

Recruitment strategies include hiring substitute teachers in order to verify their skills and suitability for teaching at PS 
19. If suitable, their names are retained on file, in the event of a vacancy. Liaison with network and local district 
colleagues to identify effective teachers who are searching for a new appointment. Unsolicited resumes are also kept 
on file and referred to when a vacancy occurs. Prospective teachers are asked to teach a lesson and attend a group 
interview. The panel consists of members of the administration team. Retention strategies include employing 
teachers who are on leave as F-status teachers, so that they can maintain contact with the school, and continue to 
develop their skills. At the end of the school year, a preference sheet is distributed. At this time teachers are

welcomed to apply for new positions. In addition they may share their requests for changes of position in order to 
further develop their skills. The administrative team makes the selection. So that as these teachers continue to 
develop their practice and may be placed in assignments where they can perform at their best, a preference sheet is 
distributed toward the end of the school year. New positions are made known at this time and teachers are invited to 
apply for those, and also to state their requests for changes of position in order to further develop their skills. The 
administration team makes the selection.

 

For Literacy and Math we have teacher teams who attend PD throughout the year and turnkey to staff during 
PD time slots 

  All teachers meet during common preps (at least once a week) to study student work, analyze trends and plan 
  Teachers and paras meet during Professional Learning Communities to refine skills in response to data trends 
  Our teachers facilitate monthly professional learning to their colleagues in focus area and will provide in-class 

supports for individual teachers as needed 

  Throughout the year, opportunities for professional development are offered to teachers particularly focusing 

on all curriculum areas especially Early Childhood, Special Education, English Language Learners, Science and 
Technology

P.S. 19R has established two full day PreK programs housed in the main school building. It is our goal to provide a 
program that meets young children’s needs for health, safety, and guidance for social-emotional development as well 
as providing opportunities for developmentally appropriate learning. 

Our PreK teachers and paras support transition to kindergarten by meeting with families in early spring. The teachers 
tour the building with the students in May of the school year to familiarize our young students with specific meeting 
areas, such as the auditorium, the cafeteria, the entrance and lobby. Also in June, the cluster teachers who provided 
instruction in the PreK classroom throughout the year escort the students to the cluster room such as Art, 
Technology, Science, Social Studies and Physical Education. This is an important aspect in the PreK student’s ability to 
adjust to transitioning from one location to another and the familiarity of the cluster teacher supports this 
adjustment. 

In the Spring (May/June) parents are invited to attend an informational session “Preparing My Child for 
Kindergarten”. During this workshop, parents are given information and materials aligned to the Common Core State 
Standards for kindergarten in letter/sound recognition, word work, reading, writing, math and the content areas. Our 
bilingual parent coordinator offers a schedule of parent workshops, not only throughout the year for all parents, but 
also PTA meetings. The PreK family worker and the teacher also schedule activities for PreK parents held within the 
classroom setting throughout the year. In September of each school year, a “Welcome Tea” is presented to parents 
hosted by the principal, parent coordinator and PreK/K teachers informing parents about school policies, activities 
and procedures. 

Professional development is ongoing and PreK teachers attend workshops through the school year on student non-
attendance dates (i.e. Work Sampling System) as well as any schoolwide professional development pertaining to the 
DOE, our network and PS 19’s initiative. 

Official records are kept in the office where the teacher for the upcoming school year reviews and consults the PreK 
teacher, if needed. The PreK teacher also informs the School Assessment Team if a child has an IEP, which is followed 
up by administration to ensure every child is getting services he/she needs. 

Contact is maintained throughout the year, with the local preschools by the Parent Coordinator. Additionally parents 
who attend the workshops and classes provided by the Parent Coordinator, often have preschool age children. They 
are effective conduits for informal information sharing. More formally, prior to the end of year, a Pre-school 
orientation visit occurs, at which the administrators meet the parents and children, they visit the classrooms, receive 
information and an invitation to a follow up workshop. This workshop is designed to show them and give them an 
opportunity to practice activities they can do with their child to prepare them for Kindergarten. A home pack is 
provided for the summer vacation. Parents of the children are invited to enroll before the year begins and to advise 
school personnel if special services are required for their child. In this way preparations can be made in a timely 
manner and ensure a smooth transition to elementary school. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
 

PS 19R has established an Instructional Team which includes administration and one teacher from every grade, 
Kindergarten through 5th grade. The purpose of this team is to discuss and pursue our instructional focus in 
accordance with Framework for Great Schools and the CEP. In this regard, the team will implement, model and 
turnkey to their grade colleagues the following: 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

  Based on learning goals, teachers will identify various solution pathways and anticipated challenges to plan 

assessments that check and deepen students’ understanding of challenging instructional tasks. 

  The Instructional Team members will decide on the collection data to be analyzed throughout the year and 

record within a specific timeframe. 

  The team will analyze and look for trends in the assessments which include the following; ELA (Running 

Records), Writing on-demand pieces, and math problem solving. These trends will impact grade level and 
classroom planning. 

  Team members will turnkey to their grade partners and results will be discussed at Instructional Team 

meetings and Professional Development timeslots through the year. 

 

 

After each specific assessment is administered, the Instructional Team members meet with their grade partners to 
review student work, adjust instruction based on student evidence and plan instruction according to student's’ needs 
based on the aforementioned assessment data. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46

State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 19, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 19 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;

activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

PS 19, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing 
a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, agree that this 
Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for improved academic 
achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure that all children 
achieve State Standards on assessments.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 
academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.

High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 
the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  
1. 

Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 
workshops and conferences.  

Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 
community needs.

These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

 •      When looking at our Running Record data, we noticed that 84% of our  Second Grade English 
Language Learners are reading at level F or below, placing them as Level 1 readers.  In order to supplement 
literacy for the aforementioned students, we will offer our After School Program: Enrichment 
Clusters.  Through the SEM model, students will receive support in the four language modalities: Reading, 
Writing, Listening and Speaking. This program is open to students in all bilingual programs in Grade 2 
whereby they receive support in literacy through enrichment clusters. 
•     PS 19 currently has 117 mandated English Language Learners, including former ELLs.  We have decided 
to invite our Third Grade students in Dual Language classes and English Language Learners, including 
former ELLs who tested proficient in 2016 & 2017.  
•     The SEM Enrichment After School Program will meet after school for 11 weeks from 2:45-3:45 on the 
following dates:   
November 14, 21, 28, 29; 30 
December 5, 6, 12, 13, 18, 20   
January 2, 3, 9, 10, 16, 17, 23, 24, 30, 31  
Invitation to our After School Program will be sent to Third Grade parents in both English and Spanish (and 
low incidence languages, as needed).  Attendance will be taken during each session and recorded on an Excel 
spreadsheet.  
•     The language of instruction is English. A teacher with bilingual certification will visit all 3 groups to 
support students whose home language is Spanish.  
•     The program is delivered by four teachers:  one certified bilingual teacher who speaks Spanish,  one 
Science teacher, and two special education teachers.  The program consists of three groups of 
students.  Students will be grouped according to their choice, as per the philosophy of the SEM cluster. The 
three program choices are: Robotics, Coding and Electrical Engineering.  Our bilingual teacher will spend 20 
minutes with each cluster. During this time, language skills will be enhanced as students discuss scientific 
processes with their peers and use content-specific language.  
•     Materials used for this program are supplemental and will not supplant direct instruction delivered in the 
classroom.  Materials that will be used are: 
- D cell batteries 
- permanent markers 
- Aluminum foil 
- trifold board 
- glue sticks 
- Alligator clips 
- free websites (code.org) 
- little bits robotics sets

As part of our mid-year check-in, the ENL teachers were asked in January to identify students that 
would benefit from a supplemental morning program.&nbsp; The students were selected based on: teacher 
observations of students, individual conferences, class participation and progress monitoring.&nbsp; The 
selected students will be invited to participate in the Title III- Tier 2 Morning Program.&nbsp;

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

Data analysis from OG and Estrellita enable us to target and provide students with center-based work to enhance their phonics 
skills. Teachers use this data to select Shared Reading texts and plan strategy lessons.   Data collected from Running Records is 
used to to strategically group students in Guided Reading groups.  
 
In Writing, student work is analyzed based on a rubric and instruction is targeted according to students' needs. General 
Education teachers work in collaboration with the ENL teachers to design interventions that are centered around language 
acquisition needs (grammar, syntax, vocabulary). 
 
In Math, data collected from unit assessments is used to inform how concepts will be revisited. Teachers collaborate to 
determine whether students are struggling with concepts or vocabulary and if support in their Home Language is needed.  
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

As a matter of practice P.S.19 teachers are always looking at student work in order to tailor instruction for our diverse 
learners. The results of their efforts result in flexible small groups, creation of supportive tools and scaffolds to ensure access 
to the content. 
 
Additionally, we have data collection systems which are accessible to teachers, service providers, and specialists. For all the 
literacy items listed above data is collected and analyzed by the data specialist. Reports generated are shared with the 
administration and with teacher teams to plan next steps, allocate resources and tailor professional learning so students’ 
needs can be met. 
 
For the upcoming school year, we will be maximizing on the following structures in order to continue to support meeting the 
needs of our ELLs: 
 
Ensuring there is at least one common grade level meetings a week where teachers of ELL students and ENL specialists meet to 
look at student work, discuss student progress and struggles and plan next steps in response to the noticings. 
 
Setting up data meetings with the data specialist or/an administration to point out trends that require action steps to be taken 
in classes where ELL students are not making gains 
 
Administrators will examine class data trends before doing classroom observations so we ensuring the appropriate supports 
are in place for students

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 
In order to progress monitor our ELLs in relation to Common Core Learning Standards and in comparison to their peers  in our 
school community we rely on the the following baseline/benchmark assessments: 
 
Reading 
TCRWP Running Records (3x a year) 
Writing 
On demand pieces graded on CCLS grade level rubric  (3x a year) 
Math 
Go Math Curriculum Assessments  (3 times per year) 
 
Spanish Language Arts (Dual Language Classrooms only) 
HLA Assessment (2 times per year) - grades 2-5 
 
The above assessments are all collected at the beginning of the year, a mid-year check in, and end of year assessment.  
 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Data collected is reviewed after every data collection cycle. Based on the data collected students are targeted for specific 
supports which include in-class targeted small group instruction, Morning program, after school and/or special program 
support such as Orton-Gillingham, Great Leaps or SPIRE. Additionally, ELL specialists may recommend additional strategies or 
methods to use with students. Data trends also guide next steps for professional learning. 
 
During the month of February (mid-year checkpoint), the administrative team holds Data Meetings with all teachers.  This 
ensures that: 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
As suggested by the RTI protocol, PS19 will follow the four main components: 
1. universal screening 
2. Strong Core Instruction 
3. Intensive Tailored Instruction 
4. Progress Monitoring 
 
During the screening process, students in need of support are identified.  
Our first implementation of support, consists of Tier 1 instruction in the classroom with the teacher who adjusts lessons 
implemented during the day and delivers supplemental lessons in small strategy grouping to the ELLs based on the specific 
skills needed. The teacher develops different key domains of literacy to support competencies in reading, writing, listening and 
speaking.  Special consideration is given to language proficiency in both languages. Additionally, the teacher presents 
instruction that makes direct connections to the ELLs’ values and culture. If we see that students are not making progress with 
Tier 1 supports a conversation with the ENL team and/or the grade level supervisor  takes place so that Tier II supports can be 
considered. 
 
As we proceed to Tier 2 intervention, our ENL team reviews the evidence based data and the instruction delivered in the 
classroom.  During the meeting a systematic process for examining the ELL student includes their cultural background, 
language proficiency in their native language and second language and the results of any of the aforementioned data is 
reviewed and a plan is created for the ELL student based on the diverse needs of the student as well as their strengths and 
weaknesses..  Instructional programming is this area may include a double dose on instruction, small group instruction with a 
specialist or a tailored type of program to begin (such as Great Leaps). Students given Tier II interventions are given an 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

 

additional baseline assessment that aligns with programmatic support they are to receive so we can progress monitor the 
outcome after 6 weeks. 
 
In the unlikely event, we have an ELL student who has still not made progress we will provide a four week cycle of Tier III 
intervention with an ELL or Special Education specialist before requesting an evaluation for special education. The final 
decision as to consider an evaluation for an ELL is made only after a thorough analysis of the student’s abilities after the above 
mentioned interventions have been implemented.  We are mindful and try to distinguish between a learning disability and 
language acquisition.  We have ENL teachers on our team to assist in this distinction.    
 
 
 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Currently, we lean on the results of the NYSESLAT to monitor student progress over time in the four modalities. 
Our data shows that our first graders are coming in at the Emerging and Transitioning levels. Beginning in Grade 2, we start 
seeing a shift, as students move up to the Transitioning and Expanding levels.  
When taking a closer look at the NYSESLAT results, we noticed our lower grade students are scoring low on the Listening part 
of the test. This data will help us make adjustments in the lower grades in order to address this gap. We have engaged our 
lower grade teachers in professional development that focus on key components of Balanced Literacy that promote listening 
and Speaking - such as Shared Reading and Interactive Read Aloud with Accountable Talk.  
When looking at the fifth grade data, there were no students who tested at the Commanding Level. We will pay special 
attention to our students who are at the Expanding Level to pinpoint areas of deficiency that need to be targeted.  
Additionally, we use ISR reports from the ELA and Math State tests to compare progress of our ELLs to their peers and 
determine if language is getting in the way of student growth and performance. When looking at the State tests, 93% of our 
English Language Learners are scoring at Level 1 and 2. These analysis, in conjunction with the ELL Data Analysis Tool support 
us in identifying strengths and struggles and "at risk" levels of groups of students. 
 
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Class data profiles are created by the data specialist and shared with the classroom teachers. This enables teachers to know 
early on who they need to monitor closely. Data from the EDAT is shared at a monthly team meeting so trends are identified 
and adjustments of curriculum can be made as needed. Additionally, data analysis enables us to identify students who may 
need a specific type of programming to meet their needs. 
Supervisors engage in data conversations with all teachers in the middle of the year. During the data meetings, we look at: 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

We have two full time ENL teachers in our school and one F-status teacher. Their programmed assignments are in 
accordance CR Part 154,  which requires them to deliver the units of study through a combination of Standalone and 
Integrated ENL.  Student grouping at the grade level of our ELLs are as follows: Our general education, heterogenous 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

 

ELL students are clustered in one class on each grade and our special ed ELLs are placed in accordance to their 
IEPs.  The general education classes of ELLs have less than 40% English language learners (heterogeneous) in the 
classroom which provides them with the on-going interactions with peers whose L1 is English. Entering and Emerging 
ELLs receive a combination of Standalone and Integrated ENL whereas the Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding 
will receive ENL instruction through integrated ENL. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Currently we do not have a TBE program, as parent selection forms do not warrant it. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

    Our Dual Language program spans from grades preK-5 and uses a roller coaster 50/50 model in grades PreK and K 
and 3-5. For Grades 1 and 2, we follow a side-by-side model. The Dual language Program delivers instruction 50% of 
the time in English and 50% in Spanish. Classes rotate instruction each day, one day in English, the next day in 
Spanish.  Our dual language pre-k has morning instruction in English and afternoon in Spanish. Our Dual Language 
teachers hold Bilingual Extensions and deliver ENL units of study within their dual language classrooms.   
In the classrooms that follow the roller coaster model, ENL minutes are delivered by the classroom teacher on English 
days by small group instruction during at least 3 periods a day. In our side-by-side classrooms, ENL minutes can be 
delivered by the English teacher who is able to carry out flexible groupings and service students from both 
classrooms. Integrated instruction takes place throughout the day and students receive home language support every 
other day. The standalone component is done through small grouping. 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 
In the ENL classes, the mandated instructional minutes are supported by the three ENL teachers.  The school schedule consists 
of seven 50 minute periods a day.  The ENL teachers will deliver 2 units of study to Entering ELLs (1 unit through Standalone 
and 1 unit through Integrated).  For Emerging students, teachers will deliver half a unit through standalone, and 1.5 units 
through Integrated). Entering and Emerging students will received a total of 360 minutes per week. Transitioning and 
Expanding students will receive 1 unit of Integrated ENL for a total of 180 minutes per week.  Commanding students will 
receive a total of 90 minutes integrated instruction per week. As specified, the ENL teacher will push-in to a content area 
teacher for Transitioning and Expanding students for a total of 180 minutes per week.  Commanding students will receive half 
a unit (90 minutes) of ENL through an Integrated model during ELA. 
For example, an Emerging student will receive ENL instruction for a total of 360 minutes per week. That student will receive a 
total of 180 minutes of stand alone instruction as well as another 180 minutes of integrated instruction. Our three ENL 
teachers speak Spanish and the students’ home language is supported through literature, word to word glossaries, bridging 
strategies and writing in the home language. 
 
Our dual language classrooms follow a two week cycle.  On week A, students receive 3 days of English instruction and 2 days in 
Spanish.  On week B, students receive 3 days in Spanish and 2 days in English.  On week B, instruction is delivered in English for 
two days.  Teachers provide ENL instruction for a minimum of 4 periods a day.  This includes Reading, Writing, Math and a 
content area of choice (either Science or Social Studies).  The teachers differentiate instruction and have small ENL groups on 
each level according to the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL proficiencies.  ELA instruction is also incorporated into the daily schedule 
through reading, writing, word work and math time blocks.  The time block for literacy consists of 135 minutes daily.On week 
A,  students receive ENL instruction 3 days a week, therefore exceeding the mandated units. Home Language is supported 
extensively on Spanish days, as all content areas are delivered in the target language the entire day. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Students receive ELA instruction through a Balanced Literacy approach, with mini-lessons aligned to the Common Core 
learning standards. The literacy block is supplemented by several key components of balanced literacy including Interactive 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

Read Alouds, Shared Reading, Guided Reading and Strategy Grouping. Special attention is given to vocabulary instruction; prior 
to delivering a lesson, vocabulary is introduced and practiced. 
The content areas are taught by the classroom teachers of ELLs with ENL teachers pushing in for the mandated minutes, during 
the literacy block and also during math, science and social studies.  All students receive an extra period of science and social 
studies through theater once during the week from a cluster teacher.  These teachers also receive support from the ENL push-
in teacher, depending on the proficiency level.  These content teachers receive professional development from our ENL 
teachers and coordinator as well as attending workshops offered for ELLs in the content areas when available.  The content 
teachers meet with the ENL teachers to discuss the proficiency of all ELLs they teach, and create small group work when 
applicable.  The content area teachers give a glossary of word to word terms to students and also post words in both English 
and Spanish, and for low incidence languages a glossary in Science, Social Studies and Math is distributed for student and 
parent reference.  ELLs, whose native language is Spanish, also receive a Science, Math and Social Studies text in Spanish to 
use alongside the English text.  This also provides support for parents.  Content teachers and classroom teachers all attend 
workshops pertaining to teaching the English language learner and one of the important strategies is to use visuals and 
pictorials for deeper comprehension.  There is also a component in our Science, Math and Social Studies program, aligned to 
the Common Core Learning Standards that specifies differentiation for ELLs.  Every teacher of ELLs uses this resource to modify 
lessons accordingly.   
  
The dual language classroom teachers teach the content areas in the classroom in both Spanish and English (50/50).   
  
In Kindergarten, First and Second Grade, literacy and math units are taught in a sequential manner, with one day being taught 
in English and the next day in Spanish.   Again, literacy instruction is enhanced through interactive Read Alouds with 
accountable talk, Guided Reading and small strategy groups. All dual language students have textbooks in math, social studies 
and science in Spanish and English.   
  
Dual language third, fourth and fifth graders alternate a unit/lesson, also aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards.  For 
example, one unit or lesson (depending on length) is taught entirely in English, and the following unit or lesson is taught 
entirely in Spanish.  The reason for this is to build comprehension and deepen knowledge of the content.  However, when a 
science or social studies unit is taught in Spanish, the topic of that particular unit is enhanced through Read Aloud texts in 
English on the English day and when a unit is taught in English, the Read Aloud texts are read in Spanish focusing on the same 
topic, on the Spanish day. Grade meetings and professional development are scheduled with teachers, including content 
teachers, to plan, assess and evaluate units and lessons for all students, including specific strategies for ELLs. Lessons are 
enhanced by the use of manipulatives; drawings, writing, speaking and technology.  English language learners benefit from the 
variety of methods and approaches teachers use to accentuate lessons.   
  
The Science curriculum corresponds to the NYC scope and sequences and is embedded in the Common Core State 
Standards.  Teachers and students engage in enduring experiences that lead to deeper understanding of the natural world.  All 
students observe, describe, sort and organize objects, organisms, materials and simple systems.  The program incorporates 
English language learner links to enhance each science lesson for the students.  The Social Studies curriculum also corresponds 
to the NYC scope and sequence and the Common Core State Standards.  Teachers attend professional development through 
the school district on the units taught for each grade.   
  
The methods used to deliver the curriculum include, but are not limited to, project based learning, investigative independent 
model, role playing, teacher and student modeling and technology.  Prior knowledge, compare and contrast, research 
procedures, note-taking, self-monitoring, questioning, class trips, problem solving and procedural skills are some of the 
learning strategies incorporated for social studies. When front-loading vocabulary, words are introduced, practiced and 
displayed in both languages. 
 
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

PS 19 ENL teachers administer the NYSITELL within the first 10 days of registration.  If a student speaks Spanish, the ENL 
teacher administers the Spanish LAB.  Our ENL teachers also speak Spanish which ensures understanding of the Spanish 
LAB.  The assessment is recorded and processed which determines the level of native language proficiency for the student.   
Our dual language ELLs are evaluated in their native language as follows:  K, 1st and 2nd use Estrellita throughout the entire 
year to assess letter sounds and decoding skills. All students (ELLs in dual language) are administered running records from the 
Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment in Spanish three times a year to determine their reading level and comprehension 
in Spanish. Students in grades 2-5 take the HLA at the beginning and end of year to monitor growth in Spanish. ELLs that are 
not in dual language and are in a monolingual class with ENL support receive support in their native language through the ENL 
provider.  The ENL teacher provides texts in their native language and if the child only speaks Spanish, the child, if able, writes 
in their native language. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
Instruction for English language learners is differentiated by incorporating language objectives and functions of language such 
as describing, explaining, identifying, sequencing, planning comparing and predicting.  Students are organized into small 
groups with the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher facilitating student learning.  Students are encouraged to use cognates 
from their native language to make connections.   
  
a)    Presently our school does not have any SIFE students; however we have established a plan in the event that a SIFE student 
registers at our school.  The plan is as follows:  PS 19 will incorporate intervention and emotional support from our guidance 
counselor, social worker, psychologist and parent coordinator to meet the needs of the student and family.  SIFE students will 
receive the mandated number of minutes per week of ENL instruction based on their proficiency level and in accordance with 
the NYS CR Part 154.  We will provide the students with supplementary reading intervention program based on their reading 
needs during the day, which will be in addition to their ENL services. Programs that will be utilized are Award Reading, Raz 
Kids, Reading A to Z.  SIFE students will be given a peer-partner student to familiarize them with the school building, rules and 
regulations.  Parents of SIFE students will meet with the bilingual parent coordinator to inform them of the opportunities 
available to them at school and in our community.  Our ENL teacher will meet with the parent and child for an initial interview 
and provide a parent orientation session for parent option.  The ENL teacher will also check in with the SIFE student(s) daily in 
the morning to assure that they feel comfortable and ease the adjustment.  These students would also be invited to our Title 
III program. 
  
b.)    The ELLs in our school that are here less than three years (newcomers) receive the mandated number of minutes per 
week of ENL instruction based on their proficiency level and in accordance with the NYS CR 154. They will receive constant 
exposure to vocabulary and literacy instruction using a variety of manipulatives and visual representation.  The teachers of 
these students have a “Newcomer Kit” in their classroom with pictorial representations and words in English/Spanish/Arabic to 
represent any educational functions they may encounter within the school setting.   
  
c.)   Our 4-6 year ELLs receive the mandated number of minutes per week of ENL instruction based on their proficiency level in 
accordance with the NYS CR Part 154.  Within the mandated instructional time, these students receive small group instruction 
in reading/writing/word work, which has been identified as an area that needs improvement.  Reading support is implemented 
by small group planning focusing on the student’s individual reading needs.  ENL teachers provide support by using graphic 
organizers, visuals, hands on activities, sentence starters, oral skills to assure comprehension of the task is attained. Writing 
goals are created for this subgroup with emphasis on grammar, using Writing Fundamentals for Grammar, pre writing, creating 
paragraphs, topic sentences, sentence structure and revising and editing.  These students are also invited to the Title III, 
Saturday Program, focusing on speaking, listening, reading and writing activities.   
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

d.)   Long term ELLs will receive the mandated number of minutes per week of ENL instruction based on their proficiency level 
and in accordance with NYS CR Part 154.  We will provide these students with a supplementary intervention program (Tier II) 
to support their reading and writing needs based on their levels.  Supplementary intervention programs that will be utilized 
are: Award Reading, Fundations; Wilson; Easy English News: Empire State NYSESLAT.  Once again, they are invited to our Title 
III Program. 
  
e.)   Our former ELLs who have reached Commanding level in NYSESLAT continue to receive half a unit ENL instruction for two 
years. After the second year of reaching proficiency, the ENL teacher meets with administration and decides which class the 
student should be in for the upcoming school year and if they still would benefit from ENL push in services with advanced 
students.  Additionally, they receive accommodations on all NY state tests for two years.  Once again, these students are 
included and invited in our Title III program for ELLs. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
PS 19 offers the following instructional materials to support ELLs for academic content and English language development: 
Grade level literature and classroom leveled libraries (the ENL classroom has a large collection of literature, organized 
according to reading levels, themes, genres and subject matter).  ELL students are encouraged to read and borrow books, 
according to their interest level or particular subject being studied in the classroom.  Bilingual glossaries in various languages 
are available in all content areas, in the classroom as well as the ENL classroom.  They are also used to prepare for specific 
citywide and state tests, such as the NY State Math and Science tests, as well as supporting students in their classroom 
instruction.  Raz-Kids; Reading A to Z;  are all technology components based on reading levels, texts are read to students, or 
students can read the text and answer subsequent questions pertaining to the text read.  Award Reading is also an electronic 
reading program which reads aloud to students as they follow along which encourages and teaches reading in a non-stressful 
and risk free atmosphere.  Moby-Max is a home connection that supports students in Language and Math. Harcourt Science 
and Social Studies texts can also be read on the computer with and ENL component in every lesson.  Each classroom has also 
been provided with an iPad with a wide selection of educational apps. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
As per the amendments to CR Part 154, ENL teachers will provide units of study through a combination of standalone and 
integrated instruction.  We have two ENL teachers, one for kindergarten through second and the other supports third through 
fifth grades.  The ENL teachers have a common prep once a week with each grade to meet and plan lessons with the classroom 
teacher, including our special ed teachers in both ICT classes and self contained in order to develop instructional plans aligned 
to the curriculum for our ELLs with disabilities.   The ENL teacher provides ENL strategies for small group instruction aligned to 
the lessons and continues to support the student’s home language.   
 
All ENL teachers are included in curricular planning and instructional meetings and professional development that are provided 
for all instructional staff.  All content curriculums: Balanced Literacy; GoMath; Science and Social Studies have components 
adaptable for students with disabilities.  The classroom teacher and ENL teacher review these modifications and implement 
them during the instruction.  Our ENL teachers have access to IEP’s of the students they serve.  During the common prep, the 
ENL teachers collaborate with the teacher focusing on the IEP goals and modifying lessons to accommodate the student.   
 
Our School Based Support Team relies on the support of a bilingual psychologist, and a our in-house bilingual IEP special 
education teacher so when a student is referred for an evaluation, the team meets with the parent to discuss the least 
restrictive environment for the child while aligning the best placement for the child, which could be SETSS, ICT or self-
contained.  If the child's recommendation is to receive SETSS, this is a pull-out model for a specific time and group as indicated 
in the IEP; if the ELL student with disability is placed in the ICT class, the ratio is 60% general ed 40% special ed students.  The 
ELL student with disability placed in an ICT class would be integrated for the entire school day with non disabled peers and the 
ENL teacher would provide support for the required mandated minutes.  If the ELL child is in a self-contained special ed 
classroom as determined by the SAT team that the student needs this placement, the ENL teacher also pushes into that 
classroom for the mandated units.  The ELLs-SWDs in self contained classrooms are integrated during lunch, recess,

assemblies, and school-wide functions including all afterschool activities.  ELLs-SWD are also invited and attend the Title III 
program with non disabled ELLs. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 
PS 19 provides intervention for ELLs in ELA, Math and other content areas daily. Classroom implemented RTI Tier I strategies 
are implemented in the classroom setting by the classroom teacher and the ENL support teacher in small differentiated groups 
as per needed by specific skill. English language learners receive explicit combined language and literacy instruction, 
concentrating on the direct teaching of skills and strategies in a way that makes visible the processes of effective readers & 
mathematicians. The focus of these Tier I interventions are based on decoding, or comprehension skills for ELA, aligned to the 
Common Core Learning Standards for the grade and also for Math, aligned to the CCLS.  In Tier I RTI the focus of the 
interventions represents the core instructional program presented in the classroom.   
Based on data (teacher’s observation, formative tests, running records), the ELLs are grouped according to their specific needs 
based on three critical areas to assess reading:  students’ backgrounds and characteristics; text processing; and text 
comprehension.  The classroom teacher collaborates with the ENL teacher and plans instruction from a skill and strategy 
perspective after analyzing data from the above three critical areas. Intervention instruction is then planned and implemented 
in the classroom setting by both the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher.    In order to ascertain interventions for math, the 
teacher together with the ENL teacher analyze the assessments from each unit in GoMath and the performance tasks and 
based upon this data, devise an instructional plan to support the specific mathematical skills that our ELLs struggle with.  Other 
data that teachers analyze are: NYS tests in ELA, Math and Science (4th and 5th graders; NYSESLAT /LAB-R scores (K-5th); 
running records (K-5th); performance tests (K-5th).  Based on unit tests in Science and Social Studies, the classroom teacher 
determines what skills need further support and with the ENL teacher, provides this first step in intervention within the 
classroom setting.   
  
As a follow up to Tier I interventions, if our ELLs are still struggling after a specified time frame and the above steps have been 
carried out, a Tier II intervention plan is devised with the teachers and administration.  The Tier II plan focuses on more 
targeted services in smaller group settings and is provided in addition to the instruction in the classroom.  Progress is 
monitored more closely, at least bi-weekly, and the research-based interventions may last from six to twelve weeks.  This Tier 
II intervention is a pull-out, small group meeting with a teacher who focuses for the six to twelve weeks on a specific skill.  This 
“smaller” group-individualized instruction promotes accelerated growth with the following practices:  engaging in meaningful 
text for a major portion of the session; the reading material used for instruction is culturally relevant; the reading material is 
assessable; group sizes are small; and assessment is used to plan, differentiate and revise the instruction.  Similar steps are 
taken for math, science and social studies based on the CCLS as per grade.   
  
For students who do not adequately respond to the targeted services and interventions in Tier II, intensive interventions would 
be provided, in small groups or individually to address ELLs’ deficits.  Additional testing may also be warranted.  Only after Tier 
III interventions prove ineffective or inadequate would eligibility for specialized services under IDEA be considered.   
Home language of the ELL student is also taken into consideration.  Many times, ELLs are perceived as having a disability when 
the student is still struggling with language acquisition.  This consideration is brought to the School Based Support Team, who 
are bilingual (Spanish) and the team assesses the student in the home language, if Spanish.  If an ELL student with a low 
incident language is under consideration for intervention, a request is made for an interpreter at the time of student testing so 
the proper outcomes are reached for the student.  If it is determined that the student is struggling due to language, the 
student will not be placed in any special ed program, but will receive Tier I and Tier II intervention, specifically planned for that 
student. 
  
Specific programs used for Tier II and Tier III interventions include Orton-Gillingham, SPIRE and  Great Leaps Literacy. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72 

 

 For the upcoming school year our intention will be to continue to partner with Marquis Studios, through the potential grant, 
to continue to develop and support language and literacy. We will also be targeting the ELLs in the first and second grades, 
including students in ENL, Dual Language and ICT classes for additional intervention in the form of a morning program. 
Additionally, we will maximize the use of Sanford-Harmony which is a social emotional program which also builds language 
skills. In meeting the needs of our ELLs in mathematics I-Ready and Dreambox Learning will be considered. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Presently, we will not close any programs. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
English language learners are offered equal access to all school programs by invitation, recommendations and purposeful 
request.  After school and supplemental programs take place during the school year.  As part of our After School Title III 
program, our ELLs participated in Enrichment Clusters that included robotics, coding and computer science. This past school 
year, we were selected to participate in Disney’s Annie for Kids. This production, was supported by English Language Learners 
in learning and rehearsing the script. All our ELLs (including former ELLs) are invited to our Title III program.  PS 19 also offers 
an after school community based program, “Virtual Y”, which our ELLs students are  invited to. These programs offer 
homework assistance and various content area activities, which includes trips, social studies, science and performance 
arts.  Staff members from our school work for the program and support the needs of our students. Our ELLs actively participate 
in all our program, including our Saturday Enrichment Clubs.  PS 19 provides opportunities for all students, including ELLs in 
order to achieve their personal best, become responsible productive citizens and embrace lifelong learning in a safe and 
nurturing environment. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 
The ENL team leans on the core materials provided in the school’s adopted programs As specialist they provide students will 
scaffolds to access the content. 
  
Our team is exploring the use of the Language Progressions to determine the right support for their stage of language 
proficiency.  During our monthly ENL team meeting, two of our teachers trained in SIOP (ENL and Dual Language teacher) 
trained the rest of the team on writing clear language objectives to support students in different ways. For our Entering and 
Emerging students and ELLs with IEPs, we offer structured support in phonics through the use of Orton-Gillingham strategies 
and the Words Their Way phonics program.   
  
Technology for these groups includes apps on the ipad to support language acquisitions as well as videos with songs and 
chants.  For our students at the Transitioning and Expanding level, we offer technology-based programs such as Award 
Reading, RAZ Kids, Reading A to Z and Discussions for Learning.  Students at the Commanding level also use these programs in 
addition to Reader’s Theatre, Time for Kids and Easy English for ELLs. 
  
Content area clusters support our ELLs through the use of manipulatives, explicit vocabulary instruction and technology 
(videos, apps). Social Studies units are enhanced through field trips, videos and Project Based learning, where students learn 
content-specific vocabulary. 
  
In our dual language classrooms, where 50% of instruction is delivered in Spanish, students are also presented with videos, 
literature and apps in Spanish. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is delivered in the Dual Language program in a 50/50 model.  Students receive instruction in both 
English and Spanish in all content areas.  In the 50/50 model, students have the opportunity to receive home language support 
and are immersed in either a day of English and Spanish in all content areas (Grades 1-5) and half-day immersion for 
kindergarten.  Leveled books in Spanish, math, science and social studies texts are available in Spanish for the dual language 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73 

 

students.  Students in monolingual classes, who speak Spanish also, have the availability of these texts (Grades K-5), if needed, 
or for parent use.  Students who speak other languages such as Arabic and Urdu, have literature in the classroom to provide 
native language experiences and celebrate school wide diversity.  Additionally, in the Title III program for ELLs, a Read Aloud is 
always used for instruction and read in both English and Spanish, and if possible another language (depending on availability of 
an interpreter, or parent).  ELLs in both dual programs and monolingual programs with ENL support are encouraged to look for 
cognates when looking at English text. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required service support and resources are both grade and age appropriate for our ELLs aligned to the Common Core State 
Standards.  All students are assessed on an on-going basis and are presented with the necessary materials, instruction and 
environment to receive high quality education.  Both formal and informal assessments take place through the year in order for 
the classroom teachers, ENL, SETTS, Guidance Counselors and speech teachers to support all English language learners.  These 
specialists attend professional development offered in our school and outside and meet with the teachers of ELLs to obtain a 
full picture of the the whole child. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
DOES NOT APPLY. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our goal is to ensure that parents are well informed of the programs offered at PS19 and ways that they can be involved.  We 
provide support to the parents’ of ELLs at the beginning of the school year by holding information sessions, parent orientations 
and by providing them with a school handbook which is available in Spanish and English. Our school guidance counselor is 
fluent in Arabic as well as one of our paraprofessionals and both part of the team that welcomes our Arabic speaking parents 
to the school. When a new student is enrolled in our school, and if they are ELL student in the earliest stages of language 
acquisition they are buddied up with a student and checked in on by the guidance counselor to ensure they are acclimating to 
the school. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Using our Title III programming, we offer support in both Spanish and English to all our ELLs, including our former 
ELLs.  Although majority of our ELLs speak Spanish, the dual language program offers them the opportunity to read and write 
and learn math, science and social studies in their native language. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

 
For the 2017/2018 academic school year, our Dual Language program will be operating from grades pre 
K-5. 
  
a.) PS19 primarily uses the rollercoaster model with Spanish as our target language in self contained 
classes.  In grades K through 5th, one full day is in Spanish and the next day is English, alternating each 
day.  Our pre-k class runs in English in the morning and Spanish in the afternoon. 
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74 

 

 

b.)  Our dual language programs English proficient and English language learners are integrated 100% of 
the time in self contained classes.  All content areas are taught in both languages alternating 
days.  English language learners are given additional ENL mandated minutes during the Spanish day for 
literacy in order to meet their required needs.   
  
c.) Language is separated for instruction only during cluster periods  These instructional periods (one time 
per week) are delivered in English since cluster teachers deliver this instruction and only speak English. 
  
d. ) Both languages (English and Spanish) are taught at the same time simultaneously in our dual language 
program for emergent literacy.  We do notice that our ELLs are more successful in Spanish literacy and 
our English proficient students are more successful in English literacy. 
  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The Department of English Language Learners and Student Support offers many opportunities for our teachers of ELLs and our 
ENL teachers aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards.  We schedule our teachers for this training while hiring 
substitutes for the classroom. These teachers will then turnkey information to the staff at the next faculty meeting and also 
during a common grade meeting for each grade on the following week. Our ENL team also reads and discusses the research 
brief: Literacy and ELLs downloaded from the DOE website and devises a plan to implement the ideas to the staff throughout 
the year.  They are encouraged to explore the content on the DOE website such as the video series on RTI strategies for ELLs 
found under the “Educator Resources”. Teachers will receive their required professional development hours through a 
combination of in-house sessions as well as off-site workshops. 
 
The in-house sessions are held during PLC time on Mondays when the ENL Specialty team meets. .    
ENL professional development is scheduled and delivered by the Assistant Principal, ENL teachers and any teacher that has 
received a specialized training in a language-related topic.   Our ELL paraprofessionals also participate in these 
workshops.  Topics that have been turn-keyed this year include: 
 
Our bilingual parent coordinator attends workshops and does outreach in order to better serve the parents in our 
community.   
The assistant principal oversees all the programs for ELLs (ENL and Dual Language) and schedules specific workshops for ENL 
teachers and teachers of ELLs, focusing on explanation of the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT modalities; programs (dual language, TBE 
and ENL); modifying lessons to accommodate ELLs. We are working in conjunction with the Office of ELLS to register our ENL 
and DL language teachers to meaningful professional development sessions. 
Additionally, our teachers have a common prep at least once a week  and our ENL teachers have a common prep with each 
grade they support once a week. Twice a month each grade meets for inquiry meetings to analyze student work, look for 
trends and develop lessons to implement for student improvement using specific strategies for our ELLs. Election Day 
(November) and Chancellor’s day provide further time to explore these topics through professional development. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75 

 

 

As per the new CR Part 154.2, 15% of professional development hours (about 5.25 hours) for all teachers will be dedicated to 
language acquisition, best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs.  All 
dual language and ENL teachers will receive 50% of their professional development hours (about 17.5 hours) on these focus 
areas as well. 
PD will be delivered through a combination of in-house and off-site workshops.  In-house PD will take place during Monday PD 
time. 
The assistant principal will keep a log to ensure that all teachers meet the required amount of hours. Records will be kept 
through agendas and attendance sheets that will be stored in the binder of critical documents.   Once a month, a period is 
dedicated to ENL workshops for our teachers to analyze data, predict trends, turnkey information, and RTI for ELLs, always 
focusing on improving student achievement for our ELLs.   When a new teacher is employed or transferred from another 
school, PS 19 arranges to have the teacher attend at least one outside venue for an ENL workshop and provides in house 
professional development to meet the requirements.  The teacher maintains a record of his/her hours of ENL training and a 
certificate of the professional development is placed in the teacher’s file, located in the main office in a locked file cabinet.  In 
September, notification is sent to all staff reminding them of the requirements of the ENL training and a list of available 
professional development opportunities that are offered. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In addition to parent-teacher conferences and mandated parent orientations for parents of ELLs, classroom teachers will meet 
with parents of ELLs once during the year to discuss progress in language development, language proficiency assessment 
results and language development needs.   
Teachers also make themselves available during Tuesday Parent Engagement time. In order to support teachers during these 
important conferences, teachers will receive NYSESLAT scores and proficiency levels.  During the time when these conferences 
are held, the 3 ENL teachers and the assistant principal will be available to offer interpretation services.  Teachers have also 
been advised to use the Translation and Interpretation unit to assist them during conferences. Teachers will record this 
conference as “ELL conference” along with the date on the student’s cumulative folder.     

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

ELL parents are invited to be part of the Parent/Teachers Association, which has bilingual officers and interpreters 
available.  Additionally, we have parents of ELLs on our School Leadership Team and they get the opportunity to voice their 
concerns and opinions to the administration.  We also conduct a Parent Survey during Parent Teacher conferences so PS 19 
can get feedback on issues concerning our parents.  Our Title III Program is a literacy program where parents of ELLs 
participate alongside their child(ren) to complete activities aligned to the Common Core State Standards.   
Our dual language classes (pre k-5) offer parental workshops for parents of English proficient students to support the learning 
of the target language and for parents of Spanish speaking students to support the learning of English and in some areas the 
native language.  PS 19 offers ENL classes for all parents four mornings each week which are attended by many.  Our bilingual 
parent coordinator offers a variety of workshops customized to the needs of our community. We also have a phone messaging 
service in English and Spanish which is sent to parents reminding them of specific dates and activities.  PS 19 offers workshops 
for parents teaching how to access student information on the computer  and our website..  Our PTA offers snacks to our 
students at lunchtime twice a week and bilingual parents support the  snack stations.  During Parent/Teacher conferences, all 
teachers are provided with an interpreter to accommodate the parent’s native language.  Throughout the school year, our 
bilingual parent coordinator offers parent workshops focusing on topics such as:  medical and health insurance; fire safety; 
community based support organizations (COSTCO).  PS 19 also hosts an information session on testing for ELA, Math, Science, 
NYSESLAT, for parents and the support they can give for student achievement in both English and Spanish.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lynette Cartagena, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Based on the Home Language Survey of non English speaking parents, the parent indicates if they prefer notices 
sent home in their native language. If they prefer all information and notices sent home in their native language, 
any DOE notices are printed in multiple languages and the classroom teachers of ELLs are given a list of students 
who prefer communication in the native language. We have also looked at ATS reports of Preferred Language 
(RCPL and RAPL) as well as the blue cards.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

one bilingual Social Worker and 3 
bilingual ENL teachers. In addition, we 
have several paraprofessionals that are 
also bilingual (Spanish) and are 
assigned as translators.  

The Guidance Counselor and one of our 
paraprofessionals are bilingual in Arabic 
and are able to assist with this 
language.  

For all other languages, we rely on the

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          83 

 

 

In the event of an emergency, the school is able to send out a phone blast through school messenger in 3 languages: 
English, Spanish, and Arabic. We rely on the DOE's interpretation services for low incidence languages. Additionally, as 
suggested by the FSC, we encourage families to register on Notify NYC in order to receive alerts in their preferred 
language in case of a school or local emergency.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

In September, during faculty meeting, teachers are made aware of the A-663 regulation and provided with a 
"Language Packet" that includes the regulation as well as how to access the DOE's over-the-phone interpretation 
services. The LAC (Language Access Coordinator) is identified to the staff. 

 

The staff is also familiarized with "The Parent's Guide to Language Access" in order to identify any low incidence 
language spoken by our families.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Aligned with chancellors Regulations A-633: 

a. The school determines within 30 days of student enrollment the primary languages spoken by the parent of each 
student enrolled. The school further determines whether the parent requires language assistance for communication. 
As per determination, the school provides translation services to those in need. This determination is based on the 
parent interview with the ESL teacher. 

b. Data is recorded and maintained in ATS, in students' cumulative records and in the ELL files and on students' 
emergency cards. 

c. Parents are given copies of the Bill of Parents Rights and Responsibilities and are available at  

http://schools.nyc.gov/RulesPolicies/ParentBillofRights/default.htm  

d. Parent's Guide to Language Access is posted in the lobby, outside Parent Coordinator's office and Main Office.

Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We have planned several workshops and meetings throughout the year with our Dual Language and ELL parents. One 
way that we assess parent satisfaction is by having conversations with our parents. Parent feedback on the quality 
and availability of our services will also be assessed with a parent satisfaction survey, We understand that parents of 
students who are not ELLs may also need language accommodations. In order to ensure that their needs are being 
satisfied, our language access coordinator, Mr. Felix, meets with parents regularly to gauge the satisfaction of our 
services. These conversations take place during Welcome Back night, Parent Teacher Conferences and parent 
engagement time on Tuesdays.
