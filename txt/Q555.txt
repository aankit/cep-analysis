Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Newcomers High School was founded in 1995 as a school for immigrant students who are also English language 
learners with the mission of providing them with rigorous academic instruction, supporting them to achieve English 
language proficiency and easing their transition to new city, country, and culture. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Our school currently enrolled 832 students who are newly-arrived immigrants. We have a dedicated staff, Parent-
Association, School Leadership Team, and Student Organization committee who play an essential role in our decision 
making process. They have strong participation in meetings throughout the school year . The following are some 
programs and events offered at Newcomers High School aligned with our mission: 

● The Orientation Program provides support to our newly admitted students in getting to know the school while 
familiarizing them with school routines, instructional requirements and expectations. 

● The Seminar Program is a unique part of the students’ weekly program of required courses. It provides them with 
additional instructional and socio-emotional support, academic intervention services, and the opportunity to take part 
in selective mini-courses in academic subjects as well as in the arts. 

● Advanced Placement courses are offered in Calculus, Chemistry, United States Government & Politics, Spanish 
Literature, Spanish Language, English Language Composition, and Chinese Language. These are very rigorous courses 
and we have expanded the number of courses as well as the subjects in the last five years.  

● Arts instruction at Newcomers High School is of high quality. Our music programs include an orchestra class, chorus 
class, and required courses. We also offer studio art classes where students have the opportunity to express 
themselves through the arts with a focus in celebrating our diversity of many cultures around the world represented 
in our school community. 

● We have partnerships with theater and drama organizations such as Manhattan Theater Club, Lincoln Center 
Theater (Learning English and Drama), and Repertorio Español. The purpose of these partnerships is to have resident 
artists work with teachers and students to infuse theater and drama as tool for English language acquisition. 

● The partnership with Junior Achievement and Met Life offers students the opportunity to develop skills in business 
organization, computer applications, and applied economics. This year, our students made it to the finals of the JA 
Business Plan Competition in New York City. 

● The New Teacher Induction program includes a series of seminars, a buddy system, mentoring with Ms. Diane 
Giorgi, who trained with the Lehman College New York City Writing Program. During the seminar, new teachers have 
the opportunity of being coached by a well-experienced staff member. Teachers have the opportunity to take 
walkthroughs around the building to learn how to navigate our building. Also, they are introduced to internal 
practices in: ELL Compliance, Inquiry based instruction, Differentiation for sub-groups within the group of ELLs, 
Technology in the classroom, review of the CCLS in their content area and Data analysis of the school. 

● For the last few years we have provided teachers with professional development on the use of technology in the 
classroom. We continue to offer training on the use of various instructional software programs, as well as on the use 
of smart boards, graphing calculators, and audiovisual technology. 

● In partnership with LaGuardia Community College we offer College Now courses in Astronomy, Biology, Global 
Politics, Literacy and Propaganda, Speech and Communication, Statistics, Reading the Biography, among other 
courses. 

Because of the rich contributions of our various cultures, cultural events are a unique experience in our school. Every 
year we hold the International Food Festival, a Multicultural Festival, the Lunar New Year Festival, as well as dance, 
music, and media festivals throughout the school year. 

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

There are currently 5 students with IEPs. All of them need SETSS in Mathematics and English as a New Language. All 
special education students in the school are provided with instructional and emotional support as per the 
recommendations in their Individualized Educational Plan.

The table above shows Advance information in the element of Rigorous Instruction from the Framework for Great 
Schools, we review the data for Domain 3 (Instruction) of the Danielson Teacher Framework. 

 

In Component 3B (Using Questions and Discussion Techniques) developing ratings decreased from 5% to 4% and the 
combined ratings of effective and highly effective was 96%. 

 

In Component 3C (Engaging Student in Learning) the developing ratings stayed flat from 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 at 
5% while the highly effective ratings decreased from 41% in 2016-2017 to 30% in 2017-2018. Also in this component 
the effective rating increased from 55% in 2016-2017 to 65% in 2017-2018. 

 

In Component 3D (Using Assessment in Instruction) the highly effective ratings decreased from 38% in 2016-2017 to 
31% in 2017-2018. The change in effective ratings was 58% in 2016-2017 and it increased to 65% in 2017-2018. The 
developing ratings increased from 2% in 2016-2017 to 4% in 2017-2018. The school continues providing professional 
learning opportunities for the teachers and Assistant Principals to build capacity and increase knowledge in 
instructional practices. 

 

For school year 2018-2019, we will concentrate in building capacity and instructional practices in the classroom using 
Danielson and focusing in Domain 3. The indicators 3b: Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques; 3c: Engaging

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
l. A comprehensive assessment of our academic program was completed using the information from the High School 
Quality Snapshot from 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018. Also, Advance data from 2017-2018. 

The school has been able to maintain a high College Readiness Index of 43% compared with partner schools and 
citywide percentages. 71% of graduate students have enrolled in College within 18 months of graduation. 

The school is an ENL school that provides high quality education and challenging courses for immigrant students that 
are looking for a competitive education in the United States. 

The school has maintained an average of 89% of Attendance Rate compared with average city schools. Despite the 
current immigration challenges affecting many areas of migration influx, the school is allocating internal resources to 
follow up on attendance patterns and ensuring that students feel safe in the building. 

Although, graduation rate decreased during school year 2017-2018 (69% sy 2017-18), school has managed to provide 
ELL students with a competitive pathway for graduation which includes: Regents and Advanced Regents Diplomas. 
Also we offer six College Now Classes (Astronomy, Topics in Biology, Statistics, Speech Communication, Reading 
Biographies and Literature and Propaganda. In addition, to the opportunities for Advanced Placement Classes. 
Newcomers is a school of recent immigrants that offers the opportunity for students to take high level courses such 
as: AP Calculus, AP US Government, AP Spanish Language, AP Spanish Literature and AP Chinese Language and two 
courses newly added: AP English Language and AP Chemistry. 

 

 

2. The school needs to concentrate in the new data for school year 2017-2018 in which the graduation rate dropped 
to 69%.  

The four year graduation rate in 2017 was 77%, but in 2018 decreased to 69%. The new leadership of the school has 
conducted a data dive professional development to bring awareness to stakeholders and to identify trends for 
decrease. We have identified those as passing of English Regents exams and Credit Accumulation.  

Teachers will adjust curriculum based on student data and create revisions (New Addendum) to the school Curriculum 
Maps to adjust instruction based on data analysis. The goal is to provide rigorous instruction that challenges students 
with curricula that aligns practice and content to Common Core strategies. Newcomers High School will continue to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

strengthen teacher collaboration and Teacher teams in order to increase progress toward graduation, the graduation 
rate, and College Readiness.  

School Leaders will work collaboratively in infusing new instructional focus of: English Development Across 
Curriculum. This year the focus will be in writing. Teachers will use Language and Content Objectives to support the 
instructional focus of the school. We have aligned our inquiry work to a direct student-centered approached by 
shifting practices and embedding student work analysis to the inquiry cycle. Teachers will have the opportunity to 
assess students, develop an area of focus that is meaningful to their practice, explore new skills, peer-feedback on 
teaching practices and formative assessment in a cyclical instructional event supervised by school leaders. Teacher 
teams will have the opportunity to use protocols to get and to provide feedback of practices, implementation of skills 
and student work. They also, will have the opportunity to receive feedback from a supervisor attached to their inquiry 
circle. This practice will also expand embedded leadership at all levels. Teachers will facilitate the team meetings using 
researched protocols, but also all the administrators in the building (Content Supervisors and Administrators) will 
have the opportunity to interact directly and indirectly with instruction throughout the development of the inquiry 
cycle.  

The Professional Learning Plan of the school will follow cycles of lessons, implementations, feedback, assessment, and 
best practices and will not follow traditional execution of plans. The Professional Development committee has agreed 
that interaction with professional learning skills, time for implementation, and sharing of best practices will provide 
teachers with ownership and meaningful professional learning. The adoption of this new cycle of PLO Plan is part of 
the Plan presented by the Field Support Center. AP of English attended PD and turned key to the Professional 
Development Committee of the school. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By August 2019, Newcomers High School will increase the 2017-2018 graduation rate by 5% resulting in a 73% total, 
measured by the 2018 School Performance Dashboard.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Instruction:  

Data analysis to execute revisions in curriculum will be mandated 
for all the teachers in the school. Teachers will analyze detailed 
academic student profiles provided by the administration (from 
ATS and STARS reports) and identify common trends and areas of 
adjustments in their curriculum. 

 

 

Selected staff will attend and turn-key professional learning 
opportunities provided by our Field Support Center. Some 
examples are: Enhancing Student Engagement, Using Higher 
Order Questioning, Teaching Advanced Literacy Skills to ELLs, 
curriculum implementation, Planning and Preparation, and new 
requirements for Global History Exam, and Science 2020 roll out 
of new Regents examination. One teacher has also been selected 
to be trained in the Writing Revolution methodology.  

 

 

Teachers will use a new cycle of inquiry to examine student work 
and design strategic practices that will allow us to close the 
academic gaps in their individual classes: 

 

The inquiry cycle will include the focus of the school: 
Development of English Language Across Curriculum, and 
specifically this year's area of analysis and development will be 
writing.

Teachers will have the opportunity to select the inquiry areas of 
focus and to develop their own assessments, skills-based 
formative assessments, and instructional strategies. 

Some of the areas will include: use and application of Tier 3 
content vocabulary, sentence writing, paragraph writing, essay 
writing, annotation, using of conjunctions, argument writing, 
organization of claims and counter claims and supporting 
evidence.  

 

School Leaders will be providing professional learning 
opportunities and will model the use and application of effective 
Content Objectives and Language Objectives. 

 

The language objective initiative will be used in all contents areas 
and will emphasize the academic vocabulary acquisition process. 
The use of high-leverage language in all the functions for 
expressive language tasks will provide students with the 
necessary skills to develop comprehension and analysis of 
complex texts. 

 

Teachers will participate in learning walk-throughs: 

• Observation tools aligned with the Danielson Framework will 
be used to observe impact of language objective and learning 
objective, and focus of writing. 

• Administrators will facilitate debriefs to identify next steps 
based on patterns observed, and share those findings in 
department or faculty conferences.

Part 5 – Progress Monitoring  

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By February of 2019 we will review the credit accumulation for Fall Semester 2018-2019, scholarship reports and 
January 2019 Regent's results to analyze the status of the graduating cohort and areas of focus for the Spring 2019. 

 

This goal is in progress and will be measured by June and August 2019 results due to graduation requirements 
expectations such as: credit accumulation and Regents results in June. 

The school has identified students that need specific credits or Regents for graduation. Each Assistant Principal of the 
departments is working in collaboration with their teachers to design and implement action plans geared towards 
graduation. 

The inquiry cycle has been modified. The teachers have students in common and the focus of the inquiry is to develop 
writing skills across all disciplines.] 

The school has provided professional learning opportunities on-site and in the Field Support Center and District Office 
in order to enhance instructional practices that will result in promoting academic success for all our students. 

 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
School scholarship reports, credit accumulation tracker, Regent's results. 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In the School Quality Review Report from May 2015 the lead reviewer found: Teacher teams as an area of celebration. 
The groups had structures in place to support teacher growth.  

Findings 

Every teacher is engaged in several collaborative structures consistently relying on an inquiry approach to their work 
strengthening teacher instructional capacity while promoting the implementation of the Common Core Learning 
Standards including the instructional shifts that has resulted in school-wide instructional coherence and increased 
student achievement. Teachers meet regularly in structured teacher team collaborations and analyze key aspects of 
their practice, assessment data, and student work for students they have in common. 

Impact 

The teacher teaming structures allow for teachers to feel empowered in their practice and make decisions about 
teaching and learning that positively affect student outcomes. 

 

In the School Quality Snapshot from 2015-2016 85% of teachers responded positively to questions about 
Collaborative Teachers.  

 

Teachers engage in professional learning opportunities on weekly basis through their participating in Teacher Teams 
and Common Planning Time to collaborate in creating lesson/unit plans aligned with CCLS. The focus of their 
collaboration is to reflect on instructional practices and review strategies aligned to school-wide goals, common core 
alignment and implementation with a focus on language acquisition for our ELLs and SWDs. All staff members are 
engaged in the continuous cycle of inquiry and common planning to develop common assessments and lesson plans. 
An area of need is to plan formative assessment activities that provide greater opportunities for peer and self-
assessment in the classroom where students take a more active role in sharing feedback and self-assessment.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In the recent School Quality Snapshot shows that 86% of teachers responded positively to questions about effective 
school leadership. In the 2017 School Survey, 80 of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that the principal/school 
leader sets clear expectations for teachers about implementing what they have learned in professional development. 

Behavioral/Socio-Emotional Awareness: During school year 2017-2018 the school had an increase of 15 Level 4 and 
Level 5 incidents that resulted in Superintendent Suspensions as evidenced by the data obtained in the Occurence On-
Line Report System (OORS) that shows that last year the school had an increase of 15 Level 4 and 5 superintendent 
suspensions.  

The school is putting into effect a plan to expand supervisory resources in different areas of the building that includes: 

 
 

a ten minute rule for the use of the bathroom 
a hallways and bathroom patrol/supervision schedule  

Guidance Counselors will be attending lunch periods in the cafeteria to interact with students in a different school 
setting. 

Parents will receive workshops in how to deal with behavioral issues with their children. 

Teachers will enhance their instructional practices by having a strategic professional plan that not only will include 
instructional practices and strategies, but resources to identify warning signs in students with behavioral issues or in 
distressed. The uncertainty of the political arena has created stressful chain of reactions in immigrant families causing 
a direct impact in suspensions and behavioral issues.  

Reassignment of roles: As an area of immediate priority, the new Principal has designed a plan to assess, 
reassignment, and define key roles in the school community. The expectations and goals with different stakeholders 
from the school community have been redefined. The expectations of collaborative work, trust, and team ability for 
problem solving is expected at all levels of the school community including: interactions with campus school, 
administrators, teachers, supportive staff, students, and parents. 

High Expectations: The new Principal held town halls with all the students to address expectations and goals for the 
current year. Staff and parents have also been informed of the expectations. 

Professional Growth: To support professional growth, the Professional Development Plan for this year will be strategic 
in identifying exactly what the school needs based on the Instructional Focus and the potential areas of focus based 
on the suggested Planning for Professional Learning workshop offered by the North Field Borough Support. The school 
will utilize the same format to identify how to increase and embed the Instructional Focus: English Language

Development Across All Content Areas. Teachers will receive professional development in the implementation of 
Content and Language Objectives. They will be provided with opportunities to have an interactive professional 
learning opportunity by discussing problems in the construction and the development of the content objective. 
Teachers will have the opportunity to express their practices and how the language objective will support their 
content. In addition, professional learning opportunities will include: How to Scaffold Activities, How to do Meaningful 
Formative Assessments, How to Lead Classes to Good Questioning and Discussion Techniques. The Professional 
Learning Plan of the school will provide teachers with time to share best practices and feedback on implementation. 
In 2018-2019 we would like to embed leadership by having more teachers leading professional development. The 
school will also provide PLO in socio-emotional areas and how to identify signs of stress in students. The school plan 
will provide not only a comprehensive instructional approach but also socio-emotional skills to address the needs of 
the immigrant population.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The school environment is welcoming and inviting. There is active parental engagement in Parents Association 
meetings, parents' workshops, ELL parent meetings, and Parent Teacher Conferences. This is reflected in the high 
attendance that we experience during the PA Meetings where we average 150 parents per monthly meeting.  

In the 2018 NYC School Survey on Parent Involvement, parents responded positively when asked if they had 
opportunities to volunteer time to support the school. The survey shows the following data: 

  43% of parents/guardians agreed or strongly agreed that they have been asked to have opportunities to 

volunteer time to support the school. 

  74% of parents/guardians responded that they get opportunities to visit classrooms and observe instruction 

or participate in activities with their child.. 

In 2018-2019 we would like to increase the number of opportunities provided to parents to volunteer time in order to 
support the school and to increase the number of opportunities for families to visit classroom and observe instruction 
and/or participate in more activities with their children. This will be accomplished by creating a list of parent 
volunteers who will be contacted to participate in all of the events taking place at our school such as the International 
Food Festival, the Multicultural Show, trips organized by the school where there's constant demand for chaperon. We 
will also conduct School-Wide walk-throughs to visit classrooms and observe instruction, to visit school offices where 
various students' services are rendered to highlight strengths and make recommendations in areas for improvement.  

As an area of priority, Community Engagement will increase measured by the number of parents actively attending 
school events. 

The school must provide parents with at least, one Curriculum Night Event in which parents have the opportunity to 
discuss course sequence, requirements, syllabus, texts, and other resources provided to their children. 

Given the unique needs and challenges of our students and their parents as members of immigrant communities, we 
are conducting surveys, administered by the Parent Coordinator, in Parents Association meetings as well as, in 
parents meetings with counselors to provide parents with opportunities to volunteer time to support the school and 
to participate in activities with their child during the various events offered and organized by the school.. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.

By June 2019, we will increase the responses, from 43% to 50%, as measured by the 2018-2019 Parent survey that 
strongly agrees with the statement: "The school provides opportunities to volunteer time to support the school".

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
We work with colleges and universities to recommend highly qualified candidates for student teaching as well as to 
interview for vacancies. We also recruit through the DOE New Teacher Finder website to identified teachers who 
posses qualifications to serve our diverse student population of ELLs. The following are activities we practice to 
recruit, retain and support highly qualified teachers. 

● Administrative staff regularly attends hiring fairs to identify and recruit highly-qualified bilingual certified teachers. 

● The New Teacher Finder website is used to post vacancies and attract highly qualified teachers. 

● Rigorous interviews, evaluation of teacher portfolios, and demo lessons are used to hire the most qualified 
teachers. 

● Mentors are assigned to support new teachers as well as struggling teachers who require additional support. 

● We offer professional development for new teacher on creating a supportive environment as well as on planning 
and implementation of instruction, including development of curriculum maps and class contracts. 

● Through our Professional Development Committee we survey all teachers on areas of need in the classroom and 
then plan workshops, which are often facilitated by our own teachers.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Our professional learning plan for 2018-2018 will continue to focus on the integration of CCLS instructional shifts with 
an emphasis on the development of academic and domain specific vocabulary across all disciplines. Teachers accross 
all the content areas are expected to include a content objective, as well as a language objective. The language 
objective must be conducive to assist the demands of language development and language acquisition throughout the 
four skills of language.

In reading, the analysis of information with the focus of comprehension through diverse techniques such as: chunking 
the text, annotating, citing evidence and many other resources to increase reading skills. 

In writing, teachers will expose students to the process of writing leading them into steps of: writing sentences, 
developing paragraphs, essay writing, journals, responses to text, etc. Students will be actively involved in self-
assessments to identify revisions, organization of texts, editing and final product review.  

In speaking, teachers will create student-centered lessons in which students will be practicing English speaking skills in 
an academic setting. Students will be grouped in heterogeneous groups represented for the multiple races in the 
school community. Teachers and students will engage in conversations that include: accountable prompts to develop 
academic skills. Students will be able to differentiate different types of public speaking including: informative, 
persuasive, and other areas of speech . 

In listening, students will be able to show active listening skills that include understanding of academic vocabulary, 
verbal affirmations, reflections and understanding by providing verbal and written responses in the English Language.  

We will also offer the New York City Writing Project to teachers in the Spring semester, and with the support of the 
Queens North Borough Field Support Center we will offer PD in alignment with the Citywide Instructional 
Expectations, CCLS and the Capacity Framework

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Every teacher in the school belongs to an Inquiry Teacher Team. The teams develop diagnostics and final assessments 
to measure students’ skills development in alignment with CCLS. All Inquiry Teams meet regularly once a week to 
collaborate in the design of assessments and to plan strategies and practices to support students in making progress 
on a particular academic skill aligned with CCLS. This year we are focusing on development of academic writing across 
all the content areas. The inquiry teams have been rearranged and focus of writing has been analyzed and specifically 
aligned to the individual needs of the teachers in the inquiry teams. Teachers will have the opportunity to reflect in 
past inquiry cycles, adjust best practices and changed the outcome of the inquiry. Teachers will be assessing student 
work by using student samples of work, embedding teaching practices that will be analyzed and provided with 
feedback by peer teachers, and effectiveness of the cycle will be measured by a formative assessment based on the 
skills addressed by each inquiry team. Administrative support has been assigned to visit the teams and provide them 
with feedback and facilitation of conversations based on the status of each group. Inquiry Teacher Teams are led by 
teacher facilitators who meet as a Core Inquiry Team and engage in professional development to support teams in 
looking at student work, and integrating the school's instructional focus, English language development across all 
subjects, into curriculum units and classroom activities. This year the instruction focus will be shifted to include 
developing of writing in all subjects.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

 

 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Newcomers High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A 
of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

The final version of this document will be distributed to the school community in Parents Association meetings, and 
Student Government meetings throughout the 2018-2019 school year, and will be available on file in the Parent 
Coordinator’s office.  

A copy of the final version of this policy will also be submitted to the Office of School Improvement as an attachment 
to the school’s CEP and filed with the Office for Family Engagement and Advocacy. 

 

 

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

  The school will provide assistance to parents of children served by the school, as appropriate, by taking action 

as described in this paragraph “the State’s academic content standards; the State’s student academic 
achievement standards; the State’s and local academic assessments including alternate assessments; the 
requirements of Title I, Part A: how to monitor their child’s progress and how to work with educators.”

Newcomers High School builds the parents’ capacity for strong parental involvement, in order to ensure effective 
involvement of parents and to support a partnership among the school involved, parents, and the community to 
improve student academic achievement, through the following activities specifically described below:  

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

● The school will, with the assistance of the district and parents, educate its teachers, pupil services personnel, 
principals and other staff, in how to reach out to, communicate with and work with parents as equal partners, in the 
value and utility of contributions of parents, and in how to implement and coordinate parent programs and build ties 
between parents and the schools by:  

o Providing teachers with information regarding the most effective techniques in involving parents through respectful 
conversations.  

o Teachers’ DOE email addresses will be provided for parents so to increase communication between parents and 
teachers.  

o Teachers websites will be added to the school website for parents to review instructional support provided to 
students.  

o Parents are given the telephone number of the Parent Coordinator so that parents can make appointments to talk 
to other school personnel, teachers and Guidance Counselors.  

o The structures in place to ensure that parents understand program choices include having a full-time Parent 
Coordinator who is responsible for running the Parent Orientation Program and parent meetings at the school. The 
Parent Coordinator telephones parents to keep them abreast of important news, the rights, programs, and progress 
of their children.  

Some parents also are part of the School Leadership and other planning groups in order to keep the parent 
perspective in the planning of school policies and events.  

  

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

Newcomers High School takes the following actions to conduct, with the involvement of parent, an annual evaluation 
of the content and effectiveness of this parental involvement policy in improving the quality of its Title I, Part A 
program. The evaluation includes identifying barriers to greater participation by parents in parental involvement 
activities (with particular attention to parents who are economically disadvantaged, are disabled, have limited English 
proficiency, have limited literacy, or are of any racial or ethnic minority background).  

The Parent Coordinator, along with members of the PA Executive board organizes the parent feedback and presents 
the findings to the principal for review and consideration. Parents will have the opportunity to provide feedback on 
topics such as: instruction, school-to-home communication, guidance services, academic intervention services and

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

(1 class of ENL/Bilingual and 1 content area). 
The types of material used in each program: teacher-created worksheets connected to articles 
culled from various media sources such as NYTimes, newsela etc... laptops with programs such 
as Tenmarks for math, supplemental online textbooks, hands-on materials such as rocks and 
mineral samples in the science courses, and former regents exams, supplemental social studies

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
Please indicate how the PD  will positively impact the progress of ELLs: PD allows teachers to 
share best practices, and calibrate expectations and instructional approaches for the students 
registered. The goals are to increase student engagement and support through improved 
instruction. For example, content area teachers are trained in the use of ELL strategies, and are 
given time to collaborate with ENL teachers to share best practices.  
Please indicate if this component is at cost or at no cost to program: at cost - per session rates are 
given to all participants. 
Please indicate how records will be maintained including agendas and attendance sheets: 
Agendas and attendance sheets are submitted to the Principal's secretary for filing at the end of 
each session. Staff attending off-campus PDs submit a copy of their agendas to the Payroll 
Secretary.  
Please indicate name and qualifications of PD provider(s) (model teacher): Diane Giorgi, a 
retired DOE teacher who was trained in the New York City Writing Project and serves as the 
mentor to new teachers in our school. A licensed supervisor can also run the PD. Elizabeth 
Acerra, AP ENL, has run the PD, and is licensed in ENL and ELA, and was trained in the 
Writing Revolution protocols.  
Professional development is on-going. It takes place during the regular faculty and department 
meetings, after school, and on designated Staff Development Days. Subject level committees 
meet during Extended Time on Mondays.Teachers conduct workshops to share effective learning 
strategies and to examine student work to improve teacher practices. They also engage in "turn-
key" training, sharing best practices and techniques they have developed competency through 
attending off-site conferences and workshops.The Professional Development Plan for the 2018-
2019 school year includes developing curriculum units integrating the Common Core State 
Standards. We will also continue to incorporate use of technology as a tool for instruction to 
enhance teaching and learning. Other workshops we plan to offer this year include the following 
topics: Formative Assessment Tools for ELLs, Literacy across Content Areas, Interdisciplinary 
Connections to Develop Instructional Objectives, Language Development in the Bilingual 
Classroom.Teachers in the After School Academic Intervention program are invited to

Please indicate how parents of Title III students as well as parents of ELLs will participate in 
these activities: they are invited to the school to attend the workshops and English classes.  
Please indicate how records will be maintained including agendas, attendance sheets and 
invitations in parents’ preferred languages: the Parent Coordinator facilitates extensive outreach, 
including PhoneMaster in translation, and sending notices home. Records are submitted to the 
principal's secretary for filing.  
Please indicate rationale for parent workshop based on needs analysis: parents have reached out 
requesting English each year at Orientation or SLT/Parent Association meeting. The Parent 
Coordinator identified a list of frequently asked questions by parents to determine specific 
trainings needed. Suggestion Boxes were also culled for workshop suggestions at Cabinet 
Meetings. 
Please indicate how the translation needs of parents will be met (translation services at the 
events): The school utilizes bilingual teachers as interpreters, as well as Transmitter/Receiver 
Interpretation equipment purchased by the school.  
 
There are workshops scheduled for parents through Queens Community House on Saturdays in 
the library from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm. For the Fall Semesters, the workshops are provided from 
November to January. For the Spring Semester, the workshops are provided from March to 
June.  The Parent Coordinator, Elise Victoria, notifies parents in the language of their preference 
of the workshops during PA meetings and by using the school phone messenger on weekly 
basis.  Informational packets are distributed to parents during the parent-teacher conferences, 
SLT meetings, parent association meetings, and parent orientations.  To support parents' 
continued engagement in children's learning, parents are being invited to Meet Your Teacher 
Week" during lunch periods to discuss curricula and class expectations. In addition, the school 
will continue to work with Community-Based Organisations to support parents with immigrant-
specific social services/issues.   The workshops will be offered through partnerships between our 
school and Community-Based- Organizations such as Jacob Riis, Catholic Charities, Salvation 
Army, and at no cost. LaGuardia Community College with school counselors will also facilitate 
workshops on college and career readiness as well as youth development.

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Standalone ENL classes are structured by ENL levels.  Given that one of the instructional goals of the school is 
language development across content areas and that nearly all students at Newcomers High School are ELLs and 
former ELLS, all entering, emerging, and some transitioning and expanding students receive one unit of Standalone 
ENL in addition to their integrated ENL classes with ELA content.  Students are grouped homogeneously according to 
their English proficiency level in alignment with NYSESLAT/NYSITELL and teacher-created ELL Periodic Assessments.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Entering and emerging students in TBE programs receive a minimum of 2 bilingual content classes and 1 HLA class in 
addition to their mandated ENL classes. Transitioning and Expanding students receive a minimum of 1 bilingual 
content class and 1 HLA class in addition to mandated ENL classes.Currently, Newcomers High School offer Spanish 
and Chinese bilingual classes in Math, Science, and History.Chinese and Spanish HLA classes are offered to students in 
TBE program.  Content courses are by grade level, except math, which is ungraded and based on proficiency level 
according to in-house assessment.HLA classes are by grade level.The bilingual content classes are by grade levels. 
  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Currently, Newcomers High School does not offer Dual Language programs. 
  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 The programming office, in conjunction with the guidance department, consult the parent selection survey, NYSESLAT and 
NYSITELL data on ATS to inform the programming each semester. At Newcomers High School, students who are Entering and 
Emerging, levels receive 3 classes (594 minutes) of ENL instruction per week.  Each ENL/ELA class is 198 minutes per week in 
total. Expanding level students receive 1 or 2 classes of Integrated ENL in ELA, decided by the administration on a case by case 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

basis after reviewing credit accumulation and regents exam data.Commanding level students and Former ELLs receive a 
minimum of 1 class of integrated ENL in ELA.Students in TBE program receive 1 class of HLA according to preference listed on 
parent survey.    
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Bilingual classes are offered in Math, Science and History.  Core content areas are delivered in several ways in both the TBE 
program and the Free Standing ENL programs.  In both programs, teachers use the SIOP model to scaffold not only content 
objectives but also language objectives. ENL strategies that are used to deliver comprehensible input include sentences 
starters, sequencing, various vocabulary building strategies, word walls, activating prior knowledge and SQ3R, as well as native 
language support. At the beginning of each term, the school interdisciplinary inquiry teams select Common Core skills 
(i.e.,  citing evidence from text) and assess student work to guide teachers in designing tasks that target the skill across all 
grades and content areas.  Students in Free Standing ENL classes have access to bilingual resources including bilingual texts 
and glossaries.  In the Chinese and Spanish TBE program, the idea is that students will transfer academic, conceptual, and 
other skills acquired in their native language to academic and conceptual development in English as their second language. The 
amount of English used in a classroom depends on students' English proficiency. However, it increases gradually as student's 
English proficiency increases, following the NYS recommended ratios of 75% HL to 25% English for Entering levels, 60% HL to 
40% English for Emerging levels; 50-50% for Transitioning level; and 25% HL to 75%  English language use for Expanding level 
learners. Teachers differentiate their instruction according to these varied levels. 
   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

To evaluate ELLs in their native language the school has several diagnostic/benchmark exams in place such as the Chinese 
Reading Test levels 3-5, Spanish ELE test Level E, and the Lab-R in Spanish. Throughout the year, the school relies on teacher-
created formative and summative assessments given in class throughout the semester. The HLA teachers evaluate students, 
who are in TBE program, in their native languages throughout the year using assessment tools developed in house.  We also 
facilitate the administration of LOTE Exam for students who speak languages other than English. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

All students are programmed according to their NYSESLAT level and in-house assessments - students are grouped according to 
these levels, not by grade, in English/ENL courses and TBE content area classes. For ENL students in content areas, 
programming is done based on assessment performance, and teachers differentiate instruction for students based on 
NYSESLAT level.  
5a. For SIFE students Newcomers provides literacy classes which provides additional support in a small class setting. Students 
are scheduled with flexibility in that they receive two intensive classes, one of which is a double period (132 minutes). Also, in 
Math we provide an extra class for beginning algebra students who need the extra skills to complete the Algebra course 
work.  Flexible programming is used to program students with IEP to provide instruction in least restrictive environment. 
Students are provided an additional seminar course once a week as well which focuses on literacy instruction.5b. All of our 
students are newcomers. Therefore, we provide them with more than the state mandated minutes, as well as separate 
courses focusing on intensive Common Core standards in literature and informational text. We continue to use a textbook, the 
Edge series from National Geographic, uniformly across levels 1-2 (Entering and emerging students). We also provide New 
Student Workshop classes to help support them in adapting to what is in many cases a new and different educational system. 
We also thoroughly explain the graduation requirements and high school expectations upon entrance.5c.  For ELLs receiving 
services for four to six years, we offer academic intervention services through  tutoring after school, on Saturday, and during 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

the school day. We also program with flexible scheduling in mind. Some classes are offered before the regular school day and 
after the regular school day.  We also program identified students for Regents Preparation classes to help them graduate on 
time.5d. As only students with less than one year in the U. S. are admitted, Newcomers does not have any long-term ELLs 
completing 6 years of service.5e. Former ELLs are programmed for a minimum of one integrated ELA class.  Students have the 
option of English elective classes including Journalism, Media Studies, and Human Rights.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Our programming includes push-in instruction to various content classes for ELL-SWDs, as well as a once a week seminar 
course for additional support, both taught by the licensed Special Education teacher. A plethora of strategies and techniques 
are utilized to make language and content comprehensible to English Language Learners, and our ELL-SWDs. These strategies 
include using differentiated and integrated instructional techniques. Teachers have content as well as linguistic objectives for 
each class, using scaffolding concepts  (graphic organizers, writing templates, pre-learning, during-learning, and post-learning 
activities, small group and pair work), activating prior knowledge, linking new learning to past, reinforcing key terms and 
vocabulary (word walls, note-taking techniques, keeping journals), highlighting functional language in context, adapting 
materials to make them more comprehensible, promoting critical thinking skills, providing summaries of lessons, using 
outlines, bringing realia to class, using technology in the classroom (the Internet, SmartBoards, overhead projectors, Google 
Classroom), using collaborative and cooperative learning activities (including various forms of group work). All of these 
strategies provide students with opportunities to use the language for meaningful exchange and negotiation of meaning. Using 
hands-on activities, technology and visual as well as aural materials, encouraging student participation and in-class 
presentations, designing projects (project-based and thematic activities), doing constructivist reading and writing activities 
(using reading strategies, e.g., prediction, questioning the text, making connections, visualizing predicting, summarizing), and 
other meaningful, relevant student-centered tasks fosters engagement in our classrooms. 
 
Grade-level materials used include varioues works of literature, the Edge textbook series, Scholastic magazine, newsela 
articles, New York Times articles, as well as primary source documents from other content areas. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We offer a program grid that schedules students for up to 9 courses a week. We offer morning classes that begin at 7:30 am 
and lab classes taught after the regular school day. Our grid schedule allows us to provide a seminar one period a week where 
specific needs of students are addressed, whether it be the College Preparation and Application Process, make-up Science labs, 
and Regents Preparation among others. Our students with IEPs are provided specialized curriculum in the seminar courses, as 
well as tailored tutoring classes once a week. Our Special Education teacher provides push-in SETTS as per IEP to ENL and Math 
classrooms as well.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 Newcomers identifies students who are at risk thoughout the year using data collected from student grade reports, and in-
house assessment tools that are modeled after the NYSESLAT and Regents. Newcomers schedules at-risk or off-track students 
for after-school and Saturday AIS classes. In ELA, we offer support and Regents prep to Levels 1-5 in English. In Math, we offer 
Algebra Common Core, Trigonometry and Geometry.  In Science, we have Living Environment and Earth Science.  In Social 
Studies, we have Global History and US History classes. Depending on enrollment and the demographics of the students in 
need, classes are offered in Spanish and in Chinese Mandarin. Also, many of the content courses are taught by bilingual 
teachers. In addition, as mentioned earlier, one period a week (called seminar) is dedicated to aligning the class with specific 
student’s needs. During that period, we offer over 30 intervention courses, including Algebra, Global History and US History 
and Government, and also Science makeup labs. Again, depending on the demographics, these classes are offered in Spanish 
and Chinese as well as English.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

 New programs considered this year and next are the LEAD program and Repertorio Espanol, which are theater and dramatic 
performance-based programs offered to our beginner ELLs in conjunction with their Integrated ENL/ELA course as well as in 
Saturday school. This program pairs an ENL teacher with a theater teaching artist to improve literary analysis skills as well as 
listening and speaking. Our AP of Guidance has brought several new programs for our students on board. We are beginning 
intensive SAT prep courses with training provided to our teachers by A-List, to improve student outcomes on SAT. In preparing 
students for college and career readiness, we are entering into partnership with Global Kids to help develop new leaders 
among our ELLs, SAYA, which promotes college and career readiness for Southeast Asian students, and Go Campusing, which 
provides curated trips for students to various college campuses. In addition, we are partnering with L.O.V.E. which provides 
services inbn Latina mentoring. In professional development, we are engaging Custom Computers to bring in a consultant on 
using technology in the classroom in response to teacher feedback that this PD was needed. 
In curriculum, teachers have designed new ENL/ELA courses to support our ELLs in college and career readiness as well as 
social-emotional growth. One course, called Mindfulness, includes in-depth study of the neuroscience behind mindfulness 
practices such as meditation, and instructs students on how to better support their social-emotional growth and deal with 
stress. Another, College Writing, provides project-based learning opportunities for upper level and former ELLs to prepare for 
the demands of college writing, including research papers and speech writing. 
We will continue our work with the Junior Achievement program in our social studies to focus on personal finance education 
for our economics students. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 
There is no program/service for ELLs that has been discontinued.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Since 100% of our student population are ELL’s or former ELL’s, they are afforded access to all school programs. Our Student 
Government, Athletic teams,  and CBO programs are comprised solely of ELLs and some former ELLs. There are many 
supplemental services for our ELL’s.  Newcomers offers students after school and Saturday classes, as previously mentioned. 
We also have a partnership with LaGuardia Community College. 
In the College Now and Bridge Program offers, students take classes in Intro to Travel Industry, Literacy and Propaganda, 
Topics in Biology, Astronomy, Reading the Biography, Communications, College Algebra, Sociology, and Trigonometry. 
   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
In the content area, teachers use textbooks in English and bilingual textbooks and workbooks. They also use bilingual 
glossaries, word-walls, graphic organizers, and visuals to make the content accessible and enhance English language 
learning.  We also have a partnership with LaGuardia Community College. Additionally, in the interest of creating more 
cohesion for our Newcomers in levels 1-2, we have adopted a new curriculum for informational text and literature study based 
on the National Geographic textbook series Edge. We have also purchased the series Newcomers USA to support SIFE students 
in our literacy program. In the HLA program, an abundance of native language literature is provided. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

When students first register, as part of the ELL Identification process, starting next year we will administer In-House literacy 
assessments in the home language, including Spanish and Chinese, Russian, Arabic, and Bengali to identify students with low 
literacy in their native language, as well as possible SIFE. 
In the TBE program, as the ENL, students are afforded native language support. In the TBE program, depending on the 
students’ English proficiency level and the class, students receive input and give output in their native language. As their 
English proficiency level increases, the amount of native language support diminishes, never reaching zero.  In the ENL 
program, students use bilingual dictionaries and are often allowed to express what they know if different way, i.e. visuals, 
utterances, words. Again, as their proficiency level increases, so does their use of more sophisticated English. 
In the content areas, teachers use textbooks in English and bilingual textbooks and workbooks. They also use bilingual

as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Instructional Focus 2016-2017: 
•             English Language Development Across all Subjects. 
•             Language Objectives for every lesson in reading, writing, listening and speaking through collaborative 
discussion.  Identifying specific skills that student will develop in the lesson. 
 
•             Inquiry Teacher Teams will focus on Common Core Learning Standards. Reinforcing Skills across all subjects as follows: 
•             Academic Vocabulary (Language 6 Standard) in Arts, and Physical Education. 
•             Citing Evidence from Text (Reading Informational Text 1 Standard) in Science. 
•             Write Informative/Explanatory texts (Writing 2 Standard) in Social Studies, and Word Languages.

The Professional Development Committee is composed of four teachers designated by the UFT Chapter Leader, and four 
assistant principals designated by the principal. This PD Committee meets once a month to plan workshops for a series of 
mandated PD that takes place after-school on the third Monday of every month from October to May. The PD Committee also 
plans activities and workshops for Chancellor’s PD days. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

 

This PD Committee designated 6 goals for our school this year, along with action plans for each: 
1. To strengthen the capacity of teacher teams to align units of study with Common Core Standards. The focus will be 
summarizing to build on explanatory writing, citing evidence from information and academic vocabulary development. 
2. To improve teacher effectiveness focusing on using questioning and discussion techniques by developing a common 
understanding of strengthening students English language development through collaborative discussions in which students 
improve listening and speaking skills as well as critical thinking. 
3. To improve staff members expertise on the use of instructional technology. 
4. To provide teachers with professional development through classroom residencies by Theater organizations to enhance 
students’ speaking and listening skills as they develop proficiency in English as a New Language. 
5. To provide teachers with professional development through and After-School Critical Friends Program. 
6. To provide staff members with professional development on student support including: meeting students’ unique needs, 
responding to socio-emotional needs, differentiation. 
 
In addition to the instructional focus this year, PD is provided based on teacher feedback. For example, we offered support in 
using technology in classrooms with ELLs, such as Google Classroom. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The PD Committee determines the scheduled hours for our school's professional development activities, ensuring that these 
guidelines are met, and agendas and sign-sheets are kept in file as a part of school record for all professional development 
activities.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
ENL teachers scheduled two official meetings with parents this year, but next year we will select one day each month to 
discuss goals of the ELL programs, language development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language 
development needs in all content areas.  Newcomers  High School have multilingual staff who can provide translation and 
interpretation for parents and teachers.  When necessary, the Language Access Coordinator makes arrangements with the 
NYCDOE Translation and Interpretation Service to have interpreters available for these meetings.  Teachers will keep records 
(sign-in sheets for in person meetings, phone logs on Skedula for phone calls, and a copy of letters sent home as certified 
registered  mail with return receipt) of annual individual meetings with ELL parents. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

All of our students are ELLs and therefore the majority of parents and guardians are also ELLs or former ELLs. Our parents are 
very involved in the School Leadership Team, and participate very actively in Parent Association meetings. Parents also 
participate in school walk-throughs every semester organized by the SLT. Our school has a full time bilingual Parent 
Coordinator who assists parents during the registration process and throughout the school year as point contact person with 
the parents and as key member in the organization of parents meetings throughout the school year. The Parent Coordinator 
also disseminates information in various languages to parents, and communicates with them to  telephones parents to keep 
them to keep them abreast of important news, their rights, programs, and the progress of their children. School aides are also 
bilingual (Chinese and Spanish) and assist in helping parents when they come to register/enroll their children. When in-person 
interpreters are unavailable, staff utilize the Over-the-phone interpretation services provided by the DOE. Stickers with the 
necessary contact information are located on every phone in the building. Parent Association meetings are held monthly and 
are attended by teachers, aides or others who can translate. Some parents also are part of the School Leadership Team, the

Parents Association, and other planning groups in order to keep the parent perspective in the planning of school policies and 
events. Saturday school programs include English classes for parents and training on: computer skills, patient rights, 
immigration issues, graduation requirements and college application process, and others.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Orlando Sarmiento, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

• At registration parents complete a language survey to receive documents in their home language. 

• This data on parents preferred language is entered onto RLPA in ATS. 

• Reports generated from ATS help us determine the number and languages needed to be translated.  

• Admit forms are then sent to the Translation and Interpretation Unit by the parent coordinator for translation 
and returned within a two week period. 

• The number of bilingual courses and bilingual staff members are determined by the number of pupils and their 
language needs. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73 

 

• Parents choose a Transitional Bilingual Education or English as New Language program for their child. 

• Students are evaluated using the NYSITELL examination. Over 80% are found to be beginner level ELL’s. 

• On the home language survey over 99% of the parents indicate that they speak a language other than English. 

• Other useful documents are also translated. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language
