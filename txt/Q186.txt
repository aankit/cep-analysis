Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

P.S. 186 is dedicated to developing an environment in which students, parents and staff work collaboratively to 
maximize their intellectual, emotional and social potential. We will provide students with a rigorous curriculum that 
focuses on meeting or exceeding standards. It is our goal to develop in all of our students a love of learning and an 
ability to succeed as contributing citizens of society. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
PS 186, Castlewood school is located in Bellerose next to the Queens County Farm. It is the perfect blend of urban and 
suburban environments. We are near public transportation, retail stores, and restaurants, but we can also go outside 
at recess and see horses, pigs, and goats. PS 186 educates nearly 400 students of varying ethnic, racial, socio-
economic, and educational backgrounds. The Castlewood community is firm in its belief that all children can learn, 
and all of our students receive as many opportunities to learn in their own special and unique ways as possible. We 
believe that every student has special "needs." We also believe that every student has special "gifts." Over 80% of our 
classes are integrated co-teaching classes and have students with and without IEPs as well as a general and a special 
educator leading them on their quest towards independence and critical thinking. As a staff, we value diversity and 
difference. We strive to highlight the unique capacities of every child. Our students all have the chance to participate 
in visual arts, theater, music, technology, and physical education. They are involved in extracurricular activities such as 
Student Council, the Kindness Committee, and the Diversity Club. Moreover, 100% of our teachers are highly 
qualified, and many have specialized training (ex: ABA, TCIS, LSCI, TCRWP, Wilson, Fundation, LLI, SPIRE, G and T, ENL) 
in order for all students to have equal access to the curriculum through multiple entry points. Our classes are small, 
and we pride ourselves in being able to provide students with a safe and supportive atmosphere. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

PS 186 is home to zoned, community students as well as to students in the ASD Nest program and students from P224 
(a District 75 program for students with special needs). We have students in almost every class who are exceptional. 
Many have autism; some are English Language Learners; several have gifts and talents that surprise us. Our students 
require educators who are well-versed in special education programs and services as well as those who have strong 
content knowledge and pedagogical skills. Our students need support as they learn to become flexible, social, and 
compassionate individuals. They also need to be challenged with rigorous tasks that will push them to think critically 
about real life problems and solutions.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

We have determined that a focus area for this school year will be working to develop greater student independence 
and ownership of learning and responsibilities, especially as they reach the higher grades in order to better prepare 
them for middle school, based upon parent and alumni interviews. Therefore, our instructional focus this year will be: 
“Teachers will foster student independence by ensuring that there are multiple entry points through which they can 
access the information necessary to engage in inquiry, take part in high level discussions, and strategically solve 
problems in an environment that allows for diversity and exceptionality (including gifted and talented students, 
SWDs, and ELLs).”

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
The school measures students' stamina, collaboration, and discussion skills on a standardized progression. The data is 
collected four times a year. Over the course of the year each grade has shown significant growth in the percent of 
students demonstrating grade level skills in stamina, collaboration and discussion. However, there is limited evidence 
of the students' ability to transfer skills from one year to the next. One theory is that the data has been collected 
during a variety of different disciplines. With significant differences in the expectation of students in different subject 
areas (ex: STEM, ELA, Math), the data raised questions with regard to its reliability. Therefore, the data will be 
collected in math class with complex, real world math tasks being used as the data collection activity. There is a 
school-wide rubric that has been used reliably for over 5 years to assess students' math skills in activities that require 
collaboration and communication when solving complex math tasks. This foundation will provide clear expectations 
for the tasks given when collecting data in discussion and stamina. Additionally, we have looked at data from our 
2017-2018 Quality Review as well as our School Learning Survey. These documents indicate that there needs to be 
more consistent Professional Learning Opportunities provided as well as more time spent visiting one another's 
classrooms via collaborative rounds and learning walks. As indicated by our standardized test scores and Advance 
observation data, increased content PL in Math and ELA (particularly writing), needs to be woven into PL on a weekly 
basis. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, students will be able to engage in authentic discourse around a specific Math task as evidenced by 65% 
(an increase of 7% from June 2018) of students school-wide (K-5) meeting or exceeding grade-level proficiency as 
measured on the Student Independence Progression.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

 

In September 2018, all teachers (classroom and cluster) will 
receive the data collected on their students during the 2017-
2018 school year so that they will be able to analyze it in order to 
plan instruction that targets specific skills within each 
component of the Student Independence Progression that was 
created during the 2017-2018 school year. Teachers will have 
time in November to reflect on the data and use it to plan for 
future instruction. Their ideas, plans, and reflections will be 
revisited throughout the year as they work within their cohorts 
and grade level teams. Coaches will individualize plans for each 
teacher with whom they work. Coaching will consist of modeling, 
lesson planning, and conducting intervisitations both within and 
outside of the school. 

Teachers will receive professional learning opportunities during 
the September PL days as well as during the first three PL 
Monday sessions that deal specifically with increasing student 
independence in group work, discussion, and stamina (with 
targeted strategies based upon their cohort discipline).

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Parent workshops, given by the administration, the Parent Coordinator, selected teachers, and coaches, will be 
offered to parents so that they have an understanding of what student independence consists of in terms of the 
Student Independence progression as well as what is developmentally appropriate for students as they move through 
the grades. Parents will be given specific strategies and activities to support their learning. Parent workshop 
presentations will be adjusted to be an activity based format to allow parents to simulate the learning experience of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

their children and deepen their own mathematical understanding. We will have three specific cycles of workshops for 
parents. The first (in the fall) will be focused on Student Independence and Choice; the second (in the winter) will 
focus around rigor; and the last (in the spring) will focus on students strengths and the development of a strengths-
based curriculum.

Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
In the past year, 100% of the students participate in Respect for All. To date, the activities that the students 
participated in were led and created predominantly by teachers. Based on data gleaned from our Quality Review, 
School Survey, and informal conversations with multiple constituency groups, as a school, we feel that using the 
Kindness Committee and Student Council, we can have students work to create activities for the students to 
participate. In the past year assemblies have been student run, we have had a co-presidency with a student in PS 224. 
Our school has had a strong focus on pushing students towards being independent in the classroom and throughout 
the school day. In the past, we have not utilized student surveys for this particular purpose; however, surveys have 
been used to capture students' perceptions about the amount of choice they are given, how "rigorous" their tasks 
are, and in which subjects they receive feedback from their teachers. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, student leaders on the Kindness Committee and Student Council will create three RFA/SEL activities and 
survey the students in grades 3-5 to determine the effects that student led activities have on perspective-taking, 
empathy, appreciating diversity, and respect for others of the social awareness component of the SEL core 
competencies.

implementation and oversight. 
Parent engagement time can be used to have workshops on kindness, and activities the committee takes part in. 
Students can send home activities that can be completed with a parent. We can have parent volunteers to collect and 
organize materials collected from kindness events (book drive, clothing drive, food drive, etc.) These parents will be 
encouraged to take part in both in school and out of school activities that help drive the kindness and help to highlight 
how they act as role models for our students. Parents will also be asked to help by forming a committee of members 
who will meet to help carry out the students ideas within the school and the community. Workshops and activities are 
on-going throughout the year; however, planning for the activities takes place on a monthly basis.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

During the 2016-2017 and 2017-18 school year, we began working towards increasing student engagement and 
collaboration among teachers to share effective practices. This goal was to support teachers in modifying traditional 
published curricula to include more student centered and project/problem based learning units of study. Using 
instructional strategies identified as promoting independence (i.e. group work or student-led discourse) as per the 
school’s instructional focus across multiple instructional units in a specific content area, there have been 
improvements in the 3c component of the MOTP ratings. Comparing ratings from 2016-2017 school year to 2017-
2018 school year, there are no longer any “ineffective” teachers (previously 1.28%) and the percentage of 
“developing” teachers went down from 21.76% to 16.67%. Teachers with “effective” and “highly effective” ratings 
increased accordingly.  

In the same time frame, teacher learning has also significantly improved as indicated by 4e component of the MOTP 
ratings. In 2017-2018 school year, there are no teachers rated as “developing” (4.42% in 2016-2017). However, there 
has been little change in the percentage of teachers rated “highly effective”. The primary criteria for improvement is 
for effective strategies to be shared among teachers and replicated in other classrooms.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will work collaboratively and grow professionally (as evidenced by 10% of teachers 
increasing their MOTP ratings in 4e by at least 1 level) by working in cohorts led by instructional coaches. They will be 
able to use the skills learned during this type of professional learning opportunity across disciplines to increase rigorous 
instruction in the classroom (as evidenced by 10% of teachers increasing their MOTP ratings in 3c by at least 1 level).

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

After reviewing the data from the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 Learning Environment survey, we discovered that 
teachers would like more opportunities to have a significant voice in the decision-making process of the school with 
regard to areas such as hiring, curriculum, and grading. During the 2017-18 school year, teachers participated in self-
selected yearlong teacher led committees (TLCs) that concentrated on a large number of areas that were of potential 
interest. In the Spring, teachers were brought together to share their ideas concerning the decisions made in these 
areas. They reflected on their experiences working on their TLC and brainstormed ideas for both improving the 
systems and procedures around developing TLCs that are engaging and impactful so that teachers' voices can be 
heard throughout the year rather than only in the Spring. Their reflection surveys showed that teachers enjoyed 
working on the committees and felt that they were a way for teachers to work collaboratively to make improvements 
within the school community; however, they also stated that they would like the number of committees offered to be 
reduced so that their concentration, time, and energy could be spent developing and sharing expertise and interest in 
a specific TLC that would work throughout the year to develop meaningful activities, to produce useful documents, 
and to have ownership in the decisions pertaining to their TLCs.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, five of the nine teacher-led committees will show impact on teacher pedagogy and/or student self-
management as evidenced by an increase on teacher MOTP rating on 4e and/or teacher/parent responses to a self-
management survey (respectively).

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and 
strategies your school will implement to achieve the 
identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools 
element, including: 

Target Group(s) 
Who will be 
targeted? 

Timeline 
What is the 
start and 
end date? 

Key Personnel 
Who is responsible 
for implementing 
and overseeing the 
activity/strategy? 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, 

 

professional development, and/or systems and 
structures needed to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other 
high-need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

Choices of possible Teacher-led committees will be posted 
so that teachers and staff have the opportunity to self-select 
the committee on which they would like to work. These 
teams include an SEL committee that will work on the power 
of Mindfulness, a hiring committee that will decide upon the 
criteria for hiring exemplary staff, a "green team" that will 
work towards reducing our carbon footprints on the world, a 
strengths-based curriculum team that will research the 
advantages of utilizing this type of an instructional approach, 
and several others. TLCs are linked to cohorts, TLCs, and 
individual passions. 

 

Each committee will choose a committee leader who will be 
responsible for setting the agenda and submitting notes to 
the administration four times per year. 

 

Each committee will devise a vision, create a charter, and 
develop ideas (around their committee's focus) that will 
impact the school community. The constituency that will be 
most affected will be clearly stated within the plans and 
notes. 

Each committee will participate in two "Share Fairs" for staff 
and parents that highlight the impact of each TLC's work 
product, event, activity...on the school community.

Parents reported that although they enjoy workshops that focus on the development of their children as "whole" 
people as opposed to workshops that have a strict academic emphasis, they also have an interest in having a greater 
understanding of the Student Independence Progression and Rigor and how they can apply the same strategies in the 
home thereby deepening the home-school connection. However, attendance at workshops as a whole continued to 
stagnate during 2017-2018. Based on parent feedback and surveys it was determined that although early morning 
workshops are preferred over workshops during standard parent engagement hours, attendance oftentimes 
remained difficult for many. Therefore, we have designed a series of workshops to be presented in three cycles 
consisting of 3 workshops per cycle covering the requested topics to be presented in both morning and evening 
hours. These will be in addition to family workshops offering hands-on activities for all participants. Additionally, 
parents expressed a need to prepare siblings under age 3 for school readiness. We have designed a series of parent-
child workshops specific to this need. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, 25% of the parents who have participated in workshops that are geared toward increasing knowledge of 
Student Independence, Rigorous Instruction, and Social Emotional Learning will create and utilize "parallel" tasks, 
activities, and prompts in the home that support these school foci as evidenced by surveys that they complete.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS186, The Castlewood School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

PS 186: The Castlewood School will support parents and families of students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents. This 
information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Parent Involvement Policy, parent members of the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Parent 
Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and improve parent 
involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding funds, which are allocated directly to the school to promote 
parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team and the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association). This includes providing technical support and ongoing 
professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams and Parent Association (or Parent-
Teacher Association); 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
In grades K-5, we use the Teacher's College Reading and Writing assessments to find the reading levels of the students as well 
as insight into their concepts of print. The data gives us an idea of the literacy levels of our ELLs.  It shows us their knowledge 
of print, identification of individual letters and sounds, sight words, spelling capabilities and use of reading strategies.  The 
students’ reading level is assessed as well as their literal and inferential comprehension skills.  Insight is also gained into the 
ELLs’ speaking skills as they retell the stories read.  This gives the classroom and ENL teacher the information needed to guide 
instruction and create individual benchmarks. These benchmarks may not be “on grade level” but are adjusted to meet the 
needs of the students who are just acquiring the English language. Teachers make assessments across the grades to measure 
students' skill levels and next steps.   We assess the students’ reading levels on a bi-monthly basis. We also have noticed 
that some of our ELLs are also SWD, so their instruction must be scaffolded in ways that support both exceptionalities. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

The ENL teacher meets with the classroom teachers on a bi-monthly basis to share and discuss the data of the ELL 
students.  During these meetings, the teachers discuss the data and see how it will drive the instruction of our ELLs.  Also, the 
ENL teacher will share her data of the push in classes to see if the instruction of the small group is transferring into the larger 
group setting.  All of the instruction for both the ENL classes as well as the regular classroom will be guided from the formative 
assessments as well as teacher collected data. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
When evaluating the success of our ENL program, we look, not only at the NYSESLAT, ELA, Math, and Science scores, but also 
at our students' written work (including but not limited to task assignments), oral presentations, etc.) Additionally, we look at 
our students' social skills and interpersonal relationships to see if they are acclimating to the country and able to use the 
language to navigate the situations within the building. If we determine that limited progress is being made, we alter the 
materials used, modalities in which we teach, and/or the content of the lesson.  Thus far, our ENL program is very 
successful.  The success is evaluated by analyzing the data from all assessments, both formal and informal, and observations of 
our ELLs.  Our analysis shows that our ELLs usually reach proficiency within 2 to 3 years.  Also, our former ELLS have moved on 
and achieved the goals and standards set for all students.  We will continue to provide academic rigor each year ensuring 
academic success for our ELLs.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the data has been gathered, we have several options to help our ELL students in their area of need.  We have daily AIS 
periods in every class, before and after school remediation classes, an RTI program, and Fundations and Wilson classes.  Also, 
the ENL teacher uses portions of the Sandford Harmony program to develop the ELLs speaking skills. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
At PS 186, we use data to guide instruction and support the academic achievement of ELLs by looking at each child's academic 
history and patterns found in English language proficiency (based on standardized test scores and informal observations and 
assessments).  By analyzing this data, we are able to determine whether a student has an issue with processing information or 
is still becoming proficient in the English language.  For example, a student who scores expanding/commanding in speaking 
and listening but is still entering in reading and writing may have a processing problem or an issue that is not second language 
related.  The teachers use ongoing student assessments and tiered instruction for struggling students.  ENL services are 
considered a Tier 1 service. Tier 2 is extra exposure to instruction, focused on students' needs.  Tier 3 instruction is intensive 
intervention which consists of one-on-one tutoring or additional special services.  If these students do not make progress in 
Tier 3, they are referred for special education services.  We have found that the best practices in literacy assessment are using 
a variety of data sources to design tailored instruction, facilitate student learning, and monitor progress.  We use the data 
from these assessments to identify students for Tier 2 interventions.  The data from formative assessments is used to monitor 
progress and RTI instruction.  It can be used frequently, and is guided by instruction based on the curriculum.  This is largely 
driven by teacher observation, although assessments can be formal as well as informal.  An example of this would be Fountas 
and Pinnell running records, quizzes, and check-ins.  In addition to this information, if more than 20% of students in a given 
class are struggling with the same skill, RTI is not needed because the students' problem is not unusual given the performance 
of their peers.  This means that the teacher should revisit the skill or topic and should focus on the instructional core, following 
up with class-wide measures at least every 6 weeks.  If the students' problem is unusual given peers' performance, then the 
teacher should provide targeted intervention in the specific skills and follow up with formative assessments every 3-6 weeks.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data reveals that general education students who are ELLs tend to acquire speaking and listening skills at a much quicker 
pace than they acquire skills in reading and writing (regardless of age and native language proficiency). As they are immersed 
in using English to communicate in all four modalities, our ELLs make steady progress in all areas. Our SWD who are also ELLs 
seem to acquire speaking  and listening skills at a rate that is fairly consistent with the GE population; however, if they don’t 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

 

make progress in reading and writing by grade 2, there is a reduced likelihood that they will be able to score at the 
commanding level on the NYSESLAT. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Every September, the teachers all receive a data folder to analyze to see how their instruction impacted the students.  During 
this time the teachers take notes of what worked and what might have to be tweaked in their instruction based on the 
data.  We also have professional learning communities and an ELL cohort, where teachers gather to share ideas, practices and 
strategies for helping our ELLs make sufficient progress. Moreover, programs and possible adjustments are discussed during 
SLT meetings so that we are able to get both parent and faculty input on our programs based on the data reviewed. Parent 
workshops are also offered 1-2 times per year so that parents have the opportunity to discuss the programs and inquire about 
other programs that are available or that can be offered. ELLs are regularly brought up at our PPT/RTI/AIS meetings in order to 
ensure that they are given appropriate services throughout the year and with attention to their individual learning and 
language needs. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our school provides ELL services through the Freestanding English as a New Language program model. The ENL 
teacher is dually certified in TESOL (grades K-12) as well as Early Childhood and Common Branches (grades N-6). 
Students are grouped by grade level and proficiency level. The integrated groups that are serviced are taught by the 
ENL teacher that pushes into the classroom alongside the classroom teacher.  Most of our ENL students on each of 
the grade levels are in the same class; if they are not in the same class they are pulled into a group and serviced by the 
dually certified ENL teacher.  The ENL teacher collaborates with the classroom teacher on a weekly basis so that 
students are receiving instruction on the same skills in both classrooms.  Students that require services in the stand 
alone model receive services in a pull-out group with the ENL teacher. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

At PS 186, we do not have a TBE program.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

At PS 186, we do not have a DL program. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

At PS 186, our program is designed as a free standing ENL program.   Presently we have 4 Newcomers, receiving 0-3 years in 
ENL, and 3 Former ELLs.  We currently do not have any SIFE or Long-Term ELLs in our program.  All students are served 
according to the new NYS mandate as required under CR Part 154.2  Entering and Emerging students receive 360 minutes per 
week of instruction in both stand-alone ENL and integrated ENL services. Transitioning and Expanding students receive 180 
minutes of instruction per week through integrated ENL services.  Lastly, the Commanding students receive 90 minutes of ENL 
instruction through integrated ENL services.  The school staff ensures that the mandated instructional time is provided in each 
model.  The staff works together to provide children with their required time and follows all mandated guidelines.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
All classes are taught in English using a balanced literacy approach to incorporate the new Common Core Learning Standards 
(CCLS).  The ENL teacher confers with classroom teachers regularly and aligns the ENL curriculum to the classroom.  Content 
area curriculum is presented by classroom teachers, as well as the Science teacher, and concepts are scaffolded in the ENL 
program.  Concepts are often reintroduced using ENL strategies to achieve understanding.  The material becomes 
comprehensible to our ELLs without watering down the content.  Content area vocabulary is a strong focus. These strategies 
make core curriculum accessible to our ELLs.  Specific strategies will be used for every Common Core State Standard to enable 
our ELLs to meet these standards.  Resources from the Common Core library will be utilized to support the academic progress 
of our ELLs. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

At PS 186, we have a number of staff members who are proficient in other languages (Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, 
Bengali, Punjabi). We utilize these professionals to assist us with translation services. In the event that a student arrives and 
we do not have the personnel to help, we immediately call the translation unit for assistance. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. We currently do not have any SIFE students in our school.  However, the following programs and interventions are available 
should any SIFE students be enrolled throughout the school year: AIS programs and RTI programs. In addition, teachers would 
implement strategies to help these students move forward such as establishing partnerships within classrooms. Flexible and 
differentiated groupings would be established to meet these students' needs . ENL and AIS teachers could push-in to provide 
additional support for these students. At-risk counseling would be provided by our Guidance Counselor and Parent 
Coordinator would become a home-school liaison to enhance the partnerships between the school staff and the child's family.  
b. Newcomers are paired with a helper, either another student of staff member that speaks their home language, if 
possible.  Newcomers meet with the school counselor and ENL teacher in order to help ease the transition into a new country 
and school. The ENL teacher works alongside the classroom teacher to help make lessons comprehensible to newcomer 
students. 
c. Developing ELL students are also paired with a partner in class that can serve as a language role model, a student who shows 
commanding proficiency of the English language. The classroom teacher and ENL teacher plan for multiple entry points in their 
lessons in order to help foster the language development of these developing ELL students. 
d. Long term ELL's schoolwork is evaluated to see which modalities are in need of improvement. The ENL teacher then focuses 
on improving students' skills in these areas (listening, speaking, reading, or writing.) 
e. Former ELLs are serviced for 90 minutes a week by the ENL teacher. The ENL teacher works alongside the classroom teacher 
to determine areas that these students needs improvement in. The work is differentiated depending on what the students 
needs to work on. The ENL teacher will provide services to these students by co-teaching with the classroom teacher through a 
push in model. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
For the most part, students with disabilities and ELLs are exposed to the same curriculum and materials as all other students. 
We use the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project as the basis of our literacy instruction and EnVisions Math for math 
instruction. SWD and ELLs also use the Fundations, Wilson, Great Leaps, Reading Recovery, and Jr. Great Books programs when 
appropriate. Students are put into flexible groups based on abilities, preferred learning styles, modalities of instruction, etc. 
and instructed in ways that help them to compensate for their disabilities. The use of tech. devices (ex: pencil grips, laptops, 
special chairs, etc.) also help SWD-ELLs as do testing modifications and accommodations.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
PS 186 is almost  entirely inclusive, so there are a minimum of 2 teachers in almost every classroom who can attend to the 
specific goals of SDW-ELLs. Students are flexibly programmed into other classrooms for subjects that they find challenging or 
for classes in which they excel. All teachers have been trained in Special Education strategies to help students with learning 
disabilities, Speech and Language impairments, and Autism. Classrooms are equipped with microphone systems, trackers, 
"fidgets," etc. in order to assist students. Teachers have also received training that parallels the strategies used for SWD and 
ELLs. This training has allowed them to create lessons for of their students (regardless of academic level or exceptionality) that 
are appropriate and engaging within the LRE. Additional programs and resources available to our students include SETTS, RTI, 
daily AIS,  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
We provide many opportunities for targeted intervention in all content areas.  Some of the interventions available are targeted 
small group work, AIS programs, push in/pull out programs, Castlewood Prep classes, and Fundations/Wilson classes.  Students 
requiring native language assistance are provided with iPads/laptops in order to assist them with their translations needs (ex: 
Google translate).  Other programs afforded to our students include SPIRE, LLI, RAZ Kids, Brain Pop). Due to our small 
population of ELLs, they are provided the same opportunities as the general population.  Our ELL students continue to receive 
interventions noted above even if they reach English proficiency. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We will continue to improve our newer programs such as LLI and Reading Recovery. we will also add Great Leaps and Jr. Great 
Books to our repertoire of programs. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

None 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELL students in grades 3-5 are eligible to attend Castlewood Prep, our before and after-school test preparation program for 
the NYS ELA and Mathematics assessments.  A few of our ELL students attend our after-school program run by the Samuel 
Field Y where they are included in all activities.  ELL students and their families are invited to attend all Family Nights and 
Movie Nights hosted throughout the year.  In Grade 4 we have a Hip-Hop Dancing program which all ELL students participate 
fully.  In essence, ELL students fully participate in all school programs and activities offered throughout the year.   All ELL 
students are fully integrated into all school activities. They participate in activities such as learning to play the recorder, singing 
in Fall and Winter concerts, and also get to choose which Enrichment Cluster they would like to attend. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
In every class we cater to all learning styles, needs, and preferences by providing visual, kinesthetic, and tactile activities to 
support English Language Learners.  We have Smart Boards as well as iPads and/or laptops in all classrooms.  Also, teachers 
use many programs (such as Boardmaker, to provide picture support, Google translate, RAZ Kids, Starfall, A-Z Learning, Brain 
Pop, Goformative, Moby Max, Great Leaps, Jr. Great Books, etc) in order to give the students that which they require.  All 
materials are age and grade appropriate.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Some ways that native language support is delivered in our ENL program is through the use of multilanguage literature, staff 
translation and the use of technology in translation aps on the iPad and through Google translate.

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

PS 186 ensures that all required services support and correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels by using appropriate grade and 
instructional level materials and by following the mandated time according to the CR part 154.2. We have an ELA cohort for PD 
that offers specific strategies to teachers focusing on Language acquisition. In addition, we are a TCRWP school that modifies 
the units of study (with the help of a TC staff developer) for ELLs. Our EnVisions math program also has supplemental materials 
for ELLs and translated texts that we employ. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
In every class we cater to all learning styles, needs, and preferences by providing visual, kinesthetic, and tactile activities to 
support English Language Learners. 98% of our classes are inclusive, so materials and resources are shared by both sites. We 
have Smart Boards in all classrooms and shared spaces (ex: the library and Auditorium). Our PE teacher and that of our co-
located school (P224) collaborate in order for all students to access the gym and the PE/Health curriculum. We have an 
integrated Student Council and Kindness committee that work together, with teachers from both sites, to make certain that all 
students are able to effectively take part in all aspects of the school. At several times throughout the year, joint parent 
workshops are offered. Lastly, we share our clinical staff in an effort to make sure that students are recommended for 
appropriate services and programs. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ELLs and their families are invited to attend a Kindergarten Orientation where they hear all about our school 
and are given a tour of the building.  Older students also receive a tour of the school at the time of their registration.  The 
Parent Coordinator gives parents information about the school, neighborhood and nearby free adult ESL classes.      
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We do not offer any language electives.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We currently do not have a dual language program. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our Teachers College Reading and Writing Project staff developers will work on improving our small group instructional 
strategies that support English language development in reading and writing.  The ENL teacher attends monthly network and 
citywide professional development as well as Teachers College Reading and Writing calendar days as needed throughout the 
year.  During the Monday afternoon professional learning sessions, our ENL teacher will then turn-key this information to the 
staff, including the principal, assistant principal, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, psychologists, occupational, physical 
and speech therapists, secretaries and the parent coordinator.  We provide professional development that assists teachers in 
preparing our ELLs for standardized testing in grades 3-5.  The ENL teacher also provides professional development on the 
NYSESLAT for classroom teachers during grade conferences.  Monthly congruence between ENL teacher and classroom 
teachers are held. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

 

ENL teachers have received Professional Learning opportunities at the Network and district levels about the CCLS, methods of 
instruction, etc. They have returned to school to turnkey this information to other classroom teachers. Additionally, all 
teachers have been trained by TCRWP staff developers on how to use the program to assist ELLs with language development. 
Lastly, consultants from Pearson and Jr. Great Books have presented so that teachers are well-versed in how to instruct ELLs in 
an effective manner.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
As part of our PD Plan, we contact the ENL teacher in our Middle Schools (172 and 67) so that they can provide our fifth grade 
classroom teachers with the information they need to support our ELLs as they transition to the Middle Schools.  As the 
designated Middle School liaison, the Guidance Counselor attends P.D. sessions that are targeted to enable her to meet her 
responsibilities in this role, i.e., understanding the Middle School choice selection process.   Information is shared with the 
terminal grade teachers and the Parent Coordinator.  They provide additional support for families during this process.  Our 
translators are available to assist, when needed. Furthermore, "Jose P training" is woveb throughout the PD 
opportunuties given to teachers so that they have a firm grasp on the principles of language acquisition and a clear 
undrstanding of each level of the NYSESLAT. 
At PS 186, we engage in Professional Learning Communities that look at students work and keep track of data, patterns, and 
trends so that planning can be done around the students' areas of difficulty. In order to check to make sure that the 
proper/required percentage of time is spent conducting these types of Professional learning, we have a file of agendas and 
attendance sheets. 
Our ENL teacher is a regular member of the ELL cohort as well as all district, borough, and state learning opportunities offered. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
During the Tuesday Parent Engagement time, the parents of our ELLs will be invited in for a conference to discuss their child's 
progress, needs and goals.  At these meetings, the parents will have an opportunity to express their needs and wants and to 
make sure we take every step to accommodate these needs.  Attendance and minutes will be recorded at these 
conferences.  Translators are scheduled to be in the school building during these meetings. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
ELL parent attendance records at annual individual meetings are maintained through sign in sheets.  The sheets are kept on file 
with the ENL teacher and copies are given to the Parent Coordinator. 
Parents are scheduled to attend Parent Teacher Conferences as well as encouraged to participate in all classroom activities, 
such as, writing and reading celebrations throughout the year.  We also offer many Family Events, such as Family Fitness, Art 
Night, STEM Night, Scavenger Hunt, and take your Dad to school day to name a few.  Also, every December our school hosts a 
multicultural celebration during which parents are invited to come in and share some items from their culture.  Some parents 
share jewelry, music, songs, dances and books from their native country.  All ELL parents are encouraged to participate in all 
parent workshops throughout the year.   We use the Parent Coordinator email distribution system to make sure that parents 
have up to date information on district and citywide learning opportunities.  Monthly classroom newsletters are also sent 
home highlighting student learning by grade.  Any information sent home is translated into the parents native language or it is 
stamped *Important – Please have translated. All correspondence is sent home in the students' native language. For lower 
incidence languages (such as some Asian languages, Spanish, and Portuguese, we employ school-based personal fro 186 or , P 
224, or neighboring schools.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Melissa Haidary, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At enrollment, our ENL teacher or Parent Coordinator meets with parents to find out the child's home language. 
The ENL teacher also reviews the following ATS report RAPL to determine written translation and oral 
interpretation needs. Based on the home language information for each child, school notices are sent home in 
various languages but mostly in English.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of a school emergency measures (such as the use of Translation and Interpretation services and the use 
of staff members who are fluent in particular languages such as Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Punjabi, Portuguese, 
Italian...) will be taken to contact parents with Limited English Proficiency. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Teachers will be informed of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 during the Back to School Faculty Conference in 
September. At that time, the goals will be reviewed as will the resources available to them. All of this information will 
then be uploaded by our ENL Coordinator onto the Outlook 365 One Drive. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

At PS 186, we adhere to all regulations regarding parental notification requirements for translation and interpretation 
services. All parent notices that are sent home are either sent in the parents primary language or stamped *Important 
- Please translate* written in many other languages. Parents are also notified of translation services through signs that 
are displayed throughout the building. The parent coordinator will also be able to help any parents get the required 
translation services. As stated before, we have many teachers, paraprofessionals, security officer and school nurse 
who also are available to translate any verbal or written communication. Parents who primarily speak a covered 
language and who require language assistance receive a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities. Staff 
have printed sheets which list the languages available for interpretation services. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parents will be asked through a survey about how they rate the quality and availability of services. This will also be a 
topic discussed during SLT and PTA meetings. Information will be gathered from parents of all cultures and languages.
