Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our Mission Statement 

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

Our school’s mission is to provide students with the opportunity to perform and shine in the classroom, on stage, and 
in life; to prepare a diverse group of students to be intelligent, caring leaders in society.  

We strive to create and maintain a trusting, collaborative and safe learning environment while encouraging and 
expecting a high level of parental involvement. At HSVD, parents, students and staff work together to provide 
opportunities to meet the needs of every learner and we offer a college preparatory program that values higher-level 
thinking and artistic expression. Our School Leadership Team and Parent Association are actively engaged in the 
culture at HSVD.  

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Our school’s mission to provide students with the opportunity to shine and perform in the classroom, on stage and in 
life and to prepare them to be caring leaders in society is built upon the idea of the High School for Violin and Dance 
(HSVD) familia. We believe that by working together, building relationships on trust and providing opportunities for 
relationships to grow both inside and outside of the classroom, we can create an environment that supports students, 
families and staff. Furthermore, we use the school’s values of the “3As and 3Cs”: Attendance, Academics, Attitude 
and Confidence, Commitment and College and Career, as the basis for all of our collaboration and work. Keeping 
these values at the forefront of our school, allows us to remain focused on our goals and maintain consistency in our 
work. 

This year we will make a concerted effort to enhance our current level of collective efficacy so that all staff express 
and hold beliefs and expectations (and act consistently with them) that all of our students can learn at high levels. We 
intend to maintain a professional discourse that focuses on student learning and not mere attention to compliance or 
"doing things the right way" and not, "doing things right." A key strategy in this area will be for the school principal to 
provide high quality feedback to all school staff (and to encourage them to do the same) that measures the impact of 
practice on students' achievement. The use of inquiry during common planning time is also expected to support 
collective problem-solving and a paradigm shift among staff that views student learning as the result of staff actions 
and whatever the outcomes; this is data that can be used for future efforts. 

In order to support staff and students as they build relationships both in and outside of the classroom, we have 
implemented two important strategies. Based on feedback from students, we now plan monthly/ bi-monthly staff and 
student games. This allows collaboration among students and staff in a different setting outside of the classroom, 
which in turn, allows for teachers and students to have different experiences together and see each other in a 
different light. Similarly, through our partnership with one of our CBO partners, Educational Alchemy, we have 
created Project Familia, an advisory type program in which students and staff share goals, reflect on their experiences 
and create plans for themselves and their futures. Both of these settings create opportunities that reflect our mission 
statement while also creating the space for staff and students to deepen their relationships. We also have developed 
the Project I.AM. Program, which allows interested students to develop a message they want to share with the 
community through the arts. This program gives students a voice to be heard, provides them with time to share their

to improve. It is our belief, that these initiatives will lead to stronger relationships and that the relationships that we 
build within our school community, are the foundation upon which all our work is done. 

It has been a focus of our school to improve our student’s literacy skills in all areas: reading, writing, speaking and 
listening. These skills are essential to success in College and Career as well as in the 21st Century. As such, our Literacy 
Coach has continued to develop our Literacy Plan and each year we build upon the initiatives we have created in our 
classrooms and the Professional Development we provide to teachers so that they can teach and support our 
students. In the classroom, we have implemented Drop Everything and Write (DEAW) and Drop Everything and Read 
(DEAR). Implementing these strategies have ensured that reading and writing will take place across all classrooms and 
will not be limited to the humanities. One day each week, every department provides time for DEAW and DEAR in 
order for students to put the skills they are learning in class, into practice. In terms of Professional Development, the 
English and Language Arts teachers are receiving training in Judith Hochman’s Writing Revolution and have turn-
keyed this training to our staff. Through the implementation of the Writing Revolution strategies in classes, on a daily 
basis, we have already seen improvement in student writing. This year, we plan on using strategies such as Because, 
But, and So to also support students in developing their speaking skills and academic vocabulary. Lastly, our work with 
Writing Revolution will continue to drive this year’s inquiry work.  

We also want to ensure that all of our teachers, no matter their level of expertise or experience, feel supported and 
are given the Professional Development and coaching that they need to improve their practice. Each year, when we 
meet with teachers at the beginning and end of year meetings, we identify areas in which they want and need to 
further develop. As we create our Professional Development calendar and identify the coaches from the Field Support 
Center and Teacher’s College, we keep these needs in mind. Data from ADVANCE is also used to set up inter-
visitations among staff, providing them with the opportunity to learn from each other and follow up by sharing what 
they learned with an administrator or coach. This year, we also have two of our English and Language Arts teachers 
participating in city’s teacher leader programs (Teacher Leader and Peer Collaborative Teacher). Through their 
participation in these programs, their classrooms will be opened up as Lab Classrooms for this school year. Through 
the process they will be able to support other teachers, in and outside of our community, and will also grow 
themselves as teachers and as leaders.  

Finally, in order to provide teachers with the time and opportunity to collaborate we have adjusted our schedule to 
include Common Planning time. This time will be used for: ICT teachers to plan and collaborate, grade level and 
departments to meet and plan for their classes, and to work on our inquiry projects for the school year. Our staff 
works very hard and we hope that by creating time for collaboration, we will elevate the work that we do and the 
pedagogical practices of our teachers.

opportunities to meet the needs of every learner and we offer a college preparatory program that values higher-level 
thinking and artistic expression. Our School Leadership Team and Parent Association are actively engaged in the 
culture at HSVD.  

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Needs  

Infuse higher level Depth of Knowledge Questions into teaching and learning 

 
  Engage students in a deeper level of discussion via strategies such as turn and talk, think-pair-share and 

making thinking visible 
Improve student writing through the implementation of Writing Revolution strategies 
Increase the level of rigor across the curriculum 
Focus on the Chancellor's expectation that equity in excellence in made available to all school constituents. 

 
 
 

Our strategies for addressing these areas are as follows: 

  Creating and using a tennis chart that will allow teachers and administrators to efficiently assess teacher 

strengths and weaknesses and use the classroom data to plan school wide and individual professional 
development. 

  Create time and opportunity for teachers to share curriculum and lessons and to make an effort to lessen the 

scaffolds provided to students as they near the end of the year and their Regents exams. 

  Train teachers in the use of new assessment strategies such as Plickers and White Boards, so that they receive 

timely classroom data that can be used immediately or in the near future to modify instruction and grouping 
accordingly. 

  Train teachers in Data Driven Differentiated instruction, to better meet student needs and lesson plans.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans  

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 3 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
3.2 

The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of 
rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students. 

3.3 

3.4 

3.5 

Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction 
(DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and 
address student achievement needs. 

The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner 
within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the 
arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities. 
Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative 
assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student 
reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: 

  Common Planning time has been created in teacher schedules, providing the time and opportunity for teachers 

to collaboratively examine data and inform their curriculum and daily lesson planning. (End of Year Data) 

  Teachers have been using classroom formative assessment trackers to make data based instructional decisions 

 

in their lesson plans. (Direct Observation of Practice) 
For the past three years we have developed and implemented a Literacy Plan, that has led to teachers having 
language objectives in their daily lesson plans as evidenced by an increase in reading and writing across all 
classrooms and content areas. (2018 PPO) 

Needs: 

  While we have maintained our graduation rate, moving by one point in the past year, we recognize that we 

need to continue to improve our rate. (2018 NYSED School Report Card) 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           16 

 

Student performance on Regents exams represents the greatest challenge to graduating with one's cohort. 

 
  Teachers need support in Data Driven Differentiated Instruction to meet the needs of the diverse learners in 

their classrooms (2018 Principal PPO). 

  Teachers needs to create student investment and ownership in their learning and prepare students to self-

 

reflect and evaluate (2018 School Self Reflection). 
Student attendance needs to be improved and monitored more closely with regular routines and protocols that 
involve both staff and students (2018 Principal PPO).  

  There needs to be more consistency in pedagogical practices among teachers around task differentiation, 

purposeful grouping and strategic employment of adults in the classroom (2018 Principal PPO).  

  Teachers need to reduce the number of scaffolds provided to students in the Spring semester to create more 

self-efficacy among students and to prepare them for Regents exams (2018 Principal PPO).  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
As a result of our utilization of data-driven structures and routines and assessment strategies that are embedded in the 
Data Wise process, by August 2019, 80% of a group of currently “off-track” students (approximately 20 identified in 
September) from cohorts U, V and W will be “on-track” by August 2019.

Who will be 
targeted? 

Timeline 
What is the 
start and 
end date? 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-need 
student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE, 
STH). 

Teachers will utilize school-created planning templates to guide the 
creation of effective daily, weekly and unit lesson plans that use 
data to address the needs of all students -- particularly SWDs and 
ELLS -- by: designing purposeful scaffolds; ensuring that instructional 
plans include multiple access points for all students to content and 
tasks;  

All teachers, 
all grade 
levels. 

ensuring that lessons include higher-order questions; ensuring that 
Regents aligned tasks are used as a component of assessment plans: 
and,  

ensuring high levels of student intellectual engagement and/or 
productive struggle. 

Teachers will continue to receive training in the implementation of 
the CCLS aligned Writing Revolution strategies - particularly in the 
area of using evidence to support argumentative writing and 
discourse. Teachers will incorporate these strategies into their 
lesson plans and evaluate their effectiveness through the use of 
open-ended and/or constructed-response Regents type tasks.  

All teachers, 
all grade 
levels. 

A protocol that incorporates expectations and success criteria for 
student learning; student self and peer assessment, tracking of 
individual performance and reflection on next steps for learning will 
be used as part of the assessment process. The protocol will also 
include student feedback for instruction. 

 

The school will develop and implement an Assessment/Uniform 
Grading Policy that describes effective assessment practices and

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
By the first Parent Teacher Conference in September 2018, families of off track Cohort U students will be invited in to 
meet with a counselor and/or administrator to review the action plan for graduation for the student. 

Before the end of the Fall semester, families of off track Cohort U students will meet with school counselors and/or 
administrators two more times. 

By the end of the Fall semester, families of off track Cohort V and W students will have been invited in for individual 
conferences to review the action plan for their students.  

The Parent Association will hold one workshop each semester around Graduation Requirements, Transcripts and 
Academic Intervention Services offered to students who are off track for graduation. 

Before the end of the Spring semester, families of off track Cohort U students will meet with school counselors and/or 
administrators two times in an effort to make sure students are following their action plan. 

By the end of the Spring semester, families of off track Cohort V and W students will have been invited in for 
individual conferences to review the action plan for their students.  

Home visits will be made through out the school year for any of the families that we are unable to contact. 
 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
Common Planning time will be used 1-2 days a week for teachers to engage in work using student data.  

Achievement Team meetings (1-2 per month) will be used for teachers to engage in the sharing of lessons and 
curriculum (Tuning Protocol) and the use of DDI protocols.  

After school outreach time (Tuesdays from 2:30-3:50PM) will be used to contact parents of targeted students and 
inform them of student progress and how they can support.

Part 5 – Progress Monitoring  

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
Mid-point benchmark: At the conclusion of each marking period each identified "off track" student group will be 
reviewed to determine who is "on" or "off" track to graduate (with the goal of 90%) using scholarship reports, 
Regents passing rates (mid-year) and end of unit assessments that incorporate open-ended and/or constructed-
response Regents tasks.  

Teacher artifacts that reflect planning and assessment activity as well as observation feedback will be used to 
measure fidelity of implementation and teacher effectiveness in the above described areas.  

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
Scholarship reports 

Regents data 

End-of-unit assessments. 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

Strengths: 

  We have a robust team that meets around student attendance issues on a regular basis since the spring term 

began and will continue to do so throughout the school year. 

  At every meeting the team looks at data and engages in discussions on how to improve school wide attendance. 
  Target groups have been established and team members have had conversations with students about their 

attendance issues. 

  The agenda and minutes of all the meetings were taken and given to all team members (hard copies and 

electronic copies). 

  Daily phone calls were made to communicate to parents that their child was absent from school. 
  At the beginning of the school year, several home visits were conducted for absentee students. 

Needs: 

 

Student attendance rate is low at 67 % with 54 % of students chronically absent students.

  Every team member must be committed to attend every scheduled meeting and prioritize our initiative to 

improve our school wide attendance. 

  A consistent data protocol needs to be established and used to look at the ats reports to assist in creating next 

steps. 

  A robust incentive plan needs to be created to help support conversations with students and motivate them to 

 

attend school. 
Students who become Long Term Absentees (especially the over aged/under credit) need to be provided other 
opportunities of success and if those opportunities aren't successful, they need to go through an effective 407 
process to minimize the decrease in school wide attendance. 

  We need to establish a log of electronic running minutes where all team members can have access, add/edit 

and be able to see all documents for the entire school year (ie-google doc). 

  Daily student attendance needs to be taken earlier in the day (ie-period 2 instead of period 3) so phone calls can 

be made to communicate to parents that their child is absent and needs to come to school.  

  One central parent messenger system (ie. Skedula) needs to be used to allow teachers to send live text 

messages to parents to communicate absences (ie-io classroom). 

  Although there will be weekly meetings with the attendance team, there also needs to be monthly meetings 

where ALL teachers are communicated attendance updates. 

  A protocol needs to be established to observe and evaluate the classroom environment to assure students are 

supported as best as possible (ie-Collaborative Ghost Walk protocol).  

  Home visits need to occur all year long to address the the absentee students. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
As a result of our consistent review of attendance data and our coordinated responses (e.g., counseling, parent 
outreach, teacher involvement, etc.) to it, by the end of June 2019, the number of chronically absent students will be 
reduced by 10 % or from 46 students to 40 students.

Each week specific student data will be reviewed by team members and on a monthly basis we will analyze data by 
grade to measure whether or not we are meeting/approaching the annual attendance goal. By the beginning of 
February (mid-year) we will analyze the school's to date percentage and determine if we can increase the goal by at 
least another 2%.

In addition the Special Education students (freshmen, sophomore, and juniors) end of year attendance rate will 
improve by a minimum of 5% (60% end of year 2018) to 65%. In addition we will decrease our chronic absentees 
percentage from 70% to 65%.  

The attendance team will look at attendance data from end of year 2018 and identify 10 freshman, 10 sophomores, 
10 juniors and 6 seniors to target and support in an effort to increase the attendance percentage. Half of those 
students will be special education students (5 freshman, 5 sophomores, 5 juniors and 3 seniors) so their attendance 
can be supported. There will be 2-3 team members per grade of which one will be either a guidance counselor or 
social worker.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

We will develop and implement data-driven protocols that utilize 
the Data Wise approach for developing and monitoring daily, 
weekly and unit instructional plans to ensure that content, tasks 
and assessment activity is aligned with the CCLS and NYS content 
standards and adapted for SWDs and ENL students. 

We will use daily common planning time to support the effective 
collaboration of teacher teams (using the Data Wise approach) 
through the use of protocols that guide their examination of 
student work for evidence of learning and gaps and the use of 
data findings to accelerate learning for all students including SE 
and ENL students, as well as specific students who are off track. 
Student work will be used to provide evaluative feedback 
regarding strategies and to identify new strategies or re-teach.  

Students will be involved in self and peer assessment of Regents 
aligned tasks that incorporate the use of rubrics, the opportunity 
to reflect on outcomes and the opportunity to provide teachers 
with feedback regarding the teaching and learning process. 

A Professional Learning Plan will be designed to build teacher 
capacity in those strategy and skill areas targeted in the school's 
improvement plan.

survey parents and other caretakers at the beginning of each semester to elicit from them ways to accommodate 
their participation in school workshops. 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Conferences are held with teachers and school administrators to discuss their needs and concerns and to address the 
respective concerns and needs. Professional Development, Coaching, Peer Classroom visitations, In-school and off-
site professional development opportunities are made available to teachers based on both interest and need. We 
continue to collaborate with Columbia University's Teachers' College to facilitate relevant and meaningful 
professional development based on teachers' needs and students' academic achievement data. 

 

Teachers engage in monthly, relevant and meaningful professional development that is facilitated by Columbia 
University's Teachers' College. Teacher teams continue to work addressed at these PD sessions as they meet weekly 
to plan, implement, revisit and revise strategies learned during Teacher College PD sessions in order to build capacity 
among grade levels and departments.  

 

Higher performing teachers (based on ADVANCE data and respective student scholarship data) facilitate professional 
development designed to model effective instructional strategies that promoted student learning and progress as 
shown by their respective data.

Teachers' ADVANCE data is based on classroom observations both formal and informal. The information gathered 
from classroom observations is references to provide specific feedback provided to each teacher along with additional 
resources to support them in needed areas of growth. Follow-up classroom observations and conferences are 
scheduled with teachers to monitor and adjust the individual, differentiated support they need to. Formal and 
informal conferences are scheduled with teachers based on teachers' individual scholarship data to identify struggling 
students and to discuss strategies teachers can implement to support struggling students.  
 
Teachers are paired with department teams and grade level teams to engage in peer discussions around student 
engagement and motivation. In addition, teachers facilitate professional development sessions to build capacity 
around instructional strategies that result in higher student achievement.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48 

 
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. High School of Violin and Dance, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

[The High School for Violin and Dance will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

● Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

● Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. The school will maintain this information.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● Provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report

● Host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:

Begin description here:            
In serving our ELL population, we plan on strengthening their learning in core subject areas by 
targeting writing, in an effort to increase graduation rates.  We want to create an after school and 
Saturday small group instruction where the teachers (Polonia, Klavansky,  and Madera) focus on 
providing students opportunities to engage in rigorous reading and response in an oral and 
written fashion. While all modalities are a target, the NYSELAT data shows writing 
improvements are imperative in the success of English Language Learners. Their writing skills 
significantly lag over the other three modalitles. It prevents them from reaching a commanding 
level of  language proficiency.  We intend on making writing comprehensive through speaking 
both formally and informally in groups to both familiar and unfamiliar audiences  in order to 
discuss concepts they have read. In addition, students will continue to learn Writing Revolution 
strategies. Text will be scaffolded using graphic illustrations and video clips pertaining to the 
content at hand. Research shows students of today are strong visual learners thus using 
technology (smart board & ELMO) as a resource is necessary.  For entering and emerging ELLs 
visuals are instrumental to their general understanding of content. In addition taking down notes 
based on the video they have watched will provide them with opportunities to enhance their 
listening skills which is also an area in the NYSELAT, that data shows needs improvement. All 
English Language Learners are encouraged to attend the afterschool program for supplemental 
help. However the 12th and 11th graders are our major targets. Many of the them are missing 
regents making them at risk of graduating. The language of instruction is English, while Spanish 
can be used to help the entering and emerging students who have very little to no command of 
English. The types of certified teachers will include:  an ENL teacher Ms. Klavansky., Special 
Education teacher Ms Polonia (fluent in Spanish), and  Ms. Madera ELA content area teacher 
(fluent in Spanish). The key here is to utilize integrated co-teaching to make content accessible. 
The Special Education teacher along with the ENL teacher  will differentiate the activities. The 
structure will be three times a week for an hour (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday). 
The Friday & Saturday will focus on reading (non fiction text) and writing with our ELA content 
teacher specialists Ms. Madera as well as regents prep.  OnWednesday  Ms. Klavansky will 
engage the entering and emerging students ELL students in dramatic theater presentations and 
poems based on topic eg. If talking about the Neolithic Revolution students will act out what 
humans did pre and post Neolithic revolution.  On Thursday, Ms. Polonia will work with the 
transitioning, commanding and expanding  ELLs students, that the data shows are closest to 
passing the NYSELAT exam (based off last years data) she will prep them with strategies to 
approach the taking of the NYSELAT with a focus on writing. Lastly, the final component of 
will be supporting the students in passing their NYS regents exams which will occur on 
Saturdays from 10-1pm. This regents prep class will be taught by Ms. Madera starting the 
month of November, beginning on the 7th and continuing throughout the school year until June

Begin description here:            
  
Beginning August 2018 until June 2019, our teachers will engage in professional development 
that addresses our ELL population. Every first Monday of the month our teachers Ms. Polonia, 
Ms. Klavansky and Ms. Madera will gather to create an agenda for their subsequent 
Departmental Meetings that are connected to the focus of our "FIRST MONDAY P.D." 
sessions .  Their focus will be to infuse the understanding and skills acquired during our school-
wide professional development sessions.   Our ELL teachers will meet monthly with content area 
teachers after school to discuss research-based strategies that can be implemented across the 
curriculum with an emphasis on the shifts and the CCLS to engage all our ELL's in rigor and 
literacy across all subjects which will be paid through Title III funds . Strategies to be 
implemented are scaffolding, differentiated instruction, assessment for learning, data 
driven instruction, academic rigor and testing modifications where applicable.  ELL teachers will 
also meet with our Special Education teachers to explore and deliver specialized and targeted 
instruction to our ELL students with special needs.  This instruction will be aligned with their 
ability to perform based on their diagnosed disabilities. Our schedule will allow for one common 
planning time period a day which will support teachers meeting and giving each other feedback 
on their lessons. They will use a protocol and we believe they will be able to improve one 
another instruction. In addition to the professional development and collaboration mentioned 
above, these three teachers will be receiving professional development using Writing Revolution 
Strategies and coaching through the BFSC as well as data driven instruction, differentiated 
instruction, academic rigor with focus on: Sustaining Academic Rigor, Maintaining High

students which will be funded by title III. Besides the sessions mentioned and additional two 
professional development sessions will occur that will focus on Infusing Technology. One 
session will focus on the Smart board and the other on the use of technology such as the Electric 
Light Magnifying Object  (ELMO). Teachers need to receive strategies in order to support the 
ELL students in their content area. Teacher training will target Social Studies, Math, Science and 
English teachers. These PDs will take place on Monday during PD sessions . Core teachers will 
be given strategies on how to assist ELLs from text stair casing, multiple entry points, annotation 
for close reading, text layering, academic vocabulary, audio and visual scaffolding. Topics to be 
covered include increasing vocabulary and inference skills school wide in addition to Common 
Core ELA, Math, Global and US History Regents prep. ESL Teacher Ms. Klavansky will 
provide in-house professional training to content area teachers. Ms. Madera and Ms. Klavansky 
as a result have been turn keying  strategies on how to embed language objectives into lesson 
plans. Teachers are encouraged to provide the English Language Learners the language they 
need in order to complete the task. This is done through text structures. In addition 
Ms. Klavansky is turn keying the four part series on Integrated English as a New Language: Co-
Teaching for ELLs. Outside Professional development will come from how to use effectively the 
resources like National Geographic Edge Common Core Aligned.

 Parents are our partners at H.S.V.D.  They are invited to visit our teachers four times a year, 
including and not limited to student performances.   We engage our parents in workshops and 
invite guest speakers from the NYCDOE as well as from our Community Based Organizations 
and our on-site Clinic to address parents' concerns as well as inform them of the services we 
provide for their child.    We are sensitive to our parents' needs and purpose to ensure that there 
is a  language interpreter / translator at all meetings and school gatherings.    Two workshops will 
be provided to parents in the Fall, one will be on Engaging your child in their academics and the 
other on Common Core which will be paid through title III funds. Two workshops will be 
provided to parents in the Spring, one on Reading and Writing in both the primary and secondary 
language and the other on Common Core Session II.  These workshops will be organized by the 
school's Parent Coordinator and attended not only by parents but by representatives of the school 
community.  In addition, our parents and encouraged to serve on our school's School Leadership 
Team, along with their child.  Our parents will be invited to receive information that students as 
well will receive around cyber bullying which will be facilitated by our counselors and social 
worker .  We will also share with them the resources that are available for addressing 
Cyberbullying. There is a need to engage the support of parents in student’s acquisition of the 
English language throughout the entire school year. Parent-oriented PD will inform students and 
parents alike about State exams such as the regents in addition to current standing of students and

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We examine the students' scores on the NYSESLAT, periodic assessments, and classroom assessments.  The data shows above 
all that most students' oral abilities outpace their written abilities.  Historically, the vast majority of our students have scored 
higher on the listening/speaking component of the NYSESLAT than on the reading/writing component.  ENL classes therefore 
put greater emphasis on these latter skills.  
  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62 

 

 

Our school's ENL students are pre assessed via individual writing samples and oral conversation to determine the level at 
which they are speaking,reading, and writing in English.  In addition, each of our ENLs are given a technology survey to 
determine their ability to use computers, the Internet and other media sources for academic purposes.  This data is used to 
provide differentiated instruction as well as small group / after school instruction a minimum of three times per week.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Evaluation is an ongoing process .  We meet in grade level and content area meetings bi-weekly.  Our teams meet weekly to 
discuss all manners of issues, including those related to ENLs.  We evaluate our students’ progress based on Periodic 
Assessment exams and ongoing assessments in our classrooms.  Our Data Specialist, Mr. Dan Rubin, produces hard data based 
on Periodic Assessments and standardized testing that informs instructional decisions.  Guidance counselors meet with ELLs 
periodically to monitor their progress on their report cards. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

On-going progress report meetings with students, teachers, counselors, parents including our school's 3As (Attendance, 
Achievement, Attitude) to collaboratively address students' needs and challenges.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We see that most of our students, particularly our significant LTE population, perform markedly better on the Listening and 
Speaking sections compared with Reading and Writing.  The data from both exams indicates similar patterns. For this reason, 
we are offering ENL classes specifically geared toward improving the reading and writing skills of our ELL population. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Teacher Team Meetings, SLT and Parent Association Meetings, Teacher Scholarship data Conferences, Student Report Card 
Data, Collaborative Teacher Curriculum Mapping Review / Revision / Implementation 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Stand-alone  emerging, transitioning, stand alone 5 days a week for 50 minutes classes are given to all students who 
scored at the first two NYSESLAT levles for 315 minutes / week.    They receive ELA instruction through the ESL 
teacher.  In addition, students in all ENL levels are placed in an ELA class co-taught by one certified ESL teacher, Ms. 
Linda Klavansky.  This enables all students to receive more than the minimum ESL class time required.  Those above 
the second NYSESLAT level also take ELA with a certified ELA teacher, as outlined in the charts below.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

We offer a stand-alone ENL program which fulfills the requirements as indicated in the Chart 5.2 below.  Stand-alone 
beginning and intermediate ENL classes are given to all students who scored at the first two NYSESLAT levels for 315 
minutes/week.  Our certified ENL teacher (Linda Klavansky) teaches these classes.  These students receive ELA instruction 
through the ENL teacher.  In addition, students in all ENL levels are placed in an ELA class co-taught by a certified ENL teacher, 
Ms. Linda Klavansky.  This enables all students to receive more than the minimum ESL class time required.  Those above the 
second NYSESLAT level also take ELA with a certified ELA teacher, as outlined in the charts below.  All emerging and 
transitioning ENL students receive their 540 minutes of service.  
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The ENL teacher, Ms. Klavansky,  pushes into classes to the extent required for each level of English proficiency while those 
who are required to take a stand-alone ENL class are taught by a licensed ENL teacher for the appropriate number of minutes. 
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

The bilingual counselo, Lillian Hernandez, r and the ENL teacher, Ms. Linda Klavansky, who is fluent in Spanish, 
interview students to determine fluency in Spanish.  In the case of a new student whose native language is not Spanish and no 
one can be found who speaks that language, the NYCDOE's translation services are used.  In addition, students are asked to 
provide a writing sample in their native language. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

If a student is identified as SIFE, we employ the following procedure: 
  
a.  After a student is identified as SIFE, we schedule teachers to provide three periods a week for homework help and content 
assistance.  These classes are used to help students understand the content and keep up with the work of their core content 
classes.  The ENL teacher interacts with content teachers to see which students need the most help in various subjects. 
  
b.  For newcomers (who are usually beginners) we place the student in an ELL block where an ESL teacher provides support in 
content classes.  In addition, they are given a separate ESL class to work on literacy five days a week. 
  
c.  For students who have been ENLs from four to six years, we use the ICT model to provide support in core classes, and, 
depending on skill level, assign the student to a separate ENL class. 
  
d.   In order to meet the needs of long-term ENLs at HSVD, we have implemented an ENL instructional program in a hybrid 
push-in/pull-out (push-in for content areas; pull-out for the ENL model.  We have found this model to be very effective in 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64 

 

helping and meeting the needs of LTEs to improve their linguistic and academic skills so that they become English proficient, 
meet state standards, and promotion/graduation programs.  
   
e.   Former ENLs who are entitled to services up to two years after exiting ELL status are grouped with the advanced ENLs for 
the classes in which Ms. Klavansky, our certified ENL teacher, co-teaches with the content area teacher.  
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ENLs with Special Needs receive services according to the academic support necessary, as stated in the IEP.  Most of our ENLs 
who are classified as Special Education have very good listening and speaking skills, but they struggle with reading and writing 
in English.  These students are assigned an additional English class with an ENL teacher to help them with their reading and 
writing.  Many of these students have much better skills in English than in Spanish.   A special education teacher (Mr. Smart) 
also pushes into several of their classes.  The ICT model is used in those classes.  The special education teacher oversees 
students' IEP's and determines how to meet each student's needs as  per their individual and respective  IEPs.   For students 
more fluent in Spanish than English, written materials are translated into Spanish.  Glossaries with terms in both languages, 
along with definitions in Spanish, are provided for use during class lessons; glossaries that only translate are used during 
Regents testing.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Students with special needs are grouped within class sections that are co-taught by a licensed Special Education specialist who 
also has an ENL license (Ms. Lewis) and a licensed content area teacher.  These sections contain special-needs and general 
education students together at all times.  A program developed at our school, Extended Time on Task (ETOT), allows students 
to complete work after the assignment is due.  (ETOT is open to all students.)  Students with special needs are also allowed 
extended time on all exams, as stated in their IEP's.  We allow students who need more time in Math to complete courses in 
three semesters rather than two, when appropriate; however, all students are initially given the opportunity to complete these 
courses in two semesters, and are expected to make an effort to do so.  For math and all other academic courses, PM school 
classes allow students to make up credit when necessary.   Also, credit recovery courses are given during the school day that 
allow students to make up missing credits at their own pace with the guidance of a licensed teacher.  SWD's are programmed 
alongside general education students 100% of the time. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
We provide a variety of intervention services. After-school and Saturday tutoring and courses will be available for all ENL 
students, grades 9-12, in all content areas including Global History and Geography, United States History and Government, 
Integrated Algebra, Geometry, and Living Environment.  The students will be prepared for New York State Regents 
examinations.  The goal is to improve language skills and content understanding to ensure success on state 
examinations.  Struggling students are mandated to attend PM school in order to make up for deficient credits and 
skills.  Intervention services are provided in English the majority of the time and struggling students are provided 
differentiated support via additional resources such as online language tools and websites. Struggling students are mandated 
to attend PM school in order to make up for deficient credits and skills.  In addition, peer support is provided to help struggling 
students advance with language acquisition. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are implementing a program, Project BIG, in which older students buddy up with younger students by grade.   The purpose 
of this program is for older students to guide the younger ones through situations that they might be familiar with, but that 
the younger students may not be.  In addition, another new program, Project I AM, will allow students to use various art forms

(dance, music, visual arts) to represent their knowledge of content area subject matter.  This may be a good starting point for 
ENLs who are not fully fluent in English.  A third program, Passport Portfolio, will be introduced in which students are taught 
through special sessions how to navigate important documents that they will encounter throughout their high school careers, 
such as their transcripts and the college essay.  This will be presented by the administration and other staff via special 
classroom visits. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 
No programs are scheduled to be discontinued at the present time. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded all of the same opportunities to participate in any and all school activities.  Information from the school is 
always translated into Spanish so that all students and families have access to important notices and announcements.  Team 
Leaders communicate available activities to the teachers on their teams and those teachers then communicate to the 
students.  The ENL teacher is responsible for making sure that their students are included.   Programs include Recycling Club, 
Campus Garden Club, advanced dance and orchestra, sports teams, book club and events such as dances and recitals.  ENL's 
are also enrolled in all classes alongside English-dominant students.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Materials used to help students develop their skills include videos that teachers download from the Internet (news, story 
summaries) and displayed on Smart Boards.  Teachers also use guided note-taking graphic organizers and have students do 
dictation.  In addition, we utilize word walls with pictures and Spanish translations.  We have four laptop carts and two 
technology labs that we employ for many of our programs and projects.  Curriculum planning and mapping is custom-designed 
to meet our students' needs through the website Rubicon Atlas 
(http://cfn406.rubiconatlas.org/c/pi/v.php/Atlas/Authentication/View/Login).  Written materials in content areas, such as 
readings and assignments, are translated into Spanish for those who require it.   
   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In team-taught content area classes, the language policy varies based on the needs of the students. Whole class instruction is 
always given in English. In addition, reading materials are also in English. Students who have stronger English skills (most of our 
ENLs) do their assignments in English. However, our newcomer students are permitted to write their answers in Spanish. In 
addition, oral translation of the content is provided to these students by the ENL teacher if necessary. This comes in the form 
of responsible code-switching, where when it is clear the student does not understand the material, a summary of the material 
is provided in Spanish. The idea behind this is that in these content area classes, mastery of content is most important and if a 
child needs to make meaning in their native language this should not only be permitted but encouraged. 
  
Newcomer ENLs are provided with testing accommodations including: 
English and Spanish language versions of both in-class and Regents assessments in the content area. 
Bilingual dictionaries for ELA class and the Regents. 
  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Materials used are written for high school students and reflect themes relevant to adolescents.  For example, novels such as 
"The Outsiders" and "Johnny Tremain," written on a high-interest level with outsider and coming-of-age themes, are used in 
ENL classes to improve reading and vocabulary and give students an understanding of the literary elements they must know 
for the ELA Regents.  Content areas are taught with ENLs alongside non-ENLs as they study grade-appropriate subjects.    
 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66 

 

 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
As part of an educational campus, our teachers engage in inter visitations across the curriculum to identify strategies to 
support our ENLs.  Materials used to help students develop their skills include videos that teachers download from the Internet 
(news, story summaries) and displayed on Smart Boards.  Teachers also use guided note-taking graphic organizers and have 
students do dictation.  In addition, we utilize word walls with pictures and Spanish translations.  We have four laptop carts that 
we employ for many of our programs and projects.  Curriculum planning and mapping custom-designed to meet out students' 
needs are done through the website Rubicon Atlas 
(http://cfn406.rubiconatlas.org/c/pi/v.php/Atlas/Authentication/View/Login).  Written materials in content areas, such as 
readings and assignments, are translated into Spanish for those who require it.   
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We have an orientation program for all new students to the school.  Prior to the beginning of the academic school year, 
parents of ENLs are contacted via telephone calls and automated messenger services to invite families to our school's 
Freshmen Orientation.  In addition, during the school year, families are invited to an OPEN SCHOOL session where they meet 
the principal, guidance counselors, administrators, teachers, support staff including deans, community based organizations 
and campus safety officers.  Our school's Parent Coordinator, Ms. Sarita Borrero, who is fluent in Spanish both orally and via 
writing, reaches out to parents and maintains a school website and bulletin board in both Spanish and English to keep families 
aware and involved.  The school's SLT and Parent Association members are populated by families of ENLs and an interpreter is 
always available to support students' and their families' English language acquisition. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish, Italian, Korean and French are currently offered.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Every Monday we meet as a whole staff for one hour and fifteen minutes and have professional development.  The plan for 
this year so far and moving forward is as follows: In August we learned about the vision of the school, classroom expectations, 
the important components of School Wide goals and initiatives, the three A's and C's (College/Career, Commitment and 
Confidence) and through team building activities we learned to work together in a variety of ways. In September we received 
PD on having difficult conversations with staff members to make our team meetings more effective, we worked on baseline 
assessments within teams for our students, and we discussed discipline data and concerns. We also received PD on the quality 
review. Our ELA department head provides a monthly PD all around literacy. In October we discussed CEP goals, we received 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67 

 

professional development on strategies to implement with our English Language Learners  and how they connected to the 
common core standards from our ELL network specialist, worked on curriculum maps and will discuss discipline by reviewing 
the data and creating next steps.  In November we will receive professional development from  Columbia University (Teacher's 
College) on applying rubrics.  We also learn how to use protocols to look at student work as well as look at assessment data to 
create next steps in Literacy.  In December we will be looking at student work focusing on our English Language Learners and 
will look at more discipline data while we reflect on classroom management strategies. Besides the professional development 
mentioned above, our bilingual guidance counselor addresses the psychosocial needs of the students, providing sessions that 
are mandated and that arise situationally.  She also does group guidance with 9th and 10th grade classes.  All students in 
grades 9 and 11 receive support from their BIG mentors, that consist of important components necessary to the adjustment to 
high school.  For example, graduation requirements, Chancellor's code of discipline, note-taking skills through Cornell notes, 
how to organize your passport portfolio, who is who at our school so they know who to go to with an issue or particular 
support in a certain area,   goal setting and conflict resolution.  Many students take the AVID elective, which provides support 
in how to be a successful high school student.  We will be collaborating with Bronx International, a school within our campus, 
on providing PD to our teachers, specifically about scaffolding in classroom to build reading and writing skills.  
 
Our school's newly development Literacy Plan has been created to address increased language skills across the curriculum in 
the areas of reading, writing, listening and speaking for all students, including our school's ENLs.  We are seeing progress 
across the curriculum in this area and meet with our teachers to review data and modify our curriculum and needed based on 
that data.  Our staff professional development focuses on increased literacy skills for every student and as a result, 
modification are made to both curriculum and PD based on students' needs. 
 
Staff attendance is taken and attendance records are maintained.  In addition, Agenda binders are maintained and kept on 
site, as well.  
  
Our ENL coordinator can attend any to all ENL PD's both on site and off site.The network provides some of this PD throughout 
the school year. Our monthly literacy PD supports all teachers that instruct ENL students, especially since the data is clear on 
where the weaknesses exist with our ENL students. 
  
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
  
Our bilingual guidance counselor addresses the psychosocial needs of the students, providing sessions that are mandated and 
that arise situationally.  She also does group guidance will 9th and 10th grade classes.  All 9th graders receive freshman 
seminar that consist of important components necessary to the adjustment to high school.  For example, graduation 
requirements, Chancellor's code of discipline, note-taking skills through Cornell notes, how to organize your binder, who is 
who at our school so they know who to go to with an issue or particular support in a certain area,   goal setting and conflict 
resolution.  Many students take the AVID elective, which provides support in how to be a successful high school 
student.  Additionally, we provide professional development to support staff and teachers on the new ENL regulations and 
effective ENL programming. 
  
We provide ELL training to all staff.  In December we will offer two hours with our staff on looking at student work for our 
ELL  students. In January during Regents week we will use half a day (3 hours) to focus on topics such as strategic grouping, 
assessment for learning, and academic vocabulary (tier two words). In March during our spring retreat with our staff we will 
spend ninety minutes on professional development regarding the different levels of English Language Learners and their path 
from the LAB-R to the NYSELAT. The different sections of the assessment from the reading and the writing to the listening and

the speaking to the beginner, intermediate, advanced and proficient levels so they are aware. Data will be used so they can see 
the connection to their students since most teach English Language Learners. The last hour will be conducted in June where a 
reflection will occur with our teachers in regards to their curriculum, efforts and supports to our ELL students.  
A record of attendance is kept of these meetings using a sign-in sheet. 
  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parents and families of students in HSVD are invited, encouraged, and expected to attend and engage in parent teacher 
meetings, counseling meetings, SLT and PA meetings, Open House and Open School events throughout the school 
year.  Letters are sent to parents along with voice to voice and automated phone calls to request their attendance and 
participation in meetings to address their respective child's needs.  When needed and when requested, an interpreter is 
always present at meetings to support the successful outcome for each meeting and each event. During PA and SLT meetings, 
parents are given an in depth overview to help their understanding of our school's programs to support our ENL 
students.  When mailings are sent to the homes, these mailings are printed in both English dn Spanish.  provided with 
opportunities to participate in Parents Association, the School Leadership Team, and parents educational activities that relate 
to building strong home/school partnerships, workshops which promote an understanding of performance standards and the 
new promotional criteria, the parent volunteer program, and accessing the services of community resources.  
  
To encourage parent involvement at HSVD we: conduct yearly Parent’s Association elections for Executive Board members; We 
conduct monthly Parent’s Association meetings; through the School Leadership Team develop a plan for increasing teacher’s 
ability to effectively involve parents in their children’s education; hold orientation meetings during the summer and fall to 
present the overall goals of our school, as well as specific grade/class goals; conduct outreach activities and training parents; 
distribute all notices in English and Spanish; provide resources for family outreach to assist and inform parents, and involve 
them in the school community; encourage parents to network with each other and to communicate with school staff; maintain 
a school bulletin board to provide parents with information related to parent meeting/event and to their children’s education 
programs; meetings are scheduled at various times during and after the school day to accommodate parents; bilingual parent 
newsletter; annual open house; activities open to parents, such as the annual picnic, senior breakfast, Project I.A.M. 
performances and Second Cup of Coffee. 
  
Parent contact will be made through monthly calendars, letters and phone calls (by staff and school messenger) to inform of 
school’s instructional programs and performance standards, student assessments and summer programs.  Parents can also 
keep up with their children by utilizing the new Skedula website. All written materials are translated into Spanish by bilingual 
staff members; these staff members also provide oral translations when required. 
 
Whenever meetings are held with parents, an attendance sheet is created, signed and filed.  in addition, notes are taken 
during the meeting including next steps for the school and for the family as needed.  Follow up is made with the family by the 
school staff in attendance at the meeting.  Parents have access to the Principal and school administrators via email address, 
school phone numbers, and cell phone numbers.  Calls are returned to families in a timely manner to address concerns. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents of ENLs are invited and expected to engage in all activities concerning their child at HSVD.  Our Parent Coordinator's 
office is located immediately to the right of the elevator as parents and family members enter our school and counselors, 
teachers, administrators and staff are available to meet with them.  Constant outreach is maintained to request parental 
involvement as part of the school's SLT and PA associations and parents are encouraged to share their concerns, contributions, 
gifts and talents to support their child's involvement in all school activities.  Our Parent Coordinator, Sarita Borrero, sends all 
correspondence regarding school events and meetings to homes in both English and Spanish.  She also sends phone messages

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Franklin Sim, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

If there is more than one LAC, list all. 
 

First Name  

Last Name

Language Access 

Coordinator? Yes/No  

 

(*Primary) 

 

   

 
* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The HLIS indicates in detail the language(s) that are spoken at home and that are used with various family 
members, specific to the four modalities of language (listening, speaking, reading and writing). It also asks parents 
these questions:
