Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Our school mission is to establish a culture of leadership in which students will be empowered to make a difference in 
the world. We are a dedicated team of educators who together strive to create a nurturing and supportive 
environment which ensures that each child reaches his or her potential. Our staff members are dedicated to growing 
as professionals through reflection and collaboration with each other, students, and parents. We will instill in each 
student a passion for learning and character to succeed in college and/or career. We will identify, develop and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

promote successful strategies that meet the educational, social, and emotional needs of each student. We will 
empower our students to be active learners, critical thinkers, and problem solvers. Our teachers, parents, and 
community members work together to provide a safe, supportive environment and a caring school community which 
values diversity. Our students will develop a strong sense of responsibility for themselves, each other, and the 
community. They will attribute success to hard work and persistence which will make them our leaders of tomorrow. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 16 Leonard Dunkly is located in a diverse community in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. We are a Title I 
school serving students from Pre-K to Fifth grade.  

We are a Leader In Me school and are dedicated to cultivating a culture of leadership. We teach our students the 
habits of leadership skills needed to take charge of their learning and become leaders. Teachers are all trained in the 
Leader In Me program as well, therefore students’ leadership skills are then transferred into the classroom 
curriculum. Through class discussions and research, students are able to display their leadership abilities by having 
conversations with partners and in groups about topics or text they have learned. 

We offer many student programs that meet all the needs of students; academic, social, and emotional. Our students 
are well-rounded and versed in the arts. We have a peer mediator and mentor group, Monthly Awards Assemblies, 
Student Leader of the Month, Principal’s Prize, and the Super Kids Program. In addition, our students have 
opportunities to be a part of many exciting extracurricular programs such as a basketball team, clarinet and violin 
training, a chess team, a cheerleading team, Art Club, Lego Club and Debate Team where we partner with MS 50.  

Our supportive environment begins with our open-door policy here at PS 16. Parents are invited to volunteer and 
participate in their child’s daily educational programs. They are able to sit in on classes, meet with teachers to discuss 
student progress, and attend class trips and events. Every Tuesday, we hold parent-teacher conferences, a time when 
parents are able to communicate with their child’s teacher about specific strengths and areas in need of 
improvement. We offer many monthly parent workshops, such as Cook Shop for Families that allows parents to come 
together to learn recipes for healthful eating choices. We also have an active Parent Teacher Association that provides 
support to all parents and serves as a strong liaison between the school and parent networks. We have a parent 
library located in the parent coordinator’s room that includes books in both English and Spanish. All parent workshops 
are translated and made accessible to all of our parents and guardians. 

In addition to all of the above, we celebrate our students, teachers, parents and families through many events, 
including, but not limited to, Family Night, Dance Festival, Holiday Shows, and monthly Awards Assemblies and our 
deep dedication to numerous service projects. Teachers and parents are able to collaborate through the planning and 
preparation of these events. Many of our events occur annually and have become part of our school tradition which 
the entire school community looks forward to attending. The programs and events that parents are able to partake in 
and attend strengthen our family-community ties and positively impact students’ educational experiences.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have seen a significant increase in the number of students with IEPs this year. Out School-Based Support and RTI 
teams are working tirelessly to provide these students with appropriate and least-restrictive services and 
environments. Our recently hired ENL teacher is fluent in three languages (English, Spanish, Chinese) -- all of which 
are beneficial to our specific student population.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Here at P.S. 16 we have a true professional learning community in which leaders, teachers, and parents all value 
education and work together to help children succeed. All of our students are held to high expectations. All of our 
teachers are highly qualified, well-versed in the Common Core Learning Standards and Danielson’s Framework.  

Our curriculum is completely aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and rigorous instruction is evidenced 
by the level of questioning and use of academic vocabulary during classroom instruction. Our school reflects the 
Framework for Great Schools, beginning with trust which is at the forefront of our school culture. From leadership, to 
teachers, to students, there is an understanding that we are all working together toward a common goal: student 
achievement.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
We have made significant strides in improving the level of thinking in the classroom and in making our classrooms 
student-centered instead of teacher-centered. Our Instructional Focus at PS 16 is to provide rigorous instruction in 
Math across all grades. We are striving to have 85% of our 3rd - 5th graders meet the New York State Standards on 
Math tests. Based on the 2018 New York State Math cut scores, 78% of our current students meet the standard. We 
have designed a school-wide focused schedule with a built-in intervention block. This initiative will increase the 
quality of instruction. We have focused heavily on the Collaborative Teachers element of the Framework For Great 
Schools by scheduling 3-5 common preparation periods for each teacher; this allows teachers to have at least one 
inquiry period centered on mathematics. Teachers use collaborative protocols to examine student work and to create 
effective instruction based on the data. Teachers will collaborate consistently to ensure that Math intervention 
lessons include data-driven instruction aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and address student 
achievement needs.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 85% of students in grades 3-5 will meet promotional standards in math based on the number of students 
taking the New York State math test.

Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Members of the school community work together to meet the social and emotional needs of our students and to 
foster a sense of community across the school and within each classroom. As a result, we have a safe and orderly 
school environment with relationships built on mutual trust and assisting one another in behavioral and emotional 
escalations. Based on the 2017-18 School Quality Guide survey, our school is doing well in teaching students the skills 
they need to regulate their behavior and recognize disruptive behavior as social-emotional learning opportunities. 
Based on the Leader in Me survey, our students would like to develop more self-confidence and increase their self-
esteem. In addition, the school survey shows that we could improve in the area of discipline so that it is applied fairly 
to students. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 90% of all our students will demonstrate an awareness of cultural issues, human dignity and student 
diversity as measured by a drop in OORS reports.

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our 2017-2018 Instructional Focus aimed to use reciprocal teaching in mathematics. We made gains in this area by 
focusing professional learning on reciprocal teaching in mathematics. We taught our students how to work together 
in structured groups with teachers as facilitators. From component 1.2 of the 2018 PPO, pedagogy and rigorous 
instruction, reciprocal teaching, was an area of celebration in the rooms that use it. In 2017-18, teachers received 
professional development on text coding; this was a strategy that really worked to improve student understanding of 
pertinent and irrelevant information in reading passages. For the 2018-19 school year, we will incorporate text coding 
in all subject areas. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 75% of all student assessments will show evidence of text coding.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the 2018 PPO, our areas of celebration are 1.3 - Test Prep and 1.4 - Working with parents. A 
recommendation from the 2018 PPO was to utilize Engage NY more effectively to drive instruction. However, Engage 
NY resources are no longer compatible to GoMath and Wonders Curriculum. There is a district-wide initiative to 
educate schools on culturally responsive teaching.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, all staff members will be actively engaged in Inquiry work and data collection as measured by Inquiry data 
collection sheets.

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Staff members are recruited within the needed license area and teachers are expected to teach a demo lesson to 
demonstrate their pedagogical practice. For retention, we give teachers a voice (with surveys, etc.) and leadership 
opportunities. New teachers are given a mentor that meets with them weekly to provide support. All teachers are 
encouraged to attend district and city-wide professional development to continue to grow in their practice. Teaching 
assignments are based on preference sheets and teacher strengths. Our professional learning opportunities are based 
on observations and teachers' needs with consistent teacher input. All staff members who attend professional 
development workshops are expected to turn-key information to relevant staff members.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Based on teachers' needs or requests, professional development is sought out from the Brooklyn North Field Support 
Center, the district, and experts in the field. Our paraprofessionals were trained in how to assess students with 
running records. All staff members who attend workshops are provided with the time to present information to their 
colleagues. All paraprofessionals and out of classroom staff are involved in all professional development provided. 
Professional development is often differentiated based on grade levels and teachers' needs. Paraprofessionals attend 
break-out groups based on the children they are working with throughout the year. The principal and assistant 
principal attend monthly meetings provided by the district office. School leaders attend professional development.

We hold consistent open houses for families of preschool children so they can see what the school has to offer. We 
reach out to local daycares and centers. We believe that early intervention is truly important. We utilize the Work 
Sampling System (WSS) for authentic assessment of our pre-Kindergarten students. Parents come in on Friday to 
assist with toys and games. Parents also help with breakfast and lunches. From January on, Pre-K and Kindergarten 
perform in school-wide shows and performances. This provides parents with the expectations of Kindergarten. Family 
meetings are organized in order to ask questions about the transition to Kindergarten. Students' academic and 
emotional needs will be constantly observed and assessed so interventions can be provided as necessary. The Pupil 
Personnel Team will address the needs of Kindergarten students, AIS services, and support services for all 
Kindergarten students. Hearing, vision, and dental screenings will also occur, as well as, testing for fine and gross 
motor development. We will provide information about the PTA and the parent coordinator will serve as a link 
between the parents and the school. We will also hold parent workshops.  

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teachers provide input into which assessments they want to use. We meet in grade meetings regularly during which 
teachers look at possible assessments to use and decide which ones to use, and then examine student work using 
norming protocols, and compare findings for future decision-making and planning. Teachers have been exposed to a 
Go Math professional development where they learned how to give online assessments. These assessments are 
broken down by standard and provide teachers with an item analysis that they utilize to drive their instruction. 
Students use Mathletics, an online math program. Teachers can use Mathletics to assign specific assessments. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

2018-19 Parent Involvement Policy and Parent-School Compact for PS 16  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Section I: Title I Parent Involvement Policy  

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Therefore, P.S. 16 Leonard Dunkly, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title 
I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent-Teacher Association, and Title I Parent Advisory Council as trained volunteers and welcomed members 
of the school community. 

 

PS 16’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities.  

In developing the PS 16’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parent members of the school’s Parent-Teacher 
Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent 
Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and improve parent 
involvement and school quality, PS 16 will:  

● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
There are a number of formative assessments and curriculum-embedded assessments being used to guide instructional 
planning for our ELLs; these include Fountas and Pinnell running records, Wonders reading curriculum unit assessments and 
teacher-created assessments. The Fountas and Pinnell running records help to determine each student's reading level and 
allows both the teacher and student to develop specific reading goals throughout the school year. It also informs teachers of 
the types of questions students' struggle with (e.g., literal, inferential). The Wonders reading curriculum unit assessments are 
used to assess a variety of literacy skills, such as, phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary and reading comprehension. In 
addition, teacher-created assessments are used throughout the year to assess students' letter identification skills, phonics 
skills, decoding skills, Dolch sight word knowledge and writing skills. Instruction is driven by the data collected from these 
assessments and data is then used to decide specific skills that must be taught. The data shows that ELLs who make gains in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

their running record reading levels also make gains in the Reading portion of the NYSESLAT because the running records assess 
their reading accuracy and comprehension. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

To support this effort, paraprofessionals assist teachers in conducting the running records four times a year for students (i.e., 
once in the beginning of the school year, twice mid-year, and once at the end of the school year). Teachers administer the 
Wonders curriculum-embedded assessments at the end of each unit (i.e., every 4 to 6 weeks). Also, Kindergarten to second 
grade teachers and the English as a New Language teacher (E.N.L.) also create their own assessments to assess early literacy 
skills. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
ELA benchmark assessments and ELL periodic assessments are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need. The 
ELA benchmark assessments are administered once in the fall and once in the spring to students who are not first year ELLs in 
grades 3 to 5. The ELL periodic assessments are administered once in the fall and once in the spring to ELLs in grades 3 to 5.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The 3 to 5 classroom teachers and the E.N.L. teacher meet to discuss students’ progress and areas of need once the 
summative data has been gathered. Assessment results are used to create intervention groups and adjust student groups 
based on the skills and strategies students must work on.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our school uses data (e.g., formative and summative assessment data, years of service, English and home language literacy, 
SIFE status) to guide instruction for ELLs within the RTI framework by providing responsive and rigorous instruction through a 
tiered system of instructional support. There are three tiers of instruction and intervention support. Tier 1 is the core of 
instruction that uses a rigorous and research-based curriculum that includes differentiation and methodologies for ELLs to 
meet their language development needs. Teachers use formative and summative assessments to guide daily instruction and to 
monitor ELLs’ progress throughout the year. If students are not showing sufficient progress or performing below-benchmark 
and need more targeted and intensive academic support, then they move into Tier 2 intervention or Tier 3 intensive 
intervention where specific students are placed in small groups or receive individualized instruction within or outside of the 
classroom to focus on their specific language and content area needs. Instruction is tailored specifically to meet their needs as 
language learners. RtI provides a systematic process for examining ELLs' backgrounds, educational history, native language 
proficiency, socioeconomic status and culture in order to understand how these impact academic achievement and use this 
knowledge in the lesson planning process. Ongoing data is used to adjust instruction and intervention for ELLs; Tier 2 and Tier 
3 supports are removed when ELLs have shown significant progress.     
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The NYSESLAT and the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) are used to evaluate and inform our ELL programs by determining how 
many students are making progress by advancing a proficiency level or improving their scale score. NYSESLAT individual 
student reports display students’ strengths and weaknesses according to each modality. By using the results of the EDAT and 
the RLAT from ATS, we are able to see how students performed on each  modality, their at-risk levels and the number of 
proficiency levels they advanced or regressed by. We are then able to determine the type and amount of ELL services each 
student will need based on their proficiency levels and the modalities we need to focus on for each student; our ELLs quickly 
become proficient in Listening and Speaking (social language-BICS) and are making steady progress in Reading, but they are 
making minimal progress in Writing. Therefore, the data shows that instruction should focus on Reading and Writing in order 
to push students to overall proficiency. Their at-risk levels and whether or not they advanced or regressed will also inform 
teachers about any additional supports the student(s) will need. Students may be put into smaller groups and receive push-in 
services in addition to pull-out services in order to provide more guided instruction in areas of need and to help them excel in 
all four modalities. In addition, ELA and math data are analyzed to determine how many students met grade level standards. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

 

We also calculate AMAO in order to note scale score increases and look at the number of students who advance a proficiency 
level. Our school continues to meet AMAO I and II, which shows that students continue to significantly show progess as well as 
attain proficiency on the NYSESLAT. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 
In the beginning of the school year, the ENL teacher disseminates NYSESLAT data to the staff and explains the scores, 
proficiency levels and needs so that she could create an ELL program for the ELLs with input from the staff. The administration 
disseminates ELA and math test scores so that teachers can target those students that need additional support and work with 
the ENL teacher to meet those needs. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students are grouped based on grade bands and/or proficiency on the NYSITELL/NYSESLAT. In the freestanding ENL 
program, instruction for ELLs is delivered through a combination of standalone ENL and integrated ENL depending on 
the students' proficiency levels. As per CR Part 154.2, ELLs in grades K-8 that are at the Entering and Emerging levels 
of English proficiency must receive at least 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week; Entering ELLs must receive equal 
minutes (i.e., 180 minutes) of Stand-Alone ENL and Integrated ENL in ELA, whereas, Emerging ELLs must receive 90 
minutes of Stand-Alone ENL and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA, but have the option of choosing either Stand-
Alone ENL or Integrated ENL in any content area for the remaining 90 minutes of ENL instruction. ELLs in grades K-8 
that are at the Transitioning and Expanding levels of English proficiency must receive at least 180 minutes of ENL 
instruction. Transitioning ELLs must receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL in ELA, but have the flexibility of choosing 
Stand-Alone ENL or Integrated ENL in a content area for the other 90 minutes of ENL instruction. Expanding ELLs only 
receive Integrated ENL, but it can be in ELA or another content area. Lastly, Commanding ELLs receive ENL services for 
an additional two years; the 90 minutes of ENL instruction they receive must be integrated ENL, but it can be in ELA or 
another content area. Students are grouped heterogeneously (i.e., mixed proficiency levels) by grade and are usually 
placed in the same class for ease of integrated ENL instruction. Depending on the group size and the students' English 
proficiency levels, students from multiple grades with no more than 2 grade spans between them may be grouped 
together for Stand-Alone ENL instruction.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Explicit ENL and ELA minutes are delivered in the freestanding ENL model through a combination of standalone ENL instruction 
that focuses on English language skills that will support students in the content area classes and integrated ENL instruction 
that consists of co-planning and co-teaching by the classroom content area teachers and the ESL teacher. For the 2017-2018 
school year, we currently have 16 ELLs in K-5 grades at our school; they range from the Entering to Commanding levels and 
depending on their language proficiency level, they receive anywhere from 90 minutes to 360 minutes of ENL instruction per 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

week. At PS 16, ELLs receive 600 minutes of ELA instruction per week through the Wonders curriculum and two periods of 
Math everyday through the Go Math! program; the Wonders and Go Math! programs have ENL specific components which 
help the ENL teacher align the ENL and general education class curricula. All English Language Learners (ELLs) are instructed in 
English using Total Physical Response, Cooperative Learning and the Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach. In the 
ENL classroom, co-planning and co-teaching occurs between the classroom teachers and the ENL teacher in order to provide 
integrated ENL instruction in the various content areas to help ELLs acccess the content while developing their language skills. 
Many different practices are utilized for ENL instruction; they include scaffolding, modeling, bridging, schema building, 
contextualization, text representation and metacognition. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Core content is generally delivered by the classroom teachers, whom have been provided with professional development on 
the use of strategies that help make content comprehensible for ELLs. All classroom teachers follow the Common 
Core  Learning Standards and understand that academic content language is taught along with English language development. 
It is also delivered in the Freestanding ENL model through integrated ENL instruction whereby the classroom content area 
teachers and the ENL teacher meet weekly to co-plan instruction to include content area and language objectives so that they 
can make the content comprehensible for ELLs and co-teach the content while targeting specific language skills. Some 
strategies that are utilized include scaffolding, Total Physical Response (TPR), schema building, contextualization, text 
representation, bridging, modeling, and metacognition. All ELLs are instructed in English, but bilingual dictionaries, glossaries, 
peers, native language books and websites are also utilized to support the home language. The ENL teacher may support the 
classroom teacher in content area instruction by reinforcing the content area lessons in the standalone ENL 
sessions.  Advanced students receive additional content area instruction from the ENL teacher through literacy, such as the 
reading and writing of social studies and science topics.  By explicitly combining language and content objectives in everyday 
teaching, both in the general and ENL classroom, ELLs will be prepared to meet high academic Common Core Learning 
Standards. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Students who are identified as ELLs as indicated by their NYSITELL results and have a home language of Spanish are evaluated 
in their native language using the Spanish LAB upon enrollment.  This assessment is used to tell proficiency of the student’s 
native language, which helps when planning instruction. Throughout the year, we ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated 
in their home language by providing them with testing accommodations, such as, bilingual dictionaries and glossaries and 
alternate language versions of exams and/or translators. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. SIFE: Students are invited to attend the following intervention programs: after school and Saturday Academy. Students meet 
with the ENL teacher for 360 minutes per week and receive academic intervention services (AIS). Sometimes students are 
placed in a lower grade. Students are grouped based on proficiency and grade level. Additional resources such as high 
interest/low level books, native language and/or bilingual books are given to the students to support and supplement their 
class books. 
b. Newcomer ELLs: Students are invited to attend the following intervention programs: after school and Saturday Academy. 
Students meet with the ENL teacher according to the mandated number of minutes depending on their level of proficiency. 
The ENL teacher utilizes many visuals, hands-on activities and web-based programs (e.g., Starfall) to teach basic literacy and 
conversational skills. Additional resources such as high interest/low level books, bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, bilingual 
stories, bilingual peers, native language books, and books on tape are given to the students to supplement their class 
materials.  These students are often placed in classes where the classroom teacher is bilingual, which provides native language

support. 
c. Developing ELLs: Students will be invited to attend the following intervention programs: after school and Saturday Academy. 
Students meet with the ENL teacher according to the mandated number of minutes depending on their level of proficiency. 
Special focus will be placed on preparation for the NYSESLAT as well as the ELA and content area exams. Specifically, teachers 
provide whole-class and small-group instruction focusing on reading comprehension strategies, writing skills and tier II and tier 
III vocabulary. The ENL teacher will use data from a variety of sources (ARIS, Scantron, Predictive tests, teacher-created 
assessments) to determine specific areas of weakness to target in order to help students attain proficiency. 
d. Long Term ELLs: P.S. 16 currently does not have any Long Term ELLs. However, they would also be invited to attend the 
following intervention programs: after school and Saturday Academy. Students would meet with the ENL teacher according to 
the mandated number of minutes depending on their level of proficiency. Special focus would be on preparation for the 
NYSESLAT as well as the ELA and content area exams. Specifically, teachers would provide whole-class and small-group 
instruction focusing on reading comprehension strategies, writing skills and tier II and tier III vocabulary. The ENL teacher 
would use data from a variety of sources (ARIS, Scantron, Predictive tests, teacher-created assessments) to determine specific 
areas of weakness to target in order to help students attain proficiency. 
e. Former ELLs:  Students who have achieved proficiency on the NYSESLAT are carefully monitored to ensure their continued 
success.  They also have the opportunity to attend the after school program and Saturday Academy offered to the general 
population of students. Since they are English commanding, P.S. 16 focuses more on developing their reading and writing skills 
in the content areas by designing integrated content and language lessons that target specific vocabulary and language 
functions and structures. They also receive testing modifications for two years. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Some of the grade-level materials and instructional strategies teachers use to teach ELL-SWDs are: pictures or photographs 
that go with new grade-level vocabulary, picture dictionaries or glossaries, thesauri, realia, scaffolding, Total Physical Response 
(TPR), schema-building, contextualization, bridging, modeling, and metacognition. Teachers also use hands-on activities and 
technology (e.g., iPads, Promethean, computer software, SMART Board) to ensure the students’ understanding of content area 
subjects while acquiring English. The ENL teacher and classroom teacher provide support services as per their IEP and RTI 
services and modify lessons for students with special needs to address different learning styles.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELL-SWDs receive ENL services along with the general education ELL population. IEPs are used to help determine classroom 
grouping and seating arrangements.  IEP goals guide differentiated instruction in the ENL classroom and lesson/unit objectives 
are based on their goals. Instruction is based on grade level standards, individual student goals (IEP goals for ELL-SWD) and 
level of proficiency for all ELL students, including ELL-SWDs. The ENL curriculum focuses on the needs of all ELL students and 
also includes accommodations that can be used for ELL-SWDs to ensure that their needs are met within the least restrictive 
environment. Moreover, the ENL teacher meets with classroom teachers weekly to co-plan and modify instruction for ELL-
SWDs. Scheduling flexibility allows all ELL-SWDs to attend their special classes such as art, gym, music, and computers and 
allows their participation in all programs available in the school, in addition to receiving the mandated ESL services. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
For SIFE, newcomer ELLs, developing ELLs and Long Term ELLs, the following interventions will be offered for ELA, Math, 
Science and Social Studies: after school program for 2 hours twice a week (e.g., Wednesday and Thursday), Saturday Academy 
for 3 hours per session and Academic Intervention Services several times a week depending on students' individual needs. 
Cluster teachers serve as academic intervention specialists to help classroom teachers and students in all areas that need 
improvement. Long term ELLs, SIFE and newcomers are particularly encouraged to attend these programs. Intervention 
services will be offered in English, but native language support is available as needed. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

For the upcoming school year, the ENL teacher is integrating language instruction with the Wonders curriculum, the GoMath! 
program, the Science Fusion curriculum and the Social Studies Passport curricula. She will be co-planning and co-teaching with 
various classroom teachers to deliver ENL instruction within the content areas.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs receive the same opportunities as the general population of students. They are invited and encouraged to attend all 
school programs and supplemental services. As per Jose P. all teachers are trained in ENL methodologies in order to include 
and accommodate for ELL students. After school and Saturday Academy programs are offered to all ELLs to provide support 
and language development in all content areas. Letters inviting students to attend programs are always sent home in the 
parents' preferred language. Supplemental programs such as chess and art are offered to all students, including ELLs.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional materials that are used to support ELLs include:  
ELA: leveled books, ELL support workbooks and teacher's guides in the Wonders curriculum, picture dictionaries, bilingual 
glossaries, thesauri, laptops, overhead projector, and listening center 
Math/Science/Social Studies: native language text books and workbooks, bilingual dictionaries, bilingual glossaries 
ENL: listening center, games, picture cards, realia, computer programs, internet sources (e.g., Starfall, BrainPOP ESL), iPad 
applications, Carousel of Ideas language program, NYSESLAT test prep books 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

We do not have a TBE or Dual Language program at our school. Our ENL program is delivered in English with native language 
support provided to newcomers and/or beginner level ENL students, as well as, any students who may still need the support. 
When appropriate, native language support is offered in the following ways: bilingual/native language books, one-on-one 
support from a bilingual teacher, text books in the native language, glossaries and picture dictionaries and access to computers 
and iPads for use in translation. In addition, students are encouraged to speak and read in their native language at home in 
addition to English.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

For support services and programs, students are grouped according to age, ability, and proficiency. A range of materials are 
available to ELLs from grades K-5 including, but not limited to: leveled books, educational games, scaffolded text, bilingual 
textbooks and workbooks and internet programs. Differentiation is used to ensure that resources correspond to ELLs ages and 
grade levels. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Resources that are used to support ELLs are inside the ENL teacher's room, as well as, classroom teachers' and guidance 
counselors' rooms. Resources are shared and staff members meet weekly in order to discuss and meet the academic, linguistic 
and socioemotional needs of ELLs. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ELLs are welcomed to the school community by a bilingual speaking staff member. They are given an 
orientation including a tour of the school, a back to school supply list, and families are introduced to the parent coordinator 
and ENL. teacher.  In addition, all newly enrolled ELLs, including ELLs who enroll throughout the school year, are able to 
participate in all after school and Saturday school programs.  They are also invited to join any extracurricular activities and 
clubs available at our school. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

 

 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

There are currently no language elective courses offered at the school.      
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A-  No Dual Language program currently at our school.   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The ENL teacher will attend monthly district ELL liaison meetings, Office of ELLs' (OELL) professional developments, technical 
support sessions (e.g., LAP, BESIS, NYSESLAT) and other professional development workshops focused on ELL regulations, the 
Common Core Learning Standards and best practices. For classroom teachers of ELLs, opportunities will be provided to attend 
professional development through the OELL. Additionally,  the ENL teacher will provide in-house training/professional 
development to the assistant principal, the secretary, and all teachers regarding ENL methodologies and strategies for 
supporting ELLs in the general education classroom and within the school, beginning from the registration process and 
continuing as they receive services. Workshops for staff in all content areas occur on Monday afternoons from 2:35 to 3:55, 
Election Day and Chancellor’s Conference Day. Staffs also register and attend professional developments offered outside of the 
school throughout the school year. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our school meets the professional development requirements as per CR PART 154.2: 15% of total hours for all teachers by 
providing ELL-specific professional development throughout the school year; they are conducted by either Ms. Cheng, the ENL 
teacher, or ENL consultants. Our school meets the professional development requirements as per CR PART 154:2: 50% of total 
hours for ENL teachers by informing the ENL teacher of workshops offered by the OELL. The teachers are also informed about 
the professional development workshops and trainings provided by the OELL and are encouraged to attend. Records are kept 
for professional development activities by keeping the meetings' agendas and attendance sheets.   
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The school provides annual individual meetings, not including mandated parent orientation meetings and DOE scheduled 
parent-teacher conferences, with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development progress, language 
proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas by meeting with parents on Tuesday

mornings during parent engagement time. Ms. Cheng, the ENL teacher, helps provide language translations for Spanish and 
Chinese. For all other languages, the translation and interpretation unit are called as needed.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parents (including parents of ELLs) are invited and encouraged to be involved in the school community. Some of the programs 
include awards assemblies, holiday shows, science fair, parent breakfasts, family night and other celebrations throughout the 
year.  Parents are welcomed into the classroom to participate in author celebrations and to attend field trips. They can also 
volunteer to assist in various activities. All parents are encouraged to participate in the PTA. Additionally, the school provides 
programs for parents of ELLs some of which include weekend family field trips, ELL parent breakfasts and ELL parent 
workshops. The parent coordinator, Ms. Cortes, conducts workshops and sends out invitations in the parents' preferred 
language of communication so that they can also participate in PTA events and learn how to support their children better at 
home. She is the liasion between the parents, principal and the teachers. She also works closely with the PTA to organize 
meetings. She attends Community Education Council (CEC) meetings to help resolve community issues. Ms. Cortes, the parent 
coordinator, is able to translate for parents that speak Spanish. For Chinese, she asks for support from Ms. Cheng, the ENL 
teacher. For all other languages, the Translation and Interpretation Unit is contacted.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Mary Renny, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

All parents/guardians of newly enrolled students fill out a Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) when 
registering their child. This form is maintained as part of the student’s record. As parents are registering, they are 
informed of all the translation services available: the DOE's Translation and Interpretation Unit, the Over-the-
Phone Interpretation Services, our ESL teacher/Language Access Coordinator and our bilingual (i.e., Spanish and 
English, Chinese and English) staff members. If the parent/guardian indicates on part III of the HLIS that they 
would like to receive information from the school in their home language, forms being sent home are translated 
either in written form or orally to the parent/guardian. Information from teachers is translated to parents by staff 
members who speak the home language (i.e., Spanish or Chinese). Parents' language preferences are indicated on 
the HLIS and Emergency Contact cards, as well as, confirmed orally by a pedagogue who speaks the parents' home 
language. The DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit is utilized if a parent/guardian needs information to be 
translated in a language other than Spanish or Chinese. Parent surveys are distributed in Spanish and English by 
the parent coordinator in order to maintain accurate data on parent language choices. The ATS Report of 
Preferred Languages (RAPL) is updated regularly in order to maintain accurate information on parent language

choices. Emergency Contact Cards are also updated regularly to keep parent language choices current. The ENL 
teacher also maintains a report with parents' preferred languages, by class and grade. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
