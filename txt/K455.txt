Section 2: Executive Summary and Organizing Principles  

 
The Objective 
The intent of this Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) is to continue to frame a three-year process 
for each Renewal school and design a comprehensive plan that outlines a strategic path to a paradigm shift in each 
school at every level. The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that 
meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school 
can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to 
provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including 
all stakeholders.  
 
The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program: 

  A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff, 

community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity. 
We must all be willing learners. 

  A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence. 
  Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school 

community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal 

  Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school 

environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members. 

  Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work. 
  The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over 

the three year period of renewal. 

 
The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy: 

By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align 
instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.  
Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction, 
school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school 
culture. 

 
The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy: 
In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase 
student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve 
teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and 
increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of 
student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning 
and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal 
schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring 
of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a 
Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and 
expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will 
stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school 
ready and able to learn. 
 
School Receivership  
In April 2015, state lawmakers and Governor Andrew Cuomo created section 211-f of the State Education Law, which 
established the School Receivership program as a new intervention strategy to turn around struggling schools. This new 
law, and Commissioner’s regulation 100.19, requires that “Persistently Struggling Schools,” defined as Priority Schools 
that have been in the most severe accountability status since the 2006-07 school year, be given an initial one or two-
year period under a “Superintendent Receiver”.  These schools were placed in receivership under the New York City 

 
 
2018-19 RSCEP-O                                                                                                                                                                                                     5 

 
Schools Chancellor. Each school must make demonstrable improvement on specific benchmarks or it will be placed 
under an independent receiver. Under the Chancellor’s Receivership Plan, the School Renewal Program is NYCDOE’s 
core strategy for turning around struggling schools. Renewal Schools have already begun implementing significant 
interventions and are receiving additional resources and support to accelerate student performance and help close 
achievement gaps reflected in this RSCEP. 
 
Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) 

The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for 
each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools, 
Strong Communities, including the following: 

  Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19 

RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with 
the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All 
Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping 
benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the 
Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by 
definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership 
demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.  

  Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and 

documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the 
desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.  

  Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes 

and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five 
discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an 
action plan. 

  Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental 

health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school. 

  Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool 

 

and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners. 
Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and 
instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding 
to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students. 
  Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement. 

The RSCEP will also enable Renewal Schools that were designated as “Out of Time” Priority Schools during the 2013-14 
school year to respond to additional state-mandated requirements, including: providing students access to Career and 
Technical Education (CTE) program offerings at schools in Good Standing; and, mandatory professional development for 
school leadership and staff. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students.

Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 
 

 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 

 
 
2018-19 RSCEP-O                                                                                                                                                                                                     7 

 

Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 

 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
I.  Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 

Next Steps for RSCEP Development 

The Renewal School Committee, appointed jointly by the DOE and UFT, shall create the School Renewal Plan to be 
implemented for the 2018-19 school year, consistent with applicable law, regulations, and applicable collective 
bargaining agreements and subject to approval by the SED Commissioner. 

  Step 1: Form the School Community Engagement Team consistent with the DOE-UFT agreement regarding the 

development of the School Renewal Plan for Priority Schools identified as “Out of Time” during the 2013-14 
school year. 

  Step 2: Ensure that a fully formed and functional SLT exists in every Renewal school and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 3: In consultation with the SLT, conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American 

Institute of Research (AIR) needs assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current 
quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 4: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.   

  Step 5: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools. 

  Step 6: Revisit the school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs assessment 
and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific, Measurable, 
Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor progress against the 
qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school community know when you 
have reached your goal.   

  Step 7: Consult with the SLT, and build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address 

students’ needs in each action plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to 
improve student achievement. 

  Step 8: Update the school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement 

Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 9: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Community School, Career and Technical Education 

Program (CTE), and Professional Development Plan sections.

  Step 10: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an 

overall cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the 
action plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including your school’s mission statement and a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or 
special initiatives being implemented.  

2.  What are the school’s beliefs about student learning? 
3. 
4.  Describe the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which the school made the most progress over 

Identify any special student populations that the school has and what their specific needs are. 

the past year, and which elements remain most challenging. Be sure to include the historical progress the 
school has made with establishing family and community partner engagement. 

5.  List strong partnerships that currently exist with CBOs and or indicate whether this has been a challenge. 
6.  Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year. 
Boys & Girls High School has an enrollment of 442 students across grades 9-12. The student population is made up of 
82.78 % black students, 10.38% Hispanic, 0.76% American Indian, 1.52% Asian, 0.76% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific 
Islander, 2.03% white and 1.01% multi-racial. 27.85% are Students with Disabilities (SWD), and 6.33% are English 
Language Learners (ELL). Males account for 67.59% or 271 students of the population enrolled and females account 
for 32.41% or 126 students. The overall attendance rate for 2017-2018 was 82%. Graduation rate was 64.7% by June 
2018 and 73% by August 2018. In addition, the 5 year graduation rate is 69.2%. 

 

Mission Statement: 

 

The mission of Boys and Girls High School is to prepare our students to achieve their full potential, make positive 
choices, and have a plan for life after high school. This will be accomplished by teaching our students to think critically 
and conscientiously about themselves, their community and their Global Village. We believe that students achieve 
success and embrace learning when they feel safe and are supported by competent and caring adults. 

 

This school year, based on the findings of the 2018-2019 Quality Review Report and the NYSED Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE), we will continue our effort to strengthen our instructional core (Instruction, 
Pedagogy and Curriculum). BGHS is committed to ensuring that we have engaging, rigorous, and coherent curricula 
across disciplines, including career and technical education (CTE), accessible for a variety of learners and aligned to 
the Common Core Learning Standards and/or content standards. It is through this work that we will develop our 
capacity, as individuals and as a community, to help our students maximize their potential. Our instructional focus for 
the 2018-2019 school year is: 

If we collectively strengthen the cultural conditions in which teachers are supported in purposefully using balanced 
formative assessment data to drive and communicate actionable next steps that continually provides students with 
opportunities to revise their work products, then students will develop the self-efficacy and student ownership skills 
necessary to succeed in rigorous Regents-aligned tasks and engage in ongoing learning experiences in which 
comprehensive literacy strategies are embedded.

Our instructional focus has been strategically designed to enhance student outcomes and recommendations made by 
the Joint SED-DOE Progress Monitoring Visit, NYSED Progress Monitoring visits and 2017-2018 Quality Review: 

1.  Students will regularly engage in rigorous Regents aligned tasks. 
2.  Teachers will use formative assessment data to adjust instruction to meet the needs of all students and 

students are aware of an act on next learning steps. 

3.  Schools will take a comprehensive approach to student literacy. 
4.  Schools will practice collective efficacy and cultural habits to promote student ownership and achievement. 

Students at Boys and Girls High School will have the opportunity to explore varied courses of study and rigorous 
higher level courses, such as College Now courses and Advanced Placement classes in AP English Literature, AP 
Calculus, AP Seminar, AP U.S. History and AP Computer Principles. From completion of the core academic courses, 
electives, and college courses to focused Career and Technical certification programs, students will graduate from our 
school prepared for the world of work and higher learning. 

 

Strengths: 

  Rich academic Sports program 
  Career and Technical Education Program 
  Mentoring program 
  Community Based Organization- Good Shepherd Services 
  Community partnership 

The Career and Technical education for 9th graders will has a strong emphasis on skills acquisition. In addition to the 
round of Career and Technical exploration courses, students will be expected to pass two Regents by the end of the 
9th grade. For students pursuing a Career and Technical certification, 9th and 10th grade will consist of exploration of 
Career and Technical courses. The 11th grade will serve as the year for concentration, and 12th grade will focus on 
requirements for certification. 

Boys and Girls High School provides targeted interventions for students who are on track, off track and approaching 
graduation requirements. This initiative has been instrumental in ensuring that the school maintains a partnership 
between parent and guardians, students, and mentor/ Success Coaches, to support student achievement. Parents and 
guardians will be engaged in the life of the school so that they become active partners in the school community. The 
school has also implemented an Advisory program for students for grades 9- 12. This initiative was developed to 
provide incoming 9th grade students with support as they transition into high school and enhanced efforts around 
college and career readiness for our 12 grade cohort students. Boys and Girls High School is now working to expand 
this program to include all grades beginning in the fall 2018 semester. 

In addition, there will be on-going town hall, grade team, and "Operation Project Graduation" meetings for students 
with the Principal, Guidance Counselors, and Success Coaches before, after and during each marking periods to 
ensure that students remain on track for graduation and/or receives the necessary interventions to support students’ 
academic achievement. There will also be ongoing progress monitoring meetings for students who are struggling and 
discussions about specific needs to be met. Targeted academic intervention programs will be designed for each 
student to support their achievement with the inclusion of administrators, teachers, guidance counselors, 
administrators, Success Coaches and support staff. For additional enrichment, extended learning time including PM 
School, Saturday Academy, Winter Break Academy, Spring Break Academy, Regents Bootcamps and Summer Bridge 
Academy courses will be provided on-site.

Our Community Based Organization, Good Shepherd Services, provides support to students after the regular school 
day concludes. An advisory committee, comprised of elected officials, clergy, local community based organizations 
and business, and institutions of higher learning will continue to offer support, guidance, and oversight to the school 
community. 

 

Strong family and community ties have been enhanced by our continued efforts to make Boys and Girls and Girls High 
School a supportive and nurturing environment. This has been evident through the development of a Parent and 
Community Welcome Center that was established in September 2016. Activities including Curriculum Night, Family 
Day, Project Graduation Parent Meetings, Monthly Athletic Parent Meetings, Award Ceremonies and College and 
Career informational sessions, have increased parental involvement, bringing in parents and guardians to celebrate 
the progress and achievements of their child. Beginning in the fall of 2018, we will be holding a Parent Leadership 
Academy that is designed to provide families with monthly workshop designed to provide families with tools to 
support their child’s academic and social emotional development. 

 

Areas of Need: 

  Greater articulation to ensure that the community at large is aware of the improvements and changes being 

made at Boys and Girls High School. 

 

The school (including the CET (Community Engagement Team), BGHS Community Advisory Board, alumni members, 
students, and key stakeholders will engage in a process of exploring options for "Rebranding, Rebuilding, and 
Recruiting". These efforts will be inclusive of a user friendly website, a more strategic social media presence, and 
creating a more welcoming physical environment (parent and community welcome center, improved signage, and 
Student Center). Boys and Girls High School has developed strategic relationships with middle schools and continues 
to utilize its articulation team to continue outreach to enrollments centers and feeder schools.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Summative Vision, Annual Goals, and Action Plans  

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 3 Statement of Practice  
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
3.2 

The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of 
rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students. 
Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction 
(DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and 
address student achievement needs. 
The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner 
within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the 
arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities. 
Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative 
assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student 
reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 

1.  Summarize your school’s strengths relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs 

selected above. 

2.  Summarize your school’s needs relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs 

selected above. 
Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section. 

3. 
4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

 
3.2- Curricula reviewed by the IIT did provide targeted goals for students with disabilities and English language learners. 
During classroom visits, the IIT noted that teachers did not ensure that at-risk students had access to rigorous and 
coherent curricula. The IIT also noted, in classrooms visited, that there were inconsistencies in the use of instructional 
strategies, including differentiation, multiple points of entry, purposeful student groupings, and meaningful instructional 
feedback with next steps for improvement. Instruction observed did not ensure access to curricula aligned to the CCLS. 
However, the IIT did not observe the consistent use of rigor, student engagement, or differentiation in the classes 
visited. Because curriculum development is at various stages and school leaders have not provided teachers in all grades 
and subjects with sustained, systemic, targeted support, staff have not developed and implemented rigorous and 
coherent curricula reflecting the CCLS across all grades and content. 

 

3.3. Teachers will meet daily to analyze data and make informed decisions about CCLS curriculum as well as, 
collaborate using the Datawise protocol. The teachers will look closely at the IEP data on students to construct IEP-at-
a glance documents that will be used to create multiple entry points into the lesson by content, process or product. 
The teacher’s will obtain support on the implementation of best practices and the use of tiered instruction in the

classroom that will illustrate rigorous tasks aligned to the CCLS and Regents skills. The priority will be meeting 
students where they are and getting students to persevere through rigorous tasks that are in alignment with the CCLS 
and Regents skills. The data sources that were used to analyze were the 2017-2018 Quality Review Report and New 
York State Integrated Intervention Team Report. 

 

3.4-Teachers are scheduled time to work in grade teams with teachers of all subjects particularly with the focus on 
infusing the arts and technology skills into their curriculum. In the teams, the teachers look at student work products 
and create rubrics that reflect the skills needed to succeed in these disciplines. The administrative cabinet will create 
more opportunities for intervisitations and modeling to illustrate the implementation of interdisciplinary practices 
and identifying methods for adjusting instruction based on checks for understanding. The priority need is the ongoing 
check for understanding that was one of the recommendations made during the 2017-2018 Quality Review Report 
and New York State Integrated Intervention Team Report. 

3.5- While the school collects student data, the school does not have a system to ensure that data is used to inform 
instructional decision-making and school improvement efforts. The IIT did not see frequent evidence of scaffolding or 
purposeful student groupings in the classrooms the team visited. In addition, most lessons observed by the IIT were 
delivered to the whole class and had minimal opportunities for differentiation. Without the consistent modification 
of curricular plans and instructional strategies based on student data, the school is limited in its ability to provide 
curriculum that will address the needs of all of its students.

Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction 

What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across 
classrooms?   
If we collectively strengthen the cultural conditions in which teachers are supported in purposefully using balanced 
formative assessment data to drive and communicate actionable next steps that continually provides students with 
opportunities to enhance their work products, then students will develop the self-efficacy and student ownership skills 
necessary to succeed in rigorous Regents-aligned tasks and engage in ongoing learning experiences in which 
comprehensive literacy strategies are embedded.

What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners, 
personally, academically, and culturally?  
Boys and Girls High School has implemented the usage of the Common Core Aligned Springboard Curriculum for ELA 
and Mathematics. Through targeted professional development, teachers will receive support in how to construct 
Regents-aligned instructional tasks. Teachers will align all lessons and units to the Common Core Learning Standards.  

Curriculum from Debating History is used in U.S. History and Government and, New Visions for Public School is used for 
Global History and Geography, Living Environment, and Chemistry courses.  

Professional development will be provided to teachers to support them in utilizing the results from both formative and 
summative assessments to modify and further refine all units of study to meet the needs of all learners. Teachers will 
use frequent checks for understanding to monitor the progress of all students and provide appropriate interventions 
necessary for students with disabilities and English Language Learners. Differentiated lesson plans and common core 
aligned instructional tasks will build students' reading, writing, thinking, listening and speaking skills across all subject 
areas.  

 
 

 

What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be 
career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision? 
In addition to our student advisory, Boys and Girls High School, in collaboration with our CBO, Good Shepherd Services, 
provides extra-curricular programs and activities that consists of life skills training, remediation and support, and 
enrichment activities based on student needs, i.e. Tutoring, Homework Help, opportunities to revisit their work and 
Regents Prep to name a few. Students are given the opportunity to join clubs that will be offered during our Extended 
Learning Time Program (ELT) at least three days per week. Each week we will cycle activities and discussions around our 
school's core values - responsibility, respect, and honesty - in addition to our academic expectations.  Our Student 
Council meets with the principal and support staff on a regular basis to discuss school policies and gain student 
feedback regarding the effectiveness of various initiatives. 
 

What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?  
Modeling exemplars will provide students with clear expectations. Teachers will use research-based instructional 
strategies to provide students with multiple entry points on rigorous tasks. All teachers will engage in professional 
development and instructional meetings that will enable them to create and deliver engaging scaffolded lessons by 
interacting with complex texts in a variety of ways such as graphic organizers, thinking maps, jigsaw etc. Teachers will 
use the results from formative and summative assessments to inform ongoing instruction. Student led conferences and 
feedback will be provided to students during the lesson in small groups and/or individual basis. Student ownership will 
be enhanced as they are able to succinctly articulate their strengths and receive specific guidance on how to improve 
their work. The instruction will be adjusted as necessary and additional modeling will occur when necessary. Teachers 
will provide opportunities for students to assess their own learning using exit slips or another form of self-reflection 
about the day's learning. Opportunities for peer assessment will occur when applicable.  
 

 

 

How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child? 
Teachers will use appropriate pedagogical strategies based on the data to develop lesson and unit plans that ensure 
access, with meaningful progressions for all students. Teachers will plan for various points of entry to text so that all 
students can access at their instructional level and at grade level using activating or supplying background knowledge,

highlighting big ideas using digitized texts, multi-media and audio texts when appropriate. Instructional groups will be 
posted and assignments and directions will be posted using multiple formats such as text and pictures, etc. Specific, 
guiding and open ended questions will be used to scaffold students' critical thinking, that will make concrete 
connections to the real world. 
 

What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and 
summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes? 
Student will engage in pre-assessments at the beginning of all units. Data will be used to drive instruction and inform 
entry points and to what extent differentiation is needed. Item analysis from teacher- created examinations and Mock 
Regents will be used to determine areas of strengths and weaknesses and identify appropriate academic support for 
students.  

 

Teachers will also utilize higher order questions to assess instruction during and after the lesson. Entrance and exit slips, 
surveys, do now activities and other assessment tools will be part of each lesson to assess student learning. Diagnostic 
and formative assessment data will be available for teachers in a timely fashion. Item analyses will be mandated after 
each administered test/assessment.  

 

The New Visions Sorter and Skedula will be used as the technology tool to create and analyze data. The administrative 
cabinet, Cabinet Inquiry Team, OORS instructional coaches and/or department coordinators will meet with teams of 
teachers to facilitate the implementation of data driven instruction ( i.e. item analysis interpretation and the follow-up 
action plan based on those results). Student surveys about each administered test/ assessment will also be 
implemented on trial run this year. Daily common planning times will focus on the analysis of data to modify and/or 
enrich units of study. Weekly professional development will focus on how teachers use the data to strengthen their 
units and strategies. The administration will monitor progress toward credit accumulation.

4.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
5.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

Boys and Girls High School has made a concerted effort to create a safe and nurturing learning environment for 
students, parents, teachers and community stakeholders. The school has created a Parent and Visitor's Welcome Center 
to ensure that our families and community partners are greeted and directed appropriately according to their needs and 
concerns.  

 

Student Advisory, small group structures, and monthly town hall meetings across grade levels and school wide, are 
ongoing and have been established to ensure that student environments are welcoming, safe and supportive. Students 
receive academic support, as well as tools and programs to promote their social and emotional well-being. 

Strengths:  

 

5.2 According to the 2017-2018 Quality Review report, the school has received a rating of Proficient for this Statement 
of Practice. The report sites that 3.4 was an indicator that showed evidence of a culture that communicates high 
expectations to staff, students, and families and provides supports to achieve those expectations. The reviewer found

that school leaders consistently communicate high expectations regarding the use of formative assessment as well as 
literacy across the curriculum. Boys and Girls High School also showed evidence that school leaders and staff ensure that 
parents consistently receive information regarding their children’s paths toward college and career readiness. There was 
a clear alignment between the school’s instructional focus and the district’s priorities. Both are consistently 
communicated in the Principal's weekly newsletter. Two out of the four district priorities are emphasized in ways that 
support teacher growth and holding them accountable for implementation. One such expectation is that teachers use 
formative assessment data to adjust instructional decisions. The other is the purposeful integration of literacy strategies 
across classrooms.  

5.5 According to DTSDE report the school shared her vision for student social and emotional developmental health 
involves expanding the use of restorative justice practices rather than applying only punitive measures to address 
students’ inappropriate behavior. Support staff reported that the school’s advisory curriculum focuses on helping 
students develop healthy relationships and the skills necessary to self-regulate their behavior.  

Areas for Improvement:  

5.4 According to DTSDE report the school the school leaders and the restorative justice coordinator should establish a 
task force charged with developing an action plan for training staff on understanding and implementing restorative 
justice practices. In addition, to the staff named above, the task force should contain, at minimum, one or two teachers, 
one or two social-emotional service providers, one parent, and one or two students. The action plan should contain a 
timeline and benchmarks for implementation, as well as a protocol to evaluate the impact of the initiative.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment 

What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you in partnership with each CBO and families 
enact your vision? 
By June 2019 we will continue to improve school culture and environment by working collaboratively with all school 
stakeholders including the CBO, school staff, students and parents/guardians to ensure a safe, nurturing, supportive, 
and inclusive environment resulting in an attendance rate increase of at least 5% and measured by ATS report and RSAL. 

The Parent Welcome Center continues to be the first stop parents make as they enter the building. In the center they 
are greeted and welcomed by the Parent Coordinator and engaged around a myriad of issues including familial and 
student related problems. Parents/Guardians are also provided a wealth of information and resources as it relates to 
needs.  

The strategic location and access to the CBO has contributed to increasing communication with students, teachers and 
supportive team as well as creating access, visibility and a safe space for students to engage with their Success Coaches 
throughout the day. This has significantly helped to improve the students’ connectedness to the school which in turn 
improves relationships and their daily attendance. Special student and family centered events, enrichment activities in 
collaboration with all stakeholders also help to support schools vision.

How will you in partnership with your CBO will create a supportive environment and engagement for your students’ 
families? 
Good Shepherd, after school activities will include tutoring, homework help, Regents prep, student clubs, Saturday 
Academy, and attendance and social and emotional activities to name a few. The common denominator of these 
diverse outside-the-classroom programs is that they foster student academic achievement in the classroom. Also, our 
Summer Bridge program will help our incoming freshman acclimate to our school culture more readily. The combined 
efforts of the school personnel, the SLT, and the PTA committees will provide parents and families with support on how 
to coordinate efforts of the school and the home.  

Good Shepherd Services works from a strength based perspective with focus on building strong relationships with the 
student, the families, the school and any programs and structured activities that students are involved in. GSS Success 
Coaches support the family, the student and the teachers and provide support them through all aspects of their school 
experience. The Mental Health Counselor and Social Worker is on site daily to provide individual and small group 
workshops focused on mental health and wellness issues such as anxiety and depression, conflict resolution and 
effective communication. The CBO also supports the teacher and students in the classrooms by pushing into weekly 
advisory classes to implement a well-developed educational curriculum which supports the students’ social emotional 
growth. 

In addition GSS supports the Summer Bridge program's incoming Freshmen and provides an introduction of the 
program and services utilized by students at BGHS through-out the school year. This helps the students to acclimate to 
the school more readily and bond with the CBO staff. 

 
 

 
Part 3 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools – Supportive Environment. Your goal must be consistent with the 
expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART – 
Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact 
meeting at least one of your Renewal Benchmarks and/or Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks. 
June 2019, all stakeholders will continue to strengthen school culture where students feel safe, valued and supported by 
the continued implementation of strong student support structures, such as academic and attendance coaching by CBO 
Success Coaches, Mental Health practitioners and community partners whose focus is on health and wellness resulting 
in our attendance rate improving by 5% as well as improved student scholarship.

4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,

4.2 According to the DTSDE report, although staff statements revealed that they share the leader’s vision for 
developmentally appropriate and coherent curriculum and planning, many teachers have yet to provide students with a 
rigorous curriculum that addresses their diverse needs. The report also states that the quality of teacher’s lesson 
planning varies greatly across the school but generally does not address students’ various levels of proficiency.  

4.3 While teachers have begun to align curricula to the CCLS and have embedded primary and secondary resources in 
their analysis, the classrooms do not uniformly provide students with a variety of ways to engage in learning. In many 
classes, students were using worksheets to answer questions without instructional strategies that provide multiple 
points of entry and promote deep understanding and student engagement. The school is working to increase student 
achievement as per the 2017-2018 Quality Review Report and New York State Integrated Intervention Team Report. 
According to the DTSDE report, teachers, some of whom have fewer than three years of experience, are exposed to 
and expected to use a range of best practices. However, some students did not participate in group discussions and 
did not complete group tasks. In some cases, the teacher did not address non-participants, including students who 
completed a task and marked time waiting for the rest of the class to catch up. The team determined that most 
observed instruction was teacher-centered while students listened with varying degrees of attentiveness. 

4.4 According to the 2017-2018 Quality Review report, curricular documents reflect a purposeful integration of 
Common Core Learning Standards and the instructional shifts, and they consistently emphasize rigorous habits and 
higher order skills. The report sites that the approach to curricula development builds coherence and promotes college

and career readiness across grades and subject areas for all students, including English Language Learners (ELLs) and 
students with disabilities. 

 

4.5 According to the DTSDE report, school leaders and some teachers are using data from formative assessments to 
monitor the progress of students, and to identify needs. Teachers still need supports in knowing the level of students’ 
understanding. Feedback given to students did not always provide the guidance needed to improve their work or 
deepen their understanding. The absence of a systemic approach to use data to inform instruction, adjust student 
grouping, and provide appropriate and meaningful feedback to students hinders high levels of student engagement 
and achievement. 

 

Currently, all teachers engage in collaborative meetings on a weekly basis in content area and grade team meetings. 
During these meetings, teachers evaluate data and participate in strategic inquiry to improve student outcomes. 
Agendas and minutes from team meetings reflect data sources used to drive instruction and develop next steps 
and/or plans of actions for various groups. 

According to the recommendation for Tenet 3 (Curriculum Development and Support) in the DTSDE report, using 
previously written lesson plans, teachers, supported by professional development staff, should identify differentiated 
tasks they could have integrated into their lessons. The teachers should develop a repertoire of student-centered 
learning tasks that are differentiated for students achieving below, at, and above proficiency that can be integrated 
into lesson plans. Scaffolds should be included for students achieving below proficiency, and extended learning 
should be included for students above proficiency. All lesson plans should include a three-tiered student-centered 
learning task. School leaders will monitor implementation and provide targeted support as needed.  

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers 

What is your vision for collaborative teaching?   

If teachers and support staff collaborate with a shared vision to improve instruction and implement common core 
aligned and CTE standard aligned instruction with common assessments, then student cognitive engagement in the 
classroom setting will greatly increase, resulting in an increase in student scholarship and Regents examinations at, on, 
or above the college and career level benchmark. Systems and structures have been created to ensure that teams are 
effectively using the Datawise protocol to analyze data to drive instruction and improve student outcomes.  

 

 
 

How do you envision collaboration amongst your School Instructional Cabinet to improve teacher practices and 
student learning? 
The Principal, Assistant Principals, ORS coaches, subject coordinators and teachers will work together to use 
instructional practices and strategies that will align to the CCLS and Instructional plans that are appropriate for groups 
of students at different level of achievement. Teacher leaders and coaches will ensure that data is used to enhance 
instruction in the regular classroom as well as the CTE classes. Additionally, for students who struggle, timely and 
appropriate instructional interventions and extensions will be implemented.

Teachers collaborate in inquiry-based grade and content area teams using protocols that require that they consistently 
analyze student work and performance data as well as their own instructional practices. Cabinet Inquiry strengthens the 
instructional capacity of teachers through targeted support and professional development.  

 
 

 

How do you envision collaboration within teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?  
During common planning, teachers will discuss specific lessons, and strategies for improving each other pedagogue 
practice and evaluate unit plans using a tuning protocol. Assistant Principals and teachers will be trained and how to 
effectively implement the Charlotte Danielson model into the lessons in the classroom and teacher observation. 
Teachers will review student work by engaging in strategic inquiry and modify lessons to accelerate the learning in their 
classrooms. 
 

 

How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?  
Teacher teams will be provided with common planning times at least two times a week. Each department will present

What data will teachers and the School Instructional Cabinet regularly review to ensure that they are reflecting upon 
their teaching practices and meeting individual student learning needs?  What is the intent for reviewing each piece of 
data? (ex. Teachers will regularly review student IEPs when developing lessons in order to ensure that tasks are 
appropriately scaffolded.)

By June 2019 in collaboration with the Principal, administrative cabinet, teacher and support staff, CBOs, Parent 
Coordinator, and Parent Teacher Association, we will increase parent participation by 25% and continue to engage 
and support parents by providing aggressive outreach and engagement, targeted workshops that include teaching 
leadership skills ,along with family activities and events. These strategies will enhance parents understanding around 
students’ academic needs, increase their confidence as they transfer their newly learned skills and encourage parents 
to support their child at home.

Effective Leadership Vision: 

 

Boys and Girls High School is utilizing common core aligned curriculum across all disciplines to ensure that it is follows 
the sequence of CCLS and content standards. Teachers have been provided with coherent curriculum and develop 
instructional plans that are engaging and meets the needs of all learners to improve student outcomes.  

Teachers also utilize both formative and summative assessments to plan goals and objectives as well as modify teaching 
strategies to meet their diverse groups of learners. Student assessment data is used as catalyst for modifications and 
self-reflection to identify how students learn best and adjust lessons and instructional plans accordingly. The usage of 
student led conferences assist our student population in taking more responsibility for their own learning, by providing 
them with targeted feedback on how they can improve. 

The school leader shapes the vision of academic success for all students, creates a climate hospitable to education, 
cultivates leadership in others, improves instruction and manages people, data and processes to foster school 
improvement. A good principal needs to be able to keep the focus on important initiatives and culture characteristics 
that have an impact on student learning and achievement. They establish accountability measures to hold teachers and 
students accountable for learning. 

2.4- The teacher leaders and administrators at BGHS participate in Cabinet Inquiry where they conduct ongoing 
walkthrough cycles on teachers targeted for their APPR scores in the Danielson domain components. Teachers were 
given the rubric for the walkthrough and given feedback from their teacher leader about the results and next steps 
after every walkthrough cycle. The team convenes every cycle to discuss their findings and next steps to improve the 
instructional practices for the teachers. The teachers chosen for this action research are not always receptive to the 
process and the feedback. The team tries new ways to inform the staff that this is supportive and not punitive but 
there is still some unwillingness to participate. The priority need for the team is in the Domain 3b, c, and d 
components. The team worked on 3d: Assessment this past term and will continue to work on it in the Fall 2018 using 
the data we received from the 2017-2018 Quality Review Report, New York State Integrated Intervention Team 
Report and the final APPR scores. 

2.5-The Cabinet Inquiry team utilized the results of the APPR scores from the previous year as a tool to target the 
components that affect the level of instruction for our students and areas of need for the teacher as the Cabinet 
Inquiry focus. The team uses that data to see the correlation between the teaching and learning process and identify 
the challenges and ways to combat the challenges with providing supports for the teachers. The team needs more 
time to mentor the teacher that have challenges so that they can model strategies for the focus group. 

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Effective School Leadership 

What is your vision for effective school leadership at your school? 

 
 
2018-19 RSCEP-O                                                                                                                                                                                                     52 

 

If the Principal creates a culture in which the professional growth of all teachers and staff is supported and developed, 
then a highly skilled and collaborative learning community will emerge in which everyone is nurtured, thereby modeling 
the pedagogy of love philosophy and fostering life-long learning for Boys and Girls High School students and positively 
impacting student graduation rates.  

 

 

2018-2019 Effective School Leadership 

By June 2019, school leaders will effectively use evidence-based systems such as Advance and Cabinet Inquiry cycles to 
provide teachers with ongoing, actionable feedback that will lead to improved teacher practices and result in the 
Framework: Effective School Leadership that will increase by a least 2% as measured by the School Quality Snapshot.  

 

 
 

On which aspects of your own leadership do you plan to focus for the upcoming school year? 
This year school leaders plan to work on building the leadership capacity of all stakeholders including teachers, parents 
and students. Using distributive leadership, teachers will be engaged in peer observations and inter-visitations to 
increase teacher capacity. The administrative cabinet and department lead teachers work together during cabinet 
inquiry to evaluate instructional practices that may be impacting student outcomes. 
 

What is your vision for ensuring that everyone in your schools has a normed and shared understanding of the school’s 
vision, mission, and instructional focus?  
School leaders will work with staff members to refine the school's mission and vision in a collaborative manner. 
Teachers will engage in a series of activities that will help them come up with a vision for their classrooms. Parents will 
also engage in a similar process to further develop a common understanding of the school's vision, mission and 
instructional focus. 

All staff members will be able to participate in exercises that help us clearly define our aforementioned instructional 
focus. There will be a clearly understanding on how our focus will impact teacher and team planning of units and lesson 
plans that meet the needs of all learners. There will be a clear understand how to incorporate our instructional focus 
into their daily lesson-planning.  
 

 

 
 

What is your vision for developing differentiated leadership throughout your school? How will you utilize teacher 
leaders to build broad capacity within your school?  
Assistant Principals, Lead Teacher, Teachers and support staff, will complete a self-reflection form that will highlight 
their strengths and areas for improvement. Professional development offerings will be aligned to what teachers are 
interested in or topics they need more information about. Teacher leaders will be established on each grade and the 
school will utilize the common core library professional resources to build human capital throughout the school. 
Teachers will also lead workshops for other teachers as well as parents. Trained teachers, leaders and coordinators will 
implement, coordinate and conduct common planning meetings.

How will the leader foster collaborative school governance processes, and ensure full family participation together 
with other stakeholders? 
The School Leadership Team will lead the collaborative school governance process by ensuring that we reach out to all 
stakeholders within the school community and abroad. Monthly parent engagement activities will focus on the 
Common Core and NYS Standards to help educate our families about what their children are learning in school. 
Community partnerships will be established to assist bring in more resources into the school.  
 

How often will the school leader conduct observations?  How quickly will school leader share actionable feedback with 
teachers? How will school leader ensure accuracy and provide support to teachers based on observation feedback?

Feedback will be provided to 
teachers after each observation. 
 

Informal and formal feedback will be given to 
teachersin a timely mannerafter each lesson and within 
a week an observation report will be generated in 
Advance and will be vetted for accuracy by the school's 
administrators. Support for teachers will be customized 
to meet their specific needs or the needs of the grade 
level team. School leaders will provide teachers with 
specific and timely feedback on our instructional focus. 
The administrative cabinet will work with the 
instructional lead teachers to identify appropriate 
classes for intervisitationsbased on targeted feedback. 
 

What kind of evidence based systems would a school leader put in place to ensure that the school and individuals 
continues to improve? What kind of supports? Who would he/she collaborate with?

Teachers programs are developed by license area and include common planning and preparation periods that help 
foster teacher reflection and collaboration. Student programs are organized based on grade level expectations and 
student interest. Fiscal capital will be used to further strengthen the alignment of the Common Core and NYS standards 
including providing multiple entry points to meet the needs of all students including English Language Learners and 
students with disabilities. Intervention in Reading and Mathematics will be scheduled during the day and during our ELT 
program to further support student achievement.

Strengths:  

6.2 According to the 2017-2018 Quality Review report, Parents agreed that they receive ample information regarding 
their children’s grades, assignment completion, and overall academic well-being from an online grading, 
communication, and information sharing platform. The ability to communicate directly with teachers is appreciate with 
parents. One parent stated that she was aware that her daughter was scheduled to retake a math Regents exam to get a 
higher grade. Another shared that she receives texts frequently and is kept abreast of missing assignments and 
tardiness. A few parents stated that there had been instances when some teachers hared websites that could support 
their children’s learning from home. 

6.4 The establishment of the Parent Leadership Academy at Boys and Girls High School will provide opportunities for 
parents and guardians to participate in a year-long workshop series designed to provide training and support across all 
areas, including academic and social-emotional development. 

6.5 The school provides opportunities for families to learn, understand, and use academic data. Teachers and support 
staff attend ongoing workshops on topics such as understanding progress data, Regents data, and the Pupil Path student 
management system. Parents have access to academic data online through the Pupil Path, a web-based communication 
system that allows students and parents to monitor student progress online. In addition, teachers are able to send 
comments to teachers through the online system, as well as Kinvolved. By providing families with multiple opportunities

to understand student data, the school helps further parents’ ability to follow student progress and provide supports at 
home.  

 

Areas for Improvement:  

According to the DTSDE report, the recommendation made by the IIT was that the school leaders should evaluate the 
frequency and quality of teacher’s parent outreach activities on a monthly basis. School leaders should develop a rubric 
to be shared with the staff for evaluating the outreach efforts. The evaluation should utilize a monthly summary report 
prepared by the parent coordinator documenting teacher’s parent outreach efforts as recorded in their teacher logs. 
The IIT could not determine if all staff members engaged in weekly parent engagement activities during their 35-minute 
period on Tuesday afternoon. Parent logs viewed did not include the date of parent contact, whether there was an 
exchange between the teacher and the parent, or the outcome of the contact.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Strong Family and Community Ties 

What is your vision for having strong family and community ties at your school? 

If the school leaders, staff and Community Based Organization (CB0) at BGHS partner with the school community and 
families through continuous communication and providing community services, then families will be actively engaged in 
promoting student efficacy and cultural habits of our student body. 

 

 

Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the school 
community?  What support will administrators, teachers, school staff and school safety officers be given to help create 
a welcoming environment?   Will there be a dedicated space for families in the school? 
 
Boys and Girls High School will continue to partner with our community-based organization, Good Shepherd Services to 
engage families, support student achievement and academic progress, and gather attendance, progress and social 
emotional data. The school will work with the Community School Director to ensure that parents always feel welcomed 
in the school community and always havesomeone who can communicate with them in their native language. Pursuant 
to Chancellor's Regulations A-663, we will ensure limited English-speaking parents are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child's education. 

Parents will actively engage families in the Parent and Visitors Welcome Center, where they can utilize technology to 
check student data, receive information regarding academics, social service supports and college and career programs. 
The parent coordinator will also work closely with the Community School Director to develop partnerships with local 
organizations that meet the needs of the families in our school. 

Additionally: 

• Teachers will continue to use the time allotted on a weekly basis to meet with parents either in person or by

can improve their work not only on the current task but also for the future tasks.

• A Parent Workshop calendar will be developed to provide parents with workshops to support them with their child's 
education. Thus promoting student efficacy, student ownership, and parental engagement. 

• Boys and Girls High School will continue to institute a parental involvement policy that supports and respects all 
families, recognizing cultural and religious diversity. 

• The school will continue to articulate high expectations to parents and guardians in an effort to stress the significance 
of student periodic common assessment results, report cards and skills analysis of their children’s performance on State 
standardized assessments. 

• Parent and community satisfaction will be gauged through the administration of a school specific parent survey and by 
administering the School Survey. Data from the formal and informal parent surveys will inform goal setting and planning 
that addresses parent and community needs. 

 
 

 

 How will the school identify and develop families to take leadership roles in school decision making/school 
governance structures? 
 
The School Leadership Team (SLT), Parent Teacher Association, Parent Coordinator, Administrative Cabinet, Cabinet 
Inquiry, Peer-Collaborative Teachers, Community-Based Organization, Community Engagement Team, parents and 
students all play an integral role in the governance of the school. The SLT is comprised of an equal number of parents 
and school personnel. Each month the team meets to decide on the direction of the school. The SLT is also well 
represented as part of the Community Engagement Team (CET). The role of the CET is to make timely decisions about 
the path that the community school program will take in supporting students and families. In addition, we will fully 
implement a parent athletic council to expand our parent voices in our athletic department. 
 

 
 

 

How will the school engage the community and families? How will they ensure that teachers are able to learn from 
families about the children being taught? 
Parents are a part of the SLT and the CET. The School Leadership meets with the Principal on a monthly basis. In 
addition, there are monthly parent-staff forums, informational sessions, town hall meetings, and workshops hosted by 
administration, parent coordinator, Good Shepherd Services, and the Athletic Council. The School Leadership Team is 
not only inclusive of staff members, but must include an equal number of parents. The United Federation of Teachers 
(UFT) chairperson is also a requisite member of the team. The chair person’s role is to adequately represent all teachers 
and provide them with information from these meetings. Further, the principal and the assistant principals supervise all 
academic areas and passes down information from monthly meetings and forums. In short, all of the constituents of the 
school community meet regularly to discuss, decide and disseminate information about how children are taught. 
Parents will also be engaged in different school wide activities such as Parent Teacher Conferences, senior information 
night, freshmen orientation, curriculum night, etc. Skedula, Kinvolvedand School Messenger, will be used as a timely 
and an effective communication tool as well as the school website.  
 

What types of supports does the school provide to families to encourage them to take an active role in what their 
child is learning?

Type of Support 

Rationale 

Telephone calls to parents to inform them about school 
events and student issues. 

PTA meetings provide information about school programs 
and events. 

Frequent communications in form of letters, notices and 
bulletins sent home to parents in English and other 
languages that are predominant in the school. 

Parents do not always come to school, nor do they always 
get notices home (especially from high school students). 
Telephone calls are a very good method of communicating 
with parents.  

 

Boys and Girls High School will provide opportunities for 
parents to pursue higher education opportunities through 
college courses in conjunction with Touro College 
beginning in the fall of 2018. 

Information about events and programs is essential in 
order for parents to be active partners in the education of 
their child. 

 

Two (2) parent meetings will be held per month to involve 
parents who have religious obligations and/or scheduling 
conflicts to ensure greater parent involvement. 

Parents can be active partners if they are informed about 
school programs for their children and for themselves. 
Communication with parents via letters and notices will 
enable parents to take an active role in the school. 

How do families partner with the school and CBO to support student success?  Will there be dedicated space for 
families?   
Family partnerships with 
school: 

Parents are part of the SLT and play a role in determining the direction of the school 
through the development of the Educational Plans. 
 
Parents are part of the Community Educational Team (CET) and play a role in 
determining the direction of the Community School program. 

Family partnerships with CBO: 

Is there dedicated space for 
these partnerships? 

Parents engage with CBO staff around student and family issues and also attend CBO 
led family centered events. 
 
Yes. The Parent and Community Welcome Center and the Care Center is an inviting 
space andhas tables, chairs, a computer, telephone and educational and socio-
emotional resources.Parents are welcomed to spend any amount of time in this 
room. 
 

What is your vision for the role the school will take in providing access adult education classes within the community? 

We will provide opportunities for parents within the Community School program to advance their personal education 
and well-being by accessing adult education classes. Adult education instruction emphasizes skills related to adult

literacy needs, educational goals, and personal interests. Real-world materials are used to enhance the educational 
experience of the adult learner. Adults enrolled in classes can begin with basic literacy skills and advance to high school 
equivalency preparation and vocational training. Some of the programs offered include English as a second language, 
high school equivalency diploma studies and career and technical education. In addition, adult education classes will be 
scheduled to train parent in skedula, transcript evaluation, etc 
 

What data and student progress feedback loops will be present at the school to ensure that families knowledgeable of 
their children’s scholastic success? 
Data will include attendance, student achievement and progress, as well as social emotional information from the 
guidance counselor, Lutheran Medical Center and/or the success coaches to provide feedback to parents and to inform 
the school's staff of gaps that exist in academic and social emotional areas.  
 

 
Part 3 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this

Section 6: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) Program Description  

 

Directions: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) activities are directly aligned to the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environments, and Strong Family and Community Ties. ELT provides enriching 
educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship-
building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and 
extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring 
that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200 
additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of 
instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in 
grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced 
curriculum that can include ELA, math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections 
on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.  
 
Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s) 

Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Goals for ELT should align to the 
Renewal Benchmarks.  How will the school will ensure that all students’ individual needs are served during the 
Renewal ELT and how the school’s vision for ELT will impact both academic achievement and social emotional 
growth? Be sure to construct the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
By ensuring ELT and enrichment time, students have access to activities and clubs that are engaging and academically 
rigorous and supportive, and facilitates positive relationships amongst students, staff, and the school community as a 
whole. Students’ participation is carefully planned by students, parents, teachers and school guidance personnel in 
some cases, so that individual needs are met with regard to self-improvement and academic success. 

 

The specific goals of the program are: 

  By June 2019, there will be at least a 5% increase in the school's course passing rate compared to last June's 

course passing rate, as measured by STARS. 

  By June 2019, there will be at least a 5% increase in the New York State ELA Regents passing scores compared 

to last June's ELA passing scores, as measured by STARS. 

  By June 2019, our school's graduation rate will meet or exceed the 67% Renewal benchmark as measured by 

our School Quality Snapshot and Guide 

  By June 2019, there will be at least a 5% increase in student attendance rate from last year's rate, as 

measured by ATS report, RSAL. 

  By June 2019, our College and Career Preparatory Course Index will meet or exceed the 20.8% Renewal 

benchmark as measured by our School Quality Snapshot and Guide.

4. 

Renewal Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and families 
feel welcome,  actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of their 
schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this  family 
engagement strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Renewal School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work. 

Together with the Principal, school administrators,teachers and Good Shepherd Services led by the Community 
School Director, all will collaborate to meet the Community School benchmarks. The school will leverage the role of 
the CSD in support of our annual goal by incorporating the CSD into the appropriate structures of the school that it 
will address chronic absenteeism, meaningful academic engagement and rigor, mental health and wellness as well as 
transforming and sustaining a safe and nurturing school environment and culture that supports le ring and academic 
success.  

The combined efforts of school personnel and the CSD will be extended into such activities and structures that 
include administrative cabinet meetings, SLT meetings, Student Support Team meetings, and parent involvement. 
Additionally, there will be specific follow-up with an attendance coordinator. The CSD will work closely with the 
schools’ parent coordinator and PTA members to ensure quality parent engagement and support through assertive 
outreach and events that facilitates more parent involvement and students ownership of their academic progress. . 
The CSD will ensure that the community school strategy is implemented at exceptional levels of quality with full 
support of the school administration, staff members and parents. 

The Community School strategy includes structured and organized programming that support the student's academic 
and social emotional growth as well as the schools goals. The Community School structure will provide activities and 
coordination with the school’s academic and social-emotional program by providing leadership and activities to 
support the goals of the program.. The supports include one on one attendance and academic support, advocacy, 
individual and group counseling,family engagement, professional development for staff, teacher classroom support, 
crisis intervention and a comprehensive After school program( ELT) which offers enrichment activates such as 
photography, videography, visual art, tutoring and team building activities. These supports will become part of the 
regular school day that extends beyond the normal school hours. For parents, parenting and educational workshops, 
aggressive outreach efforts, family centered activities and events which support the parent as they encourage and 
strenghthen their child 's academic and emotional success. Career development opportunities are some of the ways 
the family is provided additional support.  

The CSD along with the Community School Team, the Community Associate and the Parent Coordinator will 
coordinate assertive outreach to recruit members, conduct monthly meetings, events and activities to attract 
community members and Community Based Organizations to enhance the existing services in the school. At the 
meetings the team will discuss school and school-related community issues that include research-based best practices 
will be discussed with all of the **stakeholders in attempt to develop a needs assessment and an organized plan for 
resolution of the issues and concerns relating to school and student success and the meeting of the annual goal.  

  

In addition, NYU Lutheran Medical Clinic provides medical, vision and mental health services and helath education 
services to th BGHS campus students. This supports the Community School strategy while providing students access 
to high quality services that address their overall health and wellness.

Section 9: Career and Technical Education (CTE) Programs  

(Requirement for “Out of Time” Priority High Schools) 

Directions: In this section, provide a description of the Career and Technical Education (CTE) program offerings at 
schools in Good Standing that students in this school will have access to during the 2018-19 school year.  
The following courses of study in Career and Technical Education will be offered at BGHS next year: Architectural 
Drafting, Electrical Engineering and Computer Programming. All 9th grade students will participate in a CTE 
exploration course called “Career and Finance.” This course will allow students to receive basic instruction in each of 
the career paths as well as financial literacy strategies. 

During the 2018-2019 school year, the school will apply for national and state certification in each of the courses of 
study.  

A CTE Advisory Committee will be established. This committee, composed of volunteers from industry, business, 
labor, post-secondary education and the non-profit sector, is charged with advising the school leadership, educators, 
parents and students on the development, implementation, administration and evaluation of the BGHS CTE policies 
and programs.  

The mission of the Advisory Committee is to assist the BGHS community in providing all students relevant and 
meaningful Career and Technical Education programs for acquiring high-level academic and workforce preparation 
skills. The work of the Advisory Committee would include: 

● Fostering collaborations among industry, business, labor, post-secondary education, and non-profits in order to 
develop student achievement in CTE courses of study. We will establish a transfer articulation agreement between 
BGHS and one or more post-secondary education, that contains agreed upon courses or programs that graduates will 
be able to transfer to that institution. 

● Connecting Boys and Girls High School to external resources and information needed to ensure that our CTE policies 
and programs are current, relevant, and consistent with industry standards.  

● Reviewing and accessing federal, state, and local funding sources to ensure that necessary funding is in place to 
strengthen the program, 

● Coordinating CTE opportunities for students with disabilities, English Language Learners, and other at risk 
populations, 

● Monitoring access while ensuring integration of these courses into the academic courses offered to all students, 

● Gathering perspectives from CTE students via a student advisory initiative, 

● Informing parents, community leaders, and elected officials about the opportunities and successes at BGHS, 

● Providing students with opportunities to listen to and learn from professionals currently working in the industries, 
and 

Connecting BGHS with other schools offering these courses of study.

Section 10: Professional Development Plan  

(Requirement for “Out of Time” Priority Schools) 

Directions: In this section, provide a description of the mandatory professional development that will be provided to 
school leadership and staff during the 2018-19 school year. Include any professional development that will occur 
during the summer months. 
It is the vision of the renewal committee that teachers do best when they are given a chance to reflect on their 
pedagogy, identify their priority needs and drive their own professional learning. This will be done on the professional 
development committee in collaboration with administration, the UFT and the school renewal initiative. 

Shared leadership and decision making is a primary component of BGHS’s collaborative culture. BGHS will epitomize a 
truly innovative model of positive collaboration, expanded opportunities for success and functioning professional 
relationships.  

  

Professional Development to improve alignment of curricula  

The school will execute a systematic PD plan that consists of group learning activities and individual coaching . The 
Professional Learning Committee (consisting of UFT members, SRI coaches, and School leaders) will provide oversight 
and support to this ongoing work. In instituting structures to ensure positive and regular collaboration, BGHS will refer 
to the following data to gauge efficacy and make necessary modifications: attendance, anecdotals, survey results, 
student participation in after-school clubs and activities, student credit accumulation, classroom observations, ‘check-
ins’ and ‘exit slips’ retrieved during advisory periods, reports from Parent Engagement time and communication from 
cooperating CBO staff. Integration of technology tools like Google Drive to facilitate conversation, sharing of 
materials, etc. Integration of technology tools like Google Drive to facilitate conversation, sharing of materials, etc. 

Group Learning Activities:  

Teams will be convened in the following structures: 

● Grade level inquiry teams (horizontal alignment). 9th and 10th grade teams will engage in WITsi strategic inquiry for 
a minimum of 80 minutes and collaboratively analyze teacher tasks and student work. However, 90 minutes per week 
is ideal for this work. Interdisciplinary teaching teams will develop and refine student protocols (e.g. WiTSI), project 
and performance based learning activities, socratic seminars, student research projects, school wide student work 
projects et al. 

● Department team meetings (vertical alignment) 

○ Department teaching teams will plan lessons, units, student-centered activities et al. Department teams will also 
conduct inquiry cycles of student work. Members of the BGHS Professional Learning Committee will create a form 
that will guide inquiry cycles (e.g. looking at student work, assessing student needs, customizing pedagogical 
approaches and activities, assessing student growth). These teams will also engage in recurring cycles of collective 
inquiry and action research to address student learning needs to impact learning outcomes. 

Intervisitation-  

● Members of the BGHS community will conduct regular informal classroom intervisitation and learning walks.  

New educator mentoring-

● Staff members with 1-2 years experience will meet with an assigned mentor weekly during their professional 
activity period (when not meeting in teams) or during other professional work time on Tuesdays. Mentors and 
mentees will review curriculum, classroom policies and procedures, pedagogical and classroom management 
challenges and best practices et al. 

Summer Bridge Academy for Students 

● In conjunction with the Summer Bridge Academy for Students for incoming 9th grade students there will be a one 
day training that commences on the first day of summer school. This will include support around developing 
assessments, reviewing course outline and multiple entry points for the summer. Teachers will be supported by the 
administration in developing lesson plans that include multiple entry points. 

Ongoing cycles - Weekly PD, Election Day, etc 

● SRI PD for EngageNY and WITsi (multiple ongoing sessions approximately monthly) 

● Early in September - A strong classroom culture, Instructional objectives as outlined by Danielson, and Using Hess’s 
Rigor Matrix to design rigorous tasks 

● Recurring curricula unpacking and adaptation throughout the year in order to ensure that EngageNY meets the 
needs of diverse learners 

● Recurring opportunities to look at student work (including assessments) and inquiry protocols in the teacher team 
context throughout the year for the purpose of curricula and/or pedagogical modifications. 

● Details of this plan, cycles, etc will be fleshed out where possible - ie WITsi and Curricula EngageNY calendar will be 
determined by the PD committee during the week of September 5th. 

Model Classrooms  

 

Model classrooms will be developed to support teacher growth and will act as labs where colleagues can come to 
watch pedagogical, content planning and behavior management best practices. These classrooms will be taught by 
both Peer Collaborative and Model teachers who will receive compensation in the form of either an annual salary 
boost and/or an extra planning period. These roles will also provide additional opportunities for teachers to assume 
leadership roles to grow professionally, and share their instructional practices with peers, while remaining in the 
classroom.  

● Model Teachers use their classrooms to serve as a laboratory and resource to support the professional growth of 
colleagues. Working closely with other teacher leaders, the Model Teacher is a resource to other teachers by 
demonstrating effective teaching strategies. This position will also be responsible for serving on the professional

Section 11: Support for Students in Temporary Housing (STH)  

 

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

 

There are 
currently 
46 
Students 
in 
Temporary 
Housing in 
our school 
as of June 
30, 2018. 

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

The McKinney-Vento questionnaire is useful in identifying doubled-up students. Doubled-up students are typically 
students who have been left homeless as a result of their losing their homes. Parents move in with other families to 
create a situation that is crowded and difficult for both families. 

Teacher training will be conducted so that it can include topics such as understanding the specific behaviors and 
tendencies of traumatized youth and approaches to in the classroom. It is useful in enabling staff members to 
regularly provide students with ways to discuss and model making good choices. 

Several approaches have proven helpful in addressing doubled-up homeless students. 

  Teacher/Guidance teams work with doubled-up students by building strong personal relationships that build 

 

 

trust and sense of being supported by the school. 
Students who are doubled-up required additional behavioral support as a result of the potential for 
problematic behavior as indicative of the student's state of mind as a result of their life situation. In addition, 
the school support team, headed by guidance personnel will have professional development workshops for 
the staff. 
Students need personal attention since their life situation (doubled-up) can create a traumatized situation for 
them. The school support team will provide these students with teacher mentors. This will help students 
maintain an aura of self-confidence (or a restoration of self-confidence).

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (R/SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 

 
 
2018-19 RSCEP-O                                                                                                                                                                                                     88 

 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/R/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent Involvement Policy and aligned with student 
achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG or SIF funds: These funds 

must be used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant 
application.

Section 13: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Boys and Girls High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A 
of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Boys and Girls High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Grecian Harrison, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
