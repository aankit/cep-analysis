Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mott Hall Bridges Academy is a STEAM focused middle school located in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. Our 
mission is to prepare our scholars for the 21st century, by cultivating in them the skills of critical thinking, 
collaboration, compassion and communication. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Mott Hall Bridges Academy is small middle school, serving 6-8th grade, comprised of 200 scholars, who present 
challenges academically and social-emotionally due to low proficiency rates and living in poverty. Current 
demongraphic: 94% below poverty level, 31% Special Education , 83% Black, 16% Hispanic, 1% Asian, 53% males, 47% 
females. During the 2017-2018 school year our school's attendance rate was Understanding the needs of our school 
community the SLT has engaged in strategic planning to develop partnerships that will offer opportunities to extend 
our scholars learning beyond the school building; allocating funding that align to our school's goals that will ensure 
the hiring and retention of qualified teachers, as well as offering academic support and enrichment classes.  

Unique and Important Characteristics: 

  Our college and career readiness program includes partnerships with Harvard and Yale, along with various 
private and CUNY schools to provide our scholars with field trips to learn about preparation, expectations, 
and financial support to attend college.  

  The MHBA Legacy Association allows alumni to receive support in their transition to high school and offers 

 

 

workshops, tours, and scholarships for college. 
Integrated Algebra regents are administered to scholars who demonstrate an 80% or more on formative 
assessments (unit plans, quizzes) and benchmarks over the course of the academic year in 6th and 7th grade 
year. 
Scholars attend cultural institution that relate to Science and Art instruction to reinforcement classroom 
instruction that continues to building on the inquiry process of observations, discussion and questioning. 

  Our community garden offers our school community the opportunity to grow produce and learn the value of 

developing healthy habits to decrease the incidence of health risks within the Brownsville community. 
Scholars and staff maintain the garden, along with parental volunteers.  

  The entire 7th grade is required to complete the Networking for Teaching Entrepreneurship program to learn 

financial literacy, how to design a business plan, pitching an idea, and investing in their community.  

  We transform our school into an art gallery to highlight the arts in our STEAM focused curriculum that is 

college and career ready aligned through common core standards. 

  Our guidance counselor works collaboratively with parents to select the “right” high school based on the 

 

 

needs of our scholars and ability to manage transition in a large or small high school setting. 
In collaboration with SONYC-Purelelements, we received a middle school grant for after-school, which allows 
our scholars to received enrichment through academic support and arts programming. 
Social emotional support through 6th character education, 8th grade guidance class, and our school-wide 
Champion advisory that meets with all scholars on a weekly basis. Additionally we partner with the NYC 
Department of Health and Brookdale Hospital to offer our scholars and their families workshops on health 
and wellness.  

  Teacher work collaboratively to create curriculum, develop school-wide programs, and identify skills that will 

be taught across all grade levels and departments. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

There are 32% of scholars classified with special needs only 10% meet the NYS Standards for ELA, and 11% meet the 
standards for math. They receive additional academic support during after-school and on Saturdays.Many of our 
scholars require mandated and at-risk counseling, along with small group instructional support that takes place during 
our scheduled intervention classes, lunchtime, after school and Saturday academy. During the 2017-2018 school year 
there were not ELL's scholars enrolled.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

According to the 2017 -2018 Learning Environment Survey, 100% of our teachers agreed that there is a strong teacher 
collaboration to develop curriculum and share best practices. Our goal for the 2018-2019 the goal will be to use data 
effectively to reflect on instructional practices that will improve scholars achievement, which will be evident in the 
2018-2019 Advance Measure of Teacher Practice (MOTP) domain 3d use of assessments in instruction and 4a 
professional responsibilities.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Over the years the teaching staff at MHBA has been working collaboratively to develop lesson plans that are aligned 
to the common core standards. On the 2017-2018 NYC School Quality guide, only 77% of scholars indicated that they 
are challenged in class, 63% responded that their teachers ask them difficult questions on test, and 66% responded 
that teachers ask difficult question on tests. Additionally on the Student Perception Survey, scholars indicated that 
only 82% considered teachers to have rigorous expectations in the class. This is a 9% decline from the previous year.  

After reviewing the data, it is evident that teacher teams will need to focus on evaluating lesson plans and teacher 
made assessments for the use of questions that are common core aligned. Furthermore, they will need to analyze of 
scholars work to evaluate the rigor of the task assigned.  

- Professional developments sessions will center on how to analyze lesson plans and scholars work for rigor, as well as 
how to design higher-level thinking questions using the depth of knowledge chart.  

- Administration will conduct class room observations that will be recorded in advance to monitor the rigor of 
instruction by focusing on 1a content and pedagogy (planning and preparation) and 3b (questioning and discussion). 
Feedback will be given within 24 hours to discuss observed practices, targeted areas of improvement, and strategies 
to improve instruction.  

- Teachers will engage in intervisitions to observe colleagues practices using the Danielson rubric focusing on 1a and 
3b. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 100% of teacher will engage in professional development sessions and teacher team meetings that focus 
on the development of rigorous questions that are common core aligned. This will be evident by 75% of teachers 
achieving effective or a highly effective rating for the indicators 1a and 3b, on the Advance Measure of Teaching

school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
According to the 2018 NYC DOE School Quality Guide Report, we scored a 4.03 in the domain for the supportive 
environment. Based on the questions asked on the survey, 66% of scholars stated that scholars listen to teachers 
directions, 64% of scholars say most scholars follow the rules in class, 69% say that most scholars pay attention when 
they are suppose to, and 71% say that most scholars when they are suppose to. Compared to the 63% on the 2016-
2017 Learning Environment survey, there was a decrease to 59% indicating that most scholars behave well even when 
teachers isn't watching.  

Creating a culture of learning and respect is a top priority in our school environment, yet the result demonstrate a gap 
between expectations and behaviors within our classrooms.  

* Our Champion program that provides all scholar with an advisor will offer the opportunity for small targeted 
support to share expectations, provide a mentor accountable for 12 scholars to model appropriate behaviors in the 
school, and follow up with teachers, by serving as a liaison between staff and scholars. 

* Single Shepherds will provide additional social emotional support for at-risk scholars who will be identified through 
classroom observations they will conduct on a weekly basis and teacher referrals. 

* Parents will receive strategies to support scholars with academic and social-emotional needs to best support their 
scholars at home and how to manage relationships with school personnel to cultivate a learning partnership. 

* Scholars and teachers will be surveyed on the school level in November and May to gather feedback and measure 
data for progress and implement interventions as needed. 

* An behavior incentive response initiative will be spearheaded by teachers to manage behaviors and recognize 
improvements school-wide.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

During the 2017 - 2018 school year the administrative team adapted a shared leadership model, which placed more 
emphasis on teacher leaders to manage departments and grade levels with respect to the planning of instruction. 
According to the 2018 NYCDOE School 88% of teachers responded that they take responsibility for improving school. 
However only 71% say teachers are eager to try new ideas, which is an area we want to see improved through teacher 
collaboration and teacher team meetings.  

The administrative team will continue to focus on building our teachers capacity by providing targeted professional 
development and leadership strategies that will support the implementation of new ideas. Periodic observations of 
meeting and the evaluation of artifacts cross-referenced with a check-list will provide team leads with feedback for 
improvement.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, school leaders will ensure that 100% of MHBA Team Leads build their capacity to effectively facilitate 
professional learning meeting by meeting 80% of the established criteria.

According to the NYCDOE School Survey, 80% of parents responded that they have had opportunities to volunteer at 
the school. The overall challenge, based on PTA and activity sign in sheets only 2.5% of parents are actively engaged in 
parent teachers association, which is .5% decrease from the 2016-2017 survey results . Although our most successful 
events include our annual Multi-Cultural Day in which families volunteer to prepare meals and serve our scholars 
lunch, as well as our bi-annual Sip and Chat painting workshops, most of our parents do not actively engage in PTA 
activities. We consider our parents as partners and we value their feedback as well as participation on various 
committees. Parents receive updates on school wide expectations, grading policies, and strategies in our school's 
parent weekly. Monthly letters are sent out to communicate high expectations and prioritizing academic excellence. 
Additionally, a bi-weekly parent weekly to update our families on school-wide activities and parent workshops that 
have been scheduled. 

We intend to implement the use of the School NXT App to communicate with our parents directly and create groups 
that target their specific needs or interest. By engaging them with a real time response app that is accessible, our goal 
is to increase parental engagement.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-

quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Mott Hall Bridges Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part 
A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy 
to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Mott Hall Bridges Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand; 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; 

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; 
conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The school uses the 2017 NYSESLAT results and Fontas and Pinnell's independent reading level  and writing skills to assess 
ELLs.  The assessments indicates students overall strength and weakness in Phonemic Awareness  and reading 
comprehension.  This data helps inform our school's instructional plan by indicating that a significant portion of instructional 
time should be dedicated to phonemic awareness as  well as letter and word recognition. 
       
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The ESL teacher works in collaboration with the Special Education teacher to identify resources that are available to support 
our ESL population. During department meeting the ESL teacher participates in the analysis of scholars work to determine 
instructional gaps that will inform strategies to implement for support.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our ELL program is determined by scores on the NYSESLAT.  The movement a students make from one 
performance level to another over several years is another indicator of the effectiveness of the ELL program.  We are clearly 
focused on the students' scale score and performance level on the NYS ELA and Math exams.  In addition, classroom progress 
and student's participation is another indicator of the success of the programs for ELL.     
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

During teacher team and department meeting, interventions are discussed and evaluated for effectiveness by analyzing 
assessments and scholars work to determine specific academic gaps.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to question here:    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The results of the 2017 NYSESLAT must be reviewed 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 
Results are shared during the cabinet meeting at the beginning of the school year that includes the ESL teacher. The 
implications for instructions are discussed and strategies to best support our ESL population are determined and shared during 
department meeting. Strategies are then implemented and monitored by the administration team through classroom 
observations and evaluation of data.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction is delivered in a collaborative fashion where the ESL teacher works together with the general education 
and other subject area teachers to plan instruction in a differentiating matter to meet the needs of all English 
Language Learners in the school. The ESL teaher works together with other teachers to differentiate instruction so 
that all students are able to understand the lesson being taught.  The organizational model for instruction is pull out 
method.  Instruction in this class are differentiated and students are group based on their levels, their understanding 
of the English langage, and skill that is being taught that period.  The ESL teacher work closely with the ESL students to 
make sure that they understand what is being taught in the class.  During the pull out sessions, students work on 
reading, writing, and communicating in English.  Focus is also placed on preparing the students for the NYSESLAT and 
the different assessment that the students will be required to take that school year.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 All staff members in the building are given a schedule that notifies the teachers of all ESL students, their proficiency levels, 
how many hours they are required by the law to be serviced based on their proficiency level, and when they will be 
serviced.  Students labeled as beginners and intermediate receive 360 minutes of instruction per week in pull out 
method.  Advance students receive 180 minutes of instruction in pull out method.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
A certified ESL teacher will provide ESL as required by the student's proficiency level.  This will be as a pul out model for the 
students which will be programmed and scheduled in an alternative setting. One ELL student is proficient in the Reading/ 
Writing and Speaking section of the NYSESLAT.  The other ESL student is proficient in the Speaking section of the 
NYSESLAT.  The ESL teacher provides 180 minutes a week to the advanced students.  The ELA mandated units will be provided 
by the certified ELA teacher.  Our school currently has a part-time ESL teacher who provides services to students and 
collaborate with the ELA teachers to ensure students are receiving adequate support and understanding of strategies and skill 
taught to improve academic progress.  Students receive 4 periods of ESL with a certified ESL teacher and the ELA mandated 
units will be given to students

SIFE Students 
Although Mott Hall Bridges Academy does not have any Students with Interrupted Formal Education. SIFE students would be 
assessed to identify weakness and strengths.  Individualized meetings with parents to provide them with an individual plan 
based on the needs of the SIFE student. A complete assessment for these students will be conducted to find out areas of 
deficiency to help provide necessary teaching and learning strategies.  At the same time, we would refine and enhance 
students' prior knowledge and boost confidence.   They would be supported with ESL and Guidance Intervention support 
services provided by the ESL Teacher and the guidance counselor.  Literacy support would be provided in the classroom as well 
as individual tutoring provided by the ESL Teacher in the student’s native language. 
 
The English Teacher and the ESL Teacher would also utilize a collaborative team teaching approach to address the needs of 
these students.  In addition, the following plans are also used: 
*Making an individualized student needs assessment 
*Creation of an AIS plan for the student focus on the literary and math component 
*Grade appropriate instructional support materials 
*Differentiation of instruction in all areas 
*Staff will receive professional development by the ESL teacher on strategies that benefit SIFE within the classroom  
*Professional development will also be offered in the new ALLAD assessment to identify SIFE students  
*An analysis of their scores on the NYSESLAT, ELA and Math assessment suggest that their problem is one of reading and 
writing.  Our action plan for this group involves:  
*An after school program, targeting reading and writing* 
*Monitoring the progress of students in all content areas to differentiate instruction for literacy needs.

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

All students are given equal access to the different programs that are offered in the school.  They are able to participate in 
everything that is available to any student in their grade level.  Students are able to attend the after-school program where 
they will work on ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies and communication.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Technology plays a big role in our ESL program.  The teacher has access to IPADS, computers and SMARTBOARD to support ELL 
students.  The NYSESLAT and Beyond is another program that is used to build students in the different modalities.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our Part-time ELL teacher receives professional development through the network.  Professional development will be provided 
to every teacher in our school building on a regular basis by the ESL teacher and principal. All of our teachers will be provided 
with common preparation periods during which the Principal will engage teachers in study group activities and best practices 
for English Language Learners. These workshops are held on a weekly basis on all areas of the curriculum. The Principal, will 
also provide the teachers with professional development in Literacy,  Mathematics, and Language Acquisition.  Differentiated 
Instruction is embedded in all lesson planning and workshops.   
  
Lesson planning, thematic instruction and differentiation of instruction are some of the topics on the agenda. This staff 
development consists of study groups, modeling instruction and outside workshops. Part of the staff development will take 
place after school hours during the school year. Our teachers also attend professional development activities provided by DOE, 
BETAC, and by our Borough Field Support office. Professional Development  support the alignment of curriculum to CCLS to 
support the needs of ELL students through scaffolding to support text complexity, building of vocabulary through visualization 
and providing background knowledge, and use of literary materials that allow students to make connections to content area.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
  
Professional development will be provided by the ESL teacher to Special Education teachers who will receive 10 hours of ELL 
training and general education teachers will receive the 7.5 hours of ELL training as per state mandate. Some of the topics 
include basic ELL background, the school ELL intake, initial language learning  (phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary and 
comprehension instructional strategies), academic vocabulary, childhood and adolescent development considerations, 
technology- based interventions, co-teaching, joint -ESL and classroom teacher goal setting and monitoring, task complexity, 
levels of questioning, and using data such as NYSESLAT and periodic assessment data to drive ELL instruction.  In addition, 
teachers will attend workshops offered by DOE, BETAC and our CFN. These meetings will inform teachers about the 
compliance issues, identification of students as well as testing accommodations and strategies for differentiating and 
supporting ELLs in their classrooms. The school guidance counselor also helps teachers with ELL students.  He helps with 
the  transition from  middle school to high school by involving their parents in the process of learning which schools best meet 
their child’s needs.   
              
  
  
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Paste response to question here: In our school parents are viewed as critical stakeholders in our students' academic 
achievement and as a result considerable efforts are made in order to engage them with knowledge about school events, 
activities and important information as well as strategies to assist their child with homework. Every effort is made to 
communicate in the parent's native language.  All communication materials that are sent to their homes, is translated into 
Spanish (the dominant language of our student body).  Our goal is to encourage families to be actively involved in the learning

community of our school.  The principal, staff and outside agencies will provide multiple workshops throughout the year to 
engage parents in the education of their children.  If we have parents of newly enrolled ELL students, they will be provided 
with two orientation session.  These session include the necessary information regarding their choices for the Transitional 
Bilingual, ESL or Dual Language Programs.  These orientation sessions are separated and apart from regularly scheduled parent 
meetings and are conducted by the staff and the principal.  Some topic that are covered: State standards, assessments, school

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Nadia Lopez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
