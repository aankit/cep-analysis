Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our educators collaboratively created our school mission: "At PS 109, we believe that through collaborative 
partnerships with students, parents, and staff we will build a culture of leaders who act with integrity, resilience, and 
compassion. These leaders are reflective learners, problem solvers, and independent critical thinkers. Together we 
will work hard and positively advocate for our learning, our school community, and the community at large." 
 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 109 The Sedgwick School is a PreK through 5 school with 655 students enrolled. Academic curriculum and 
school activities are planned with the success of each child in mind. We are a Teachers College Reading and Writing 
Project School. Our classroom teachers work closely with our TC Staff Developers, administration, literacy coach, 
grade leaders, and model teachers to share strong instructional practices and ensure that our students are being 
supported and challenged to reach the NYS standards. Students investigate and explore mathematics using the 
EngageNY modules. Our co-teaching and push in ENL program support students in acquiring the English Language 
and accessing the curriculum at their individual entry point. Our Response to Intervention program, IReady, 
supports our at risk students as the instruction is targeted to meet their individual needs. We will continue to place 
our focus on data driven instruction through our continued use of the Tuning Protocol which focuses on examining 
student work. 

 

In addition to PBIS, students' social emotional well- being is supported through our strategic partnership with 
Morningside Center for Teaching Social Responsibility with the use of our 4R's curriculum and personalized staff 
development. As an extension to this curriculum, we have implemented peer mediation to support students with 
conflicts by strengthening communication skills. We have expanded our PBIS committee now entitled the Social 
Emotional Learning Advisory Board to represent all aspects of our SEL initiative which include PBIS, grant writing, 
4R's, and family event planning. Additionally, we currently have a partnership with the School Mental Health 
Consultant Program. The School Mental Health Consultant Program (SMHCP) is part of ThriveNYC, the City’s 
strategic plan to improve and promote the mental health of its residents.  

 

Our school is entering its fourth year as a Learning Partners school. For the last two years, our focus area was 
building the social emotional intelligence of all stakeholders, as well as teacher leadership. We saw a major 
increase in teacher ratings within the area of supportive environment, trust, and teacher influence on the Learning 
Environment survey. As a result, we were able to retain the majority of our teachers. The classroom teachers have 
much more success in managing student behaviors and there is much more joy in learning. The overall tone of the 
entire building is becoming more positive. As such, we have switched our focus area to rigorous instruction. Within 
rigorous instruction, our instructional focus is: If I want to increase student intellectual engagement and use of 
academic vocabulary then I have to differentiate instruction to meet the needs of all sub groups represented in any 
given class by engaging students in data driven, small group work and partner talk. As a Learning Partners school, 
we have developed a problem of practice in the area of mathematics. With the support of our host and partner 
schools, as well as professional literature, we are engaging our model teachers in cycles of inquiry to determine 
next steps for other classroom teachers. 

 

Collaboration with families is essential for our students' success. One of our major ways we’ve increased 
communication with families was with the support of programs “Class Dojo”. This tool allowed teachers and

parents to communicate academic needs and expectations, all while allowing teachers to provide real-time updates 
with any behavioral concerns or school events. Even more, teachers were able to open their classroom doors by 
providing pictures from class celebrations and trips. The use of this tool provides a simple, non threatening way for 
parents to engage with teachers. Parents have more access to their child’s learning and daily operations even when 
they can not attend their child’s school as regularly as they like. Families are invited to classroom celebrations, such 
as their child's writing with "Publishing Parties.” Additionally, grade teams develop and deliver parent workshops 
aligned with the content and expectations of the common core standards. As a result, we have experienced an 
increase in parental involvement and attendance at school events. This year we will expand our parent outreach to 
include monthly Open Houses where parents are invited into classrooms to take part in different content which will 
include a back to school event, spooky story night, math madness and father figure dance. Additionally, families 
have the opportunity to meet with classroom teachers during parental engagement time every Tuesday from 
2:40pm until 3:20pm. Many families use this time frame for to address any areas of concern or their child’s 
academic progress. Last year, we strategically utilized our last parent teacher conference night to host a family 
night. Over the course of the evening, families were invited to engage in activities that showcase our collaboration 
with Edible Schoolyard NYC, Alvin Ailey Theater Program, and our growing visual arts program. 

 

As a school community we recognize that in order to meet the diverse needs of our students and families, the role 
of our school must expand beyond traditional definitions of teaching and learning. We are committed to the well-
being of the "whole child" and support our students by offering a variety of extracurricular and enrichment 
activities. Our school will be continuing our partnership with Edible Schoolyard for a third year. We are working to 
expand our Arts Department with the support of our work with Broadway Bound. This year, our 5th graders 
auditioned for roles in the Wiz, Jr. Students took on a variety of roles in the production from acting, to set 
construction, and sound/lighting. We intend to continue growing our Arts department through our collaboration 
with Alvin Ailey and Broadway Bound.  

 

 

 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The school population comprises of 81% Hispanic, 18% black, 1% white and Asian students. The student body includes 
116 special education students. We also have a full time guidance counselor and crisis intervention team who support 
our staff with our at - risk students. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our school had the most growth in the DTSDE Tenet School Leader Practices and Decisions. At the onset of every 
school year we distribute and review the Employee Policy handbook. The handbook is updated annually and 
delineates instructional expectations, behavioral expectations, and school wide goals aligned to both the Danielson 
Framework of Teaching and the Framework for Great Schools. 

 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12 

 

With regard to teacher leadership, we are at a place where there is equitable distributive leadership. This means 
that teachers lead their grade level team's common planning with the support of administration and the literacy or 
math coach. This school year, we continued to foster the development of our lead teachers as well as additional 
teacher leaders. We further differentiated our professional development to include a menu of teacher led PD cycles 
called “mini courses.” Teachers were supported and challenged based on their instructional strengths and areas of 
need. New teachers were partnered with a mentor trained through the New Teacher Center. We will continue to 
develop additional teacher leaders next year, following the same system of teacher led PD cycles and additional 
onsite and offsite professional development opportunities that are aligned to their areas of growth. 

 

Now in our fifth year of using the Danielson Framework for Teaching, we have consistently communicated the high 
expectations for the level and quality of teacher professionalism, instruction and communication. We continue to 
engage in meaningful discussion, resulting in relevant feedback and individualized teacher action plans. We used 
student data as well as advance data to strategically plan professional development provided through Teachers 
College Reading and Writing Project, Carnegie Learning, instructional coaches, and teacher leaders.  

 

Administrative decisions such as the purposeful staffing, strategic partnering, and use of support staff resources 
and their capabilities have held administrators and staff accountable for continuous improvement.  

 

As a result, our key area of focus this school year will be DTSDE Tenet Teacher Practices and Decisions. This will 
include developing pedagogical skills to address all students needs.

Our school had the most growth in the DTSDE Tenet School Leader Practices and Decisions. At the onset of every 
school year we distribute and review the Employee Policy handbook. The handbook is updated annually and 
delineates instructional expectations, behavioral expectations, and school wide goals aligned to both the Danielson 
Framework of Teaching and the Framework for Great Schools. 

 

With regard to teacher leadership, we are at a place where there is equitable distributive leadership. This means that

Now in our fifth year of using the Danielson Framework for Teaching, we have consistently communicated the high 
expectations for the level and quality of teacher professionalism, instruction and communication. We continue to 
engage in meaningful discussion, resulting in relevant feedback and individualized teacher action plans. We used 
student data as well as advance data to strategically plan professional development provided through Teachers

Administrative decisions such as the purposeful staffing, strategic partnering, and use of support staff resources and 
their capabilities have held administrators and staff accountable for continuous improvement.  

 

As a result, our key area of focus this school year will be DTSDE Tenet Teacher Practices and Decisions. This will 
include developing pedagogical skills to address all students needs.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all teachers will engage in inquiry work, examining and sharing best practices evidenced by data and 
promoting student achievement through teacher teams and differentiated professional development, as measured 
by an overall 10% growth in student proficiency in ELA and Math on the 2019 NYS tests in Grades 3 to 5.

Teachers 

A problem practice protocol will be used across grade levels to 
strengthen our data inquiry and promote the use of data to inform 
instruction. Data inquiry will incorporate the triangulation of data to 
ensure a true representation of students’ abilities and needs. All 
teacher teams and PDs will be grounded in student work samples 
and formative/summative data. 

Teachers are partnered within and across all grades to promote 
vertical planning and sharing of best practices through the use of 
teachers teams, curriculum committees and differentiated 
professional developments.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Parental engagement workshops will be held throughout the school year to inform parents of the expectations of

the back to school night provides families with the opportunity to meet all teachers and learn about grade level 
expectations and content.. 
 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
● Professional Learning sessions – times need to be built into PL calendar to allow for teacher development of 
strategies to support the success of this goal; e.g. how to effectively teach metacognition, strategies to support 
ELLs and SWD, the alignment of Reading and Writing units 

● Administration will need to make checks in walk-throughs to ensure teachers are supporting students in the 
development of this goal 

● Teachers will need to work collaboratively during Common Planning to ensure such practices as close reading and 
creation and use of performance tasks are aligned across the grade

Part 5 – Progress Monitoring  

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By the end of September 2018, Teacher Teams will examine formative assessment products. Student work will be 
analyzed and unit plans adjusted to meet the deficiencies. By February 2019, 25% of all unit plans would have been 
adjusted to reflect modifications based on student needs.  
 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
In February 2019, 50% of the students within the lowest 3rd will show progress on their iReady midyear assessment.  

 

Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

P.S. 109 is a collaborative community that is currently strengthening systems and structures that support the Social 
Emotional development of all stake holders, through the implementation of the Positive Behavior Intervention System 
(PBIS), the 4R's social emotional Learning curriculum from Morningside for Social Justice and the peer mediator/ peace 
helpers initiative.  
 
Spearheading this work is our Social Emotional Learning Advisory Board with the support of a consultant from 
Morningside for Social Justice. We also have a full time guidance counselor and crisis intervention team who support our 
staff with our at - risk students. In addition, a Behavioral specialist will begin working to support students social 
emotional needs.  
 

The school uses the 4R's curriculum from Morningside, along with a consultant that supports in the implementation of 
the program. To continue to build community within the classrooms, teachers are required to hold gatherings during 
morning meetings for the purpose of strengthening student to student and student to teacher relationships.

The leadership team is in the process of assessing the implementation and impact of the SEL curriculum, the work of the 
peer mediators and peace makers and discussing systems for improvement. They are also in the process of learning 
more about restorative circles and how they can impact the social-emotional well-being of our students and staff. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

By June 2018, we will continue to develop a culture of respect and rapport where we promote trust amongst all 
stakeholders. All staff will enhance students’ social-emotional skills by explicitly modeling and reinforcing the 
concepts learned in the Social Emotional Learning (SEL) program to ensure students grow both socially and 
academically with the support of our school's peer mediators and peace helpers resulting an increase in rating 
on the School Quality Snapshot, Supportive Environment Section, from "fair" to "good".

disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

 

Clear standards of conduct and expectations  

● The principal made strategic organizational decisions 
to identify and include a Director of Student Support 
Services who will lead the teacher team (PBIS 
Committee) in the creation, implementation, review, 
and revision of the initiative (PBIS). 
● The PBIS matrix, which outlines clear expectations 
for student conduct in conjunction with social 
emotional competencies. These expectations will be 
accessible, clear, age appropriate, and culturally 
consistent standards that will support desired 
behaviors during peer mediation and peace helper 
interactions.  
● Teacher lead committees will be reflective of the 
social emotional competencies. In addition these 
learning opportunities will work to develop a common 
language around and understanding of social-
emotional learning, thereby teachers will lead by 
example and model expectations..  

Monitoring of student social emotional growth 

● Staff will continue to strengthen their monitoring of 
student behavior utilizing the School-Wide PBIS matrix 
, which outlines clear expectations for student conduct 
in conjunction with social emotional competencies.  
● Students requiring support to follow expected 
parameters will receive an individualized behavior 
plan, which will be developed collaboratively from the 
various related constituents within the school.  
● Administrators will regularly monitor and provide 
actionable feedback to teachers in an effort to 
strengthen the culture of respect and rapport. 
● Engage personnel in reflective discussions of the 
indicators that demonstrate implementation of the 
competency, 2D of The Danielson Framework, while 
targeting desired effective outcomes for student 
growth.

Response to student social emotional needs 

● All personnel will continue to implement the 
outlined discipline responses in accordance with all the 
procedural requirements of Chancellor’s Regulation A-
443 in NYC’s City Wide Discipline Code and our school 
Discipline Protocols.  
● The Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) will  

collaborate on action plans and behavioral interventions to 
support Tier 2 and Tier 3 students. This includes 

● CIT members will follow outlined discipline protocols 
and model the supports to Tier 2 and Tier 3 students.  
● CIT members will provide professional development 
to the school community that will include case studies 
and role-playing.  
● CIT members will provide basic crisis training to 
school community.  
● CIT will monitor and revise the behavior plans of Tier 
2 and Tier 3 students to ensure that we maintain a 
culture of respect and rapport.  

Preventive action to embed peer mediation and peace helpers.  

 

September 2017, re-launch the Four R’s (Reading, Writing, 
Respect & Resolution) curriculum in Kindergarten through 
Grade 5. 

● By November 2017, peer mediators and peace 
helpers will support in resolving conflict for students 
who request a mediation. 

Reinforcement of positive behavior  

● Starbucks and PBIS Store – Students receive one 
Starbucks when recognized for behaviors seen on the 
PS 109 Behavior Matrix. Students are to put their name 
on the back and put it inside their individual baggie. 
The Starbuck is good to “purchase” item from the PBIS 
store.  
● Parent notification – parents will be regularly 
informed of their child’s behaviors as well how those 
behaviors impact learning in class. Teachers will record 
all parent interactions using the Parental Engagement 
Log. 
● Extracurricular Activities - PS 109X has expanded 
extracurricular activities through sports, performing 
arts, and visual arts, which align to our PBIS 
Framework. Students in 2nd-5th grades, who 
consistently exhibit compassion, integrity, and 
resiliency throughout the school day are invited to join 
extracurricular activities such as: The Basketball Team, 
Art Club, and Harlem Hip Hop Dance, or Disney 
Musical. In addition, as a school community, we 
showcase the arts program. Students in all grade levels 
are included in our school-wide Art Show and Seasonal 
Concerts, such as Harlem Hip Hop and our Theater

program These initiatives promote equity and 
collaboration among teachers. Furthermore, these 
activities serve as an incentive for our tier 2 and tier 3 
students to be reflective learners who are resilient 
members of our school community.  

 
Trust – this element of the Capacity Framework is essential to 
the success of this goal. The whole school community is 
involved in its success. Without showing value of each other, 
school staff, parents, students and administration will not 
move to more positive, focused behaviors. One strategy in 
place is the Weekly Message where the school administration 
highlights positive staff interactions and collaborations in the 
Celebrations section. Essential to this element of reciprocal 
trust is to hold each other accountable to the systems and 
protocols prescribed for the function of the school community.  

  
 
3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
There will be multiple opportunities for families to come into the school to develop their understanding of 
environment. Within the 2017-2018 school year, grade teams held workshops in both ELA and math to demonstrate 
different strategies in order for families to understand the curriculum their children are learning, ESL classes held 
workshops for Spanish-Speaking parents, the Art teachers held a show to display the Prek-5 work that has been done 
all year, Health fair and Cooking classes with Edible School Yard were presented to support healthier choices at home, 
and other workshops that are of high interest from families. As a result, we saw a slight increase in parental 
engagement and are constructing additional ways to stay more connected and open. For the upcoming school year, 
we will continue these programs and workshops to increase the support for children and families at home.  

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 

● Administration will need to make check ins to ensure the peer mediation protocols are implemented 
throughout the school to make the opportunity accessible to students in need of mediation. 
● Professional Learning sessions – times need to be built into PL calendar to allow for teacher development of 
strategies to support the success of this goal. 
● Teachers will need to work collaboratively during Common Planning to ensure common language and 
understanding of the pillars of social emotional growth.  
● Budget to accommodate the work of the Instructional coaches and consultants. 
● Instructional leaders, coaches, and network support will facilitate informed discussions on the implications of 
peer mediation and peace helpers. 
● Budget to accommodate rewards and incentives for students. 
* Time built into the Peer Mediator Coach schedule to support peer mediators during mediation sessions.

Our school's professional culture continues to improve as noted in the Quality Review 2016-2017 findings. Across 
classrooms, teaching practices are beginning to reflect beliefs about student learning as informed by the Danielson 
Framework for teaching and the instructional shifts. Some teachers provide multiple entry points to fully engage all 
students in appropriately challenging tasks. This inconsistent use of teaching strategies curtails engagement in higher 
order thinking skills and mastery attainment for students.  

The challenge PS 109 faces is the varying experience of our teaching staff which require a systematic approach to 
professional learning to ensure they are richly supported in their early years of teacher development.  

 

According to the Learning Environment Survey from 2016-17, 100% of teachers agree that teachers talk with one 
another about instruction. With 96% of teachers agreeing that teachers design instructional programs together and 94% 
agreeing that they make a conscious effort to coordinate their teaching with instruction at other grade levels. At the 
core of true collaboration is trust; teachers must be able to trust each other to openly share problems of practice and 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           27 

 

seek authentic support. 84% of the teachers trust each other, compared to the 16% of teachers who shared that they 
didn’t trust each other.  

 

However, based on this school year’s observations, teachers are having difficulty trusting each other based on their lack 
of collaborative practices outside of the structures administration has established for them to collaborate, such as 
common planning. As such teachers rely heavily on getting ideas and responses from administration to their questions 
and problems of practice, thus we are seeing a need to strengthen collegial relationships.  

 

We realize this takes time and patience but, with appropriate coaching and support, this will happen. A double block of 
common planning time is given to each grade team, including cluster teachers weekly and during that time, a grade 
leader is encouraged to guide the team through planning and reflection of the classroom program. Some grade leaders 
have been in their positions over a number of years, others are quite new to the role, and there is great variance in their 
skills. The result of this is great inconsistency between the grades and teachers often use the bulk of the time for 
administrative tasks rather than instruction.  
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal  

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 

By June 2019, through collaborative inquiry, teacher understanding of multiple entry points to fully engage all 
students in appropriately challenging tasks will result in an increase in student engagement as evidenced by a 
50% increase in the number of teachers receiving effective in 3C of the Danielson Rubric.

All teacher team meetings including common planning will have 
agendas grounded in the analyzing of student work, reflection, 
planning of instruction and sharing of best practices with the goal of 
improving instructional skill and student success.  
 

Grade team leaders will have professional learning opportunities for 
them to develop skills necessary in leadership. This may involve 
training provided by outside agencies or asking for support and 
mentoring from resources found within the school. 

 
Inquiry Cycles will run on 4 - 6 week cycles. Sessions will include a 
needs assessment, problem of practice along with complete action 
plans.  
 
Professional development will run on 2 week cycles following each 
inquiry cycle. Workshops will be led by administrators, school based 
coach as well as teachers. Teachers will sign up for professional 
development based on their areas of interest and need as per 
feedback from teacher leaders and administrators.  
 
Professional development will be offered to all teachers in reading 
and writing, inclusive of all components of balanced literacy 
approach, through the use of Teachers College staff developers, 
administrators, coaches, and all teachers.  
 
Professional development will be offered in regards to math

Tenet 2 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
2.2  The school leader ensures that the school community shares the Specific, Measurable, 

Ambitious, Results-oriented, and Timely (SMART) goals/mission and long-term vision inclusive 
of core values that address the priorities outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP). 
Leaders make strategic decisions to organize programmatic, human, and fiscal capital 
resources. 

2.3 

2.4  The school leader has a fully functional system in place aligned to the district's Annual 

Professional Performance Review (APPR) to conduct targeted and frequent observation and 
track progress of teacher practices based on student data and feedback. 

2.5  Leaders effectively use evidence-based systems and structures to examine and improve 

critical individual and school-wide practices as defined in the SCEP (student achievement, 
curriculum and teacher practices; leadership development; community/family engagement; 
and student social and emotional developmental health).

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

An area of celebration according to the QR feedback is the use of budget, space, coaches, partnerships and other 
organizational decisions that are aligned and support the school's instructional goals and long range action plans. 
Teachers need to be acutely aware of the different entry points of the students in every learning experience, and so, 
too, we as the administration need to be consistent in our support to the staff. One size does not fit all, therefore we 
need to know where our teachers are along the continuum of the Danielson Framework, what supports their needs, and 
then provide them with the necessary tools and strategies to grow them. With such a new teaching staff, along with a 
third of the teachers that have a wide range of experiences with different abilities and understandings, the challenge lies 
in the ability to find the entry point for their individualized support.  
The reason that acknowledging the strengths and remediating the weaknesses of teaching staff is so important is that 
student learning is at stake. The impact of the teacher on student achievement has been recognized in research studies, 
most recently highlighted again in John Hattie’s work where he extols teachers to “Know thy impact.” Therefore, 
strengthening teacher practices by using evidenced-based systems and structures we will be able to begin to examine 
and improve individual and school- wide critical practices.

At PS 109, our area of focus is to support the growth of all our staff, but this year to focus on developing those in 
leadership over the majority – any member in the community with leadership over a professional learning team, such as 
grade leaders, committee leaders, mentors, instructional coaches and model teachers, has the ability to support in the 
collaborative system of periodic check -ins, which will result in relevant feedback and relevant improvement plans by 
which the structure to regularly monitor all aspects of the school by leadership of the majority will result in decisions so 
that continuous improvement can be achieved.

planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
At our monthly leadership meetings, we will monitor implementation of feedback and professional development 
strategies in the classroom. Each participant will select an indicator of the framework in Domain 3 or 4. We will reflect 
on our learning and share areas of celebration and areas of growth for each indicator as we revise and adjust our 
approach to our feedback and professional development. At this meeting we will also self-assess our progress 
monitoring practices to: 

  How effective is the teaching and learning? 
  How well do teachers implement feedback, professional development and reflect on teaching? 
  We will revise and adjust our practices accordingly?

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Areas of Strength: 
 
After close analysis of the NYC School Survey, it is evident PS 109 has shown improvement in maintaining a strong 
family-community tie. After careful review of the most recent Learning Environment Survey, 94% of our parent 
community agree that the school leaders promote family and community involvement in the school. Additionally 
according to the survey, 93% of parents agree that they feel well-informed by the communications they receive. 
Examples of this outreach include a monthly newsletter, The Sedgwick News, which provides information to families 
regarding events and important dates at the school, but also activities within the community and district. As such, 
families are receiving information regarding school events in real time. Many more families are attending their children's 
writing and reading celebrations which occur at the end of units of study. Additionally, parental engagement workshops 
are held by grade teams throughout the year. The outreach is conducted by the teachers in which they send home flyers 
and remind students to invite their families. Other family events such as our Disney in the Schools show and kids 
basketball games are held throughout the year.

PS 109 has a partnership with the Morningside Center for Social Responsibility. This collaboration is between teachers 
and Morningside Staff, as well as parents and families Our Morningside consultant works closely with all stakeholders 
within the school community to ensure that there is a common language for students at home and in school. For each 
unit in the program, there is a corresponding home connection piece that is sent home to families so that they could 
learn more about the work we are doing within the school to support students. As a result, we experienced a decrease 
in infractions across the year.  
 
As per our focus for the 2016-2017 school year we held monthly opportunities for families to come to the school during 
the school day to see their child's classroom at work. They were able to see all subjects as well as the Morningside 
curriculum taking place in the classroom. The parents were then invited to a hands on workshop that allowed them to 
experience the work their child does in class. They were also able to walk away with tools to help their children succeed 
at home. According to the 2016-2017 NYC School Survey, 90% of parents agree they were invited to their child's teacher 
to observe instruction.  
 
Areas of Focus:  
 
We will continue to promote to parents to attend the monthly PA meetings to parents in our community. We will do this 
by promoting them on the schools social media page, handing out memos to students to give to parents as well as 
having parents hand out memos outside the school.  
 
We will continue to deepen the work around social-emotional learning through a stronger partnership with parents. We 
will provide more opportunities for parents to become involved in the social-emotional work within the school building 
through workshops and assemblies. These will be run by teachers and staff as well as staff from the Morningside Center 
for Social responsibility.  
 
  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and 
paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
The school aligns its school-wide professional development plan to the Danielson Framework for Teaching, academic 
needs of students and the  
 
New Teachers : Teachers with initial certificates and less than two years of full-time prior teaching experience will 
be mentored. New teachers will have been assigned a mentor to support them through the challenges of the first 
year. Both new teachers and mentors will receive professional development and feedback on various areas of need 
related to classroom practice. Teachers will meet with mentors to reflect on teaching practice and next steps.  
80 Minute PD: Inquiry teams consist of teachers meeting on grade and vertically to develop targeted instruction 
that follows a level of progression across and within grades in writing. Teams meet on Monday afternoons and 
discuss plans using student’s work and writing rubrics for units of study across the year.  
TCI Training - Paraprofessional was trained in conflict resolution for students. The purpose of the training was to 
support students and teachers with students that could have difficulties with behavior. The goal was for students 
to have an opportunity with scaffold support to be able to reintegrate back to the classroom at a base line level. 
Activities consisted of role-playing, and developing actionable plans that could be implemented when needed.  
Reading Rescue - Paraprofessionals were trained in Reading Rescue, to support/tutor students in first and second 
grade who would not otherwise reach grade level reading.  
Principal Training - Principal attends District 9 professional development and conferences on the areas of 
instruction as well as compliance. Principal also attends professional development related to curriculum and 
instruction designed specifically to keep abreast of the innovations and concerns pertaining to instruction and 
instructional management. Professional development includes assessment-based accountability to support both 
teachers and students. 
Outside support from Network staff and other consultants in key areas to support students and staff:  

● Instructional Mentor/Behavioral specialist for developing teachers- activities include one-one 
coaching/mentoring, Professional develop sessions based on data 
● Aussie Consultant- activities include one-one instructional coaching and lesson planning based on data 
and teacher’s needs. 
● Special Educational consultant- activities include lab sites and professional development to support ICT 
settings, development and implementation of IEPs and instructional support in classrooms through 
observations and feedback. 
● Consultants for content area support in both literacy and math- activities include one-one coaching, 
feedback and grade team professional development to meet instructional shifts, CCSS, and lesson planning 
around units of study and modules in mathematics.

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information, 
early intervention services, etc.). 
Kindergarten Readiness is a stage of transition that encompasses the child’s various learning experiences general 
knowledge, physical well being, social and emotional development, and familiarity and with language. Children 
develop at an individual rate. As a result, children enter school with varied levels of skill and learning experiences. This 
requires that we as a school need to be prepared to serve all children effectively regardless of a child’s individual 
developmental level. As we prepare students for the transition to Kindergarten we will: 
In April: Pre K teachers review and discuss a Kindergarten Readiness Checklist and transition with parents. 
In May: We encourage parents to schedule visits to kindergarten classes during a Kindergarten orientation. 
In June: Preschoolers visit receiving kindergarten classroom and meet the teacher during open house. 
Pre K and Kindergarten teachers meet to discuss students and their assessments.  
On going: Kindergarten and preschool teachers will communicate on an ongoing basis about students and curriculum.  
On going: Monitor the fidelity of implementation of instructional materials and methods through common planning 
and inquiry team sessions.  
 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
At the beginning of the year, teacher teams meet in common planning to determine the multiple assessment 
measures that will be used throughout the year and within different subject areas. Periodically, at the conclusion of 
each unit of study, teachers assess the measures that will be used the following unit and modify as needed  
Within common planning, faculty conferences and inquiry the administrative team facilitates professional 
development around how to disaggregate data, set goals and align coherent instruction to said data. Multiple 
measures of data are presented along with different methods that can be utilized to address the results of the data. 
Through classroom observations, administration monitors the use of assessment results and revises professional 
development to continue to meet the needs of the teachers.  
 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 109, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

PS 109 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement 
level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning 
and decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support 
and monitor their child’s progress; 
● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, 
and in languages that parents can understand; 
● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to 
improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between 
parents and other members of the school community;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of 
the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School 
Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their 
members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 
implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 
● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are 
allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting 
skills; 
● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 
strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, 
the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes 
providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership 
skills;  
● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, 
Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 
parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their 
right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 
1118 and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of 
the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations 
and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

P.S. 109 will be continuing its ongoing commitment to strengthen the academic proficiency of 
our English as a New Language Learners through The Title III After school Program. Many of 
our ENL Students will reap great academic benefit from the instruction provided by our certified 
English as a New Language teachers and other certified bilingual instructors who will be leading 
the program. Approximately 100 ENL Students will be selected to take part in the P.S. 109 Title 
III Supplemental After school Program.  The Program will target weaknesses in our students 
ability to recognize the appropriate academic language that is necessary to improve their reading 
and writing skills.   
The after school program will run from November 16, 2018 through March 16, 2019. The 
program will take place on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons from 2:40-3:40. This program 
will include 103 students from grades 1-5 and will consist of 30 sessions. The instruction will be 
provided by 10 teachers with ENL or bilingual certifications. 
 
Students identified in the EDAT data as at risk with three or more factors will be given higher 
priority in the participation of the after school program. Some of these specific factors are years 
of service/long-term ENL  learners, ELA and Math scores 1 or 2, regression of one or two 
proficiency levels and/or no progress on the NYSESLAT.  In addition to the EDAT data, we will 
be using the 2018 NYSESLAT scores to help determine our focus area and student groups. 
Students at the Entering-Emergence and intermediate levels of English proficiency will be 
chosen to participate.  This include 4 ENL students that  scored at or below 25th growth 
percentile and scored 1 or 2 on Math and ELA, 41 ENL students with 3 or more at-risk factors 
mentioned above and the 17 ENLs with 5 or 6 years of service.   
 
A close analysis of data reveals that our ENL students are struggling with academic reading and 
writing. Data indicates that 20 out of 25 students tested on 2nd grade scored low in writing 
modality and the same is reflected on grades three to five.   The lack of academic reading and 
writing skills hinders the ENL students progress in other content areas such as Math and 
Science.  So, it is imperative that these areas are targeted. 
 
 The focus of our Title III this school year will be Literacy.  Students will be grouped according 
to language level and modalities of need.  Explicit language instruction will develop reading 
concepts, build academic language and promote written and oral language skills. Students will 
receive grade appropriate instruction with scaffolds appropriate to their language level. Teachers 
in the after school program will use the SIOP model, forming a language objective directly 
connected to the content objective of the lesson. Each teacher will be working with one group to

provide two hours of instruction a week tailored to the language and skill needs of their learners. 
In order to provide these services teachers will be using high quality resources such as:   
 
The Leveled Literacy Program by Fountas and Pinnell will be used to facilitate guided reading. 
 
These resources will be used to provide remedial and literacy instruction to Entering, Emergent 
and Transitioning English as a New Language students in grades 1-5 to achieve three main 
objectives:  1) reinforce and help develop foundational reading skills, 2) provide instruction that 
supplements the ongoing learning in the student’s general classroom and 3) ensure that through 
our supplementary instruction ENL students are prepared to meet the Annual Measurable 
Achievement Objectives  (AMAO) in reading and writing and any other State Academic 
standards expected of all students in their respective level.

Data indicates that rigorous instruction is a major component in achieving students' 
success.  Since teachers play an important role in imparting our students with the quality 
instruction they need to succeed in the  21st century, providing teachers with on-going 
professional development is of the utmost importance. 
 
The P.S. 109 Title III  Professional Development  goal is to keep teachers abreast with new ENL 
methodologies, strategies and research-based approaches.  Therefore, as in previous years, Title 
III teachers will participate in technology training and school-based coaching provided by

educational institutions and in-house experts.  Teachers College continues to support our 
instructional program through regular monthly lab-sites, planning, classrooms inter-visitations, 
one-to-one coaching and workshops; all vital training that helps in equipping our teachers with 
the tools to understand how students learn and to implement strategies that effect change in 
raising students' achievements. 
 
Extended day Professional Development is offered every Monday afternoon to all classroom and 
cluster teachers who service our ENL students. Some of these professional development 
opportunities include---but are not limited to---training our teachers to use data to gear 
instruction and to present information and concepts in a comprehensive manner. Thus 
demonstrating how knowledge is contextualized  and applied across the different levels of 
English language acquisition, while also enhancing our teachers' ability to use curriculum 
learning standards. 
 
There will also be  extended day collaborative development meetings held on the first Monday of 
every month from 3-4 specifically for teachers participating in the Title III program. The 
meetings will be provided by the Assistant Principal, Rachel Adelstein, the Literacy Coach, 
Priscilla Roldan and the ENL team. These meetings provide our Title III teachers with the 
opportunity to develop effective language strategies that will assist them in meeting the special 
academic needs of our ENL students at no additional cost to the Title III Program. 
 
Original records of the professional staff development sessions (Agendas and attendance sheets ) 
will be maintained in the Main Office and copies will be filed  in the Title III binder in Room 
1000. 
  
 In addition to the following professional Learning Cycles, teachers will have the opportunity to

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
children's 
P.S. 109 recognizes that encouraging greater involvement at school from all students' families 
may be an important strategy for addressing the achievement gap between high-literacy and low-
literacy families.  It is a fact that when schools support parent involvement at home and schools, 
students make greater progress.  For these reasons, as in previous years, P.S. 109 will allocate 
funds  to provide family literacy instructions, parent outreach and training activities to 
help  parents become more active participants in their children's education. 
 
Based on the community needs, we are offering the parents of our ENL students the tools and 
strategies needed on supporting their children social and academic language acquisition.  Below 
is a list of dates and topics for a series of parent workshops run by the ENL Team and Parent 
Coordinator Lashonna Cooper.  It is our goal to engage the community in the education of our 
ENL population.Tentative parent workshops topics and dates:

The 10% money allocation for parental involvement will be used to provide parents with 
refreshments and supply materials needed for workshop activities and Adult English as a New 
Language classes.Parents will be encouraged to become parent volunteers.  The school primary 
emphasis is to give the parents of our ENL students the opportunity to be involved in their child's 
educational growth outside the regular school day and to see some of the enriching things their 
child is learning. 
 
In an effort to further develop partnerships with parents and keep them involved in the school 
community, P.S. 109 will offer parents ENL Adult classes.  The classes will be taught by the 
bilingual certified teacher, Yanira Burgos.  ENL Adult classes will be held every Friday from 
3:15-5:15 p.m.  as of November 4, 2016 until May 12, 2017.  The ENL Adult classes will consist 
of  24 sessions.  The information for the ENL Adult program as well as the series of parental 
workshops will be disseminated to the school community through flyers and monthly calendars 
in the parents preferred language.   
 
Records of Parents Workshop and Adult ENL classes (Agendas, attendance, Notification Letters 
and Calendars) will be maintained in the Title III School Binder in Room 1000. 
 
In terms of oral interpretation, one of the commitments of our school is to communicate with 
parents in the language of their choice and to improve positive communication.  Based on the 
fact that 79 percent of the 719 student population of our school comes from Hispanic families 
and that 26.1 percent are English Language Learners, there is clearly a high need for written 
translation and oral interpretation of the Spanish language.  The other percentage of our largely 
African immigrant population is English dominant.  Therefore, the school provides written 
translation and oral interpretation in Spanish.  When necessary, all correspondence is translated 
in other languages via the DOE translation services.  School monthly calendars, flyers, 
permission slips and other important documents are translated in Spanish to ensure all parents are 
informed of the events of our school community.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
 The Community Coordinator and  ENL Team work together to provide oral translations at 
workshops and assemblies. P.S. 109 is fortunate to have many staff and administrators who can 
speak Spanish and English to facilitate strong communication between home and 
school.                
In addition, Bilingual Staff will now offer parent meetings every Tuesdays during Parental 
Engagement throughout the year to discuss their children's progress and the goals we have for 
our students, as well as what they can do to help support these language goals.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
As an effective formative assessment practice for ELL students at P.S.109, the ENL providers maintain 
student’s portfolios consisting of samples within the five components of English acquisition to show and celebrate individual 
student growth over time. Through portfolios, student work becomes the centerpiece of conferences and collaborative 
meetings with classroom teachers and ENL teachers. As a systematic formative measure student portfolios are intended to 
focus on feedback for the teacher, student and ENL provider as well as parents.

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

As a critical step in strengthening ELL formative assessments P.S.109 has created and sustain collaborative time to analyze 
student work. Evidence-based conversations between educators about what students are producing directly lead the ENL 
Teacher and class room teacher towards ideas for effective student feedback and instruction. As a professional learning 
communities P.S.109 also provides opportunities for collaboration with ELL specialists to deepen content teachers’ 
understanding of language and literacy. Together we consider building data walls of multiple measures of ELL data quarterly to 
facilitate data-driven coaching cycles and team planning. In these ways, we can offer a “photo album” approach to show 
progress over time, celebrating students’ journey of academic language development. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 As a baseline assessment the ELL program uses the NYSITELL for incoming students and the Spanish LAB if needed, to assess 
students’ knowledge of English language acquisition. These assessments help support our ELLS as well as classroom teachers in 
providing data base on students’ needs within NYS Common Core Learning Standard (CCLS) and the New York State Bilingual 
Common Core Initiative (NLAP). The Progressions include five levels of language proficiency and demonstrate a trajectory of 
language learning and teaching. As a baseline assessment the ELL program determines students’ placement under the five 
levels of English language acquisition competencies (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding). 
The NYSESLAT is used as a benchmark assessment to indicate the progress of ELL students within the school year, targeting the 
five components of English acquisition (speaking, listening, reading, writing and grammar). Affording the Certified ENL as well 
as classroom teacher to view student’s growth and plan for next steps for instruction in the upcoming year. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We conduct small group instructions  to address the five components of the Language  (speaking, listening, reading, writing 
and grammar, during integrated instructional time  focusing on content areas of the school curriculum, as well as during stand 
alone targeting the individual students needs based on differentiation instruction according to the students reading levels and 
according to their English Proficiency Levels.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Data of ELL’s linguistic, cultural and experiential background screening is utilized to monitor, set goals and help promote 
English literacy within the Response to Intervention (RTI) Framework. The school uses this information to equip teachers with 
knowledge of improving assessment, resources and support to implement RTI effectively. Teachers work collaboratively with 
other colleagues to monitor these procedures and improve students’ outcomes.  The data-driven instruction used by teachers 
from formative assessment is used to make revisions of lessons and units for Tier 1.  Students in need of Tier 2 instruction are 
provided with Wilson intervention by AIS service providers.  At Tier 3, specialized assessments are used to evaluate and 
identify possible learning disabilities before recommendation to special education services are initiated. 
  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data for students who scored at an entering level on the NYSITELL in lower grades revealed a steady progress in 
phonological awareness and language acquisition.  However, the majority of students in the lower grades who scored at an 
Expanding level either stayed on the same level or digressed to a transitioning or emerging level. The data for the students in 
grades 3 to 5 revealed that language learners are struggling with making meaning of texts and using literary strategies for 
literal analysis and evaluation.  They also need further academic language exposure and idiomatic language.      
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The instruction in the Freestanding English as a New Language Program is provided via self-contained classes.  The 
instruction will continue to be interdisciplinary and address all content areas. A certified ENL teacher will service our 
identified group of ELLs in grades K-5.  The opted out students in each of the grade levels will be grouped by levels 
within their self-contained classes and a licensed ENL provider will push-in to support the English Language Learners 
during guided reading instruction and/or content area to support academic development and comprehension.  The 
ESL instruction will highlight the reading, writing, listening and speaking modalities.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not applicable, TBE program is not offered at the school. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

The Dual Language at P.S. 109 primary language acquisition goal is the development of grade-level appropriate 
bilingual and biliterate academic skills in both English and the target language (Spanish) for all students.  The Dual 
Language Program uses a side-by-side model in grades pre-k through first in which language use for content areas 
alternates from day to day.  Students in Pre-K and K learn to read and write in their native language(75/25) and 
receive instruction in other discipline in the new language. In grades 1 through 5 students learn to read and write  in 
both languages (50/50).      

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

To ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is delivered in the ENL program model we provide a combination of 
integrated and stand-alone ENL instruction provided by a certified ENL pedagogue.  The ENL providers push-in to work with 
the ELL students grouped by their English levels during ELA and content area instruction. Thus making certain that students at 
their different level receive their mandated minutes of instruction as per CR Part 154.  
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The Dual Language Program content area instruction in Math, Science and Social Studies will be provided in both English as a 
New Language and the native target language (Spanish) in order to build literacy skills with an emphasis on content specific 
vocabulary.  The Bilingual classroom teacher will provide the mandated minutes of stand alone ENL, integrated and HLA 
minutes to the students in the program. Content area teachers will align their program (Science, Social Studies, Math) with the 
goals and objectives of the Dual Language Program. Classroom teachers will increase the use of non-fiction literature during 
shared reading, guided reading and individual reading workshops in order to build content-specific language and vocabulary. 
Writing will be incorporated in all content area lessons each day in both the ENL and the target language (Spanish). 
  
The Free Standing ESL content area instruction similarly as the Dual Language content area instruction will continue to be 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62 

 

interdisciplinary and address all content areas.  The ESL instruction will target the modalities of reading and writing and will be 
aligned to the uniform curriculum. Push-in ESl teachers will systematically support content area instruction in English aimed at 
building academic language as well as oral and written language skills. Cluster teachers providing content instruction will use 
ESL methods that increase students exposure to content-specific vocabulary, differentiated content lessons and opportunities 
to develop their ENL skills. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

 We ensure that ELLs who first language is Spanish are appropriately evaluated in their home native language; initially by 
administering the Spanish LAB and throughout the year with the TCRWP in Spanish and the DRA. Home language support is 
always provided via bilingual pedagogues, leveled books, peer-partners and content glossaries and dictionaries.      
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a.     SIFE-Students classified in this category are at a disadvantage to their peers since they lack the literacy foundational skills 
that their peers possess in their native language. These students need to learn the basics in order to create a foundation for 
their learning. Since SIFE lack their foundation in their native language, our plan is to instruct them in English as a new 
language using their native language for instructional support. The initial phase of our plan include letter identification and 
letter sound recognition, and phonemic awareness. 
  
b.     Newcomer ELLs in grades K-5 instruction will highlight oral language development. As being able to talk and express your 
thoughts clearly is vital in life and students at this stage lack the ability to communicate in ENL, emphasis will be placed on 
listening comprehension activities that incorporate read alouds,  having students point to pictures or act out vocabulary, 
developing survival language by saying and showing the meaning of vocabulary words and reinforcing learning by modeling. 
  
c.      Developing ELLs instruction will emphasize lexical grammar, structure awareness, and the five components of the 
language: reading, writing, listening and speaking and grammar. 
  
d.     Long Term ELLs receive integrated instruction by both an ENL teacher and a common-branch teacher using the Rigby and 
National Geography Programs to supplement the core curriculum and improve academic vocabulary.  long term ELLs also 
participate in small group instruction, are invited to the Title III Early Literacy Program, After School Program and Saturday 
Academy. 
  
e.      Former ELLs are provided with integrated ENL instruction for 90 minutes per week.  
   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers of ELL-SWD use: effective-research based strategies to teach reading skills while supporting ELL's second-language, 
differentiated instruction that provides intervention for students exhibiting reading difficulties, and strategies that addresses 
ELL students' unique literacy learning needs using the students' native language to support the development of literacy skills in 
the second language. The materials used to provide intervention and instruct students with disabilities are of high interest, 
age-appropriate and conducive to meeting the demands of the Common Core Curriculum. Such as the Engage NY Mathematics 
that addresses different learning modalities by using a hands-on, visual and then moving into abstract approach in the teaching 
of mathematics concepts. The Rigby Program is also a program design to develop language and literacy skills while providing 
multiple entry points and scaffolds to foster comprehension, academic vocabulary and literacy skills.

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
  
To enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency, the school: provides small group instruction, uses 
integrated teaching with the classroom and the ENL teacher, and uses targeted tier 2 and tier 3 interventions.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
For our newcomer ELL subgroup in grades 3-5, we use the ELL Rigby Program  to support students comprehension of non-
fiction complex text.   WILSON intervention is used by an AIS provider to provide additional support in building student 
phonological awareness and fluency.  In grades K-2, we also use the ELL Rigby Program to develop acquisition of early literacy 
skills.   Additional support is provided to students in small, shared reading and guided groups.  Teachers use teacher-created 
intervention materials in addition to supplemental resources from the core curriculum to assess students literacy skills.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

To improve the ELL program, we anticipate using a variety of program and interventions to supplement the core 
curriculum.  The programs are aligned to the themes in the core curriculum to provide additional support, exposure and 
practice of academic language.  We have also supplemented the independent, shared and guided reading program with 
culturally responsive trade.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

None 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs at P.S. 109 are invited to participate in all programs, services and activities as the rest of the school population.  Ells are 
invited to participate in the Disney Musical Show, Basketball Games, Science Fairs, Art Shows, Movie Nights, and Health 
Fairs.  Ells also participate in Title III math and literacy After-school Programs and Saturday Academy .  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We currently use the Read-A-Z, Imagine Learning and Read 180  Programs to provide supplemental instructional support and 
ensure that teachers are implementing the program with fidelity.  Programs geared to provide individualized instruction while 
developing literacy and language. We also use  the NTN math program and Engage New York  which requires the use of smart 
boards to enhance math content through visual and videos.    To further enhance instruction, teachers across grade-levels use 
SMART boards technology to build background knowledge, provide visual support and engage students. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is always provided in the ENL program, through the use of bilingual glossaries and 
dictionaries,leveled- books in the home language, computer programs such as Read A-Z with home language component and 
when possible, oral translation by either a "buddy" student or the teacher.   Teachers also use cognates in the content areas to 
value the home language as an asset for instruction.  Translanguaging techniques are also embedded in daily lessons to bridge 
student learning. 
GO Math is also available in the home language in addition to translated resources from Engage NY 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

P.S. 109 will continue to provide bilingual and ENL teachers with literature books that will support reading comprehension at 
different levels.  Bilingual classes will utilize grade appropriate literature in alignment with the Teachers College Curriculum 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64 

 

 

Units of Study.  Each ESL class will use the English Language Learners Instructional Programs Imagine Learning and RAZ.  These 
programs incorporate activities that promote reading and language proficiency.  The Imagine Learning Program has lessons 
that integrate listening, speaking, reading and writing as well as home language component in the students' native 
language.  The program also creates a student profile identifying students' deficiencies in each language modality. 
The ENL coordinator works closely with the support service providers to ensure that ELL students receive appropriate and 
research-based instructional services and interventions.    
  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
NA 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
P.S. 109 is not currently offering any activities before the beginning of the school year for newly enrolled ELLs or for ELLs who 
enroll throughout the school year.  However, the school future goal is to create and offer activities that will enable newly 
enrolled ELLs to integrate smoothly into the school system. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

 N/A    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

a.  109 public school dual language program initially uses two parallel classes in grades pre-kindergarten 
to one.  In grades 2-5 parallel classes are integrated and a certified bilingual teacher imparts 
instruction.  The home language of the students is used to impart literacy instruction 75 percent of the 
time initially in Pre-k and Kindergarten.  The other 25 percent is used for teaching in the new language. In 
grade one as well as in grades 3-5, instruction is 50 percent in English and 50 percent in the target 
language (Spanish).   
 b.  The subjects taught using the new language are math, social studies, science and other content areas.  
 c.  Language is separated for instruction in grades Pre-K-1 by switching classes every day during content 
area.  In grades 2-5 an alternating day program model is used. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
At P.S. 109x, we provide all ESL, monolingual, and support staff such as: paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, psychologists, 
occupational/physical therapists, speech teachers, secretaries, and parent coordinator with ongoing opportunities to attend 
both on-site and off-site workshops which reflect current theory based learning practices used for ESL instruction.  Providing

teachers with effective learning opportunities is the key to increasing student performance. As a result of these workshops, 
teachers have adopted many of the learning models that support achievement for our ELL population. They are encouraged to 
work collaboratively in professional learning teams to  revise lessons and units of study.  Grade conferences, Vertical and 
Horizontal meetings keep staff members abreast of ongoing changes in the Language Allocation Policy document.   These 
workshops are provided by our principal, assistant principal, team leaders, ELA and MATH staff developers, coaches, ELL 
specialists, and Literacy Support consultants.  Some topics that will be addresses are: Overview of the ESL Program , LAP 
document, Use of assessments for the ELLs, Data Driven Instruction (NYSESLAT), Writer's Workshop, NYSESLAT and NYISTELL, 
Common Core State Standards.   In addition, during our Title III program, we offer workshops to parents.  Some topics could 
be, but are not limited to  Testing Accommodations for ELLs, How to Help Your Child be Successful on State tests, and 
Identifying your child as an ELL and placing your student into a program of your choice.        
  
Professional Development is provided to all staff keeping them abreast of changes CR-PART 154 state regulations for the 
ELLs.  During the month of June, teachers and administrators meet to discuss the incoming students and how they can 
collaborate to ease the children's transition from one grade to another.  They meet to discuss placement, special needs and 
status of any evaluation that is pending.   
    
Teachers will also have the opportunity to attend workshops such as: Q-Tel, NYSABE, professional learning opportunities 
offered by DELLSS and through the Fordham R-BERN.  All teachers attending workshops will keep an ongoing log of the hours, 
certificates of attendance, professional development summaries are responsible to turn-key the information/resources shared 
during weekly meetings with their professional learning teams..   
  
  
CKLA workshops

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
As of this moment, the school is not offering any activities before the beginning of the school year for new ELLs who enroll 
before the beginning of the school year and for new ELLs that enroll throughout the year.  However, the school future goal is 
to be able to create and offer activities that will enable new enroll ELLs to smoothly transition into the school system.  
Teachers participate every Monday and throughout the school year in high quality professional development provided by the 
coaches, administrators, and master teachers .  Other professional learning opportunities are offered in and out of school by 
Teachers College  Fordham University (R-BERN) and other .  Certificates of participation and copies of the professional learning 
agendas are stored in a central location.

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The school provides frequent individual meetings  during Family Engagement time with parents of ELLs to keep them informed 
of the ELLs program goals, results on language proficiency assessments and  language development of their children.  

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.

to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Parents enrolling their children in our school must complete the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) form. 
This provides the school of the child's a home language. In addition, the home language is also noted on the 
Elementary School Cumulative Record Card, the parents must inform the school of the languages spoken at home. 
Based on this information the school maintains an appropriate record of the primary language of each parent. 
This information is also entered in the ATS and on the student's emergency card. Parents are also given the 
Federal Parent/Guardian Student Ethnic and Race Identification form to identify their ethnic background.   In the 
even that a parent requires support in a language not spoken by school personnel, the Translation & 
Interpretation Unit is contacted.
