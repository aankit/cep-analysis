Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

P.S. 220’s Mission Statement is “Today’s Learner is Tomorrow’s Leader”. School is preparation not only for a career, 
but also for many facets of citizenship. Therefore, it is our obligation to ensure that our students are prepared to be 
productive citizens and tomorrow’s leaders. This vision is incorporated through all the collaborative work, 
professional learning and ongoing initiatives we embrace at P.S. 220.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

A key focus for our work for the 2018-2019 school year include data that has been compiled from our Advance overall 
Teacher Data which reflects 60% of Highly Effective Teachers and 40% Effective Teachers. Our data specific to 1a ( 
Demonstrating Knowledge of Content and Pedagogy) reflects 42% of our teachers are Highly Effective, 58% of our 
teachers are effective.  

P.S. 220's 2017-2018 PPO indicates highly effective or effective in the indicators 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 3.1, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, and 5.1. 
Our area of focus is 1.2, research based, effective instruction that yields high quality work (1.2) and structures for a 
positive learning environment, inclusive culture, and student success (4.1)  

 

At P.S. 220, we have established a partnership with families to support students’ progress towards college and career 
readiness. During Tuesday Parents engagement time, teachers work with parents to provide workshops on a variety 
of topics that strengthen families ability to support their children. Time is also used to communicate next steps and 
actions plans for individual students. Our school distributes a school wide Progress Report in January, which is an 
outgrowth of conversation with our School Leadership Team, in order to provide our parents with addition 
information regarding their child’s progress. Partnerships with community organizations include The Central Queens 
Y, Costco Tutoring, Cultural After School Adventures Program (CASA), Boy Scouts, Mighty Milers, Green Beatz, Grow 
to Learn, Historical Society, and Community Word Project. P.S. 220 maintains a Basketball Team coached by two of 
our teachers. P.S. 220 has a Step Team and a Gardening Club. We have multiple online resources to support our 
students such as Math Imagine Learning for all students and Reading Imagine Learning for our ENL students, myON 
on-line reading program, Mathletics on-line math program. 

 

At P.S. 220 we take pride in our school initiatives and that 100% of our school community is engaged in Teacher 
Teams in order to provide opportunities for teachers to participate in professional growth and share best practices. 
Inquiry Teams are established where teachers analyze student data leading to increased teacher practice and 
students performance. These teams include grade-wide and school-wide collaborations and use the Data Wise 
Process and protocols for looking at student work. In addition, the staff is able to review work in relation to expected 
outcomes in order to make decisions regarding next steps for planning and instruction to impact student outcomes. 
Book Club Teams are based on interest, in order to grow and develop professionally. 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

 

 

As of September 2018, our school consists of 703 students, which includes 332 female (49.6%) and 338 (50.4%) male. 
94% (659) of these students are in a General Education Setting. 6% (42) are in a least restrictive environment and 1% 
(7) is in the most restrictive environment. On each grade level, Kindergarten through 5th Grade, there is one ICT class. 
In addition, Gifted and Talented classes ranging from Kindergarten up to 5th Grade. At P.S. 220, 23% of our students 
(160) are ENL Learners. This range is from Grades K through Grade 5. 18% of our ENLs are Entering, 14% are Emerging. 
Based on our the data, one factor which impacts students learning is the fact that many of our ENL Students return to 
their native country during the school year. Additionally, most Entering and Emerging ENLs in the lower grades (K-2) 
have minimal literacy skills in their native language. These students enter the school system at an older age in their 
home country. Another factor which impacts their learning is the time needed to adapt to their new school 
environment, community and culture.

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

From 2016-2017 to 2017-2018 school year, our data indicates progress under Strong Family-Community Ties with an 
increase of .12. Data indicates a decline in Trust with a .43 decrease and Effective School Leadership with a decrease 
of .34.

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
On the 2017-2018 School Survey, PS 220 scored a 4.00 under Rigorous instruction. The survey also indicates a 67% 
positive response under Quality Discussion. More specifically, 61% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the 
students in their classes build on each others ideas during class discussion and 53% of teachers responded that a lot 
or all of the students in their classes use data or text references to support their ideas. In addition, the survey 
indicates a 72% under Academic Press. More specifically, 56% of teachers say that students respond to challenging 
questions in class and 63% of teachers say that students respond to challenging test questions. 

 

P.S. 220's 2017-2018 PPO data indicates an indicates an area of focus is 1.2, research based, effective instruction that 
yields high quality work. 

Our in-house Math benchmark data indicates in June 2017, 45% of our students, in Grades 3-5, were working on or 
above grade level and in June 2018, 65% of our students, in Grades 3-5, were working on or above grade level.

Teachers teams such as the Professional Development Committee, MOSL committee and literacy committee help 
provide feedback to our core cabinet team regarding the professional development needs of our staff. In addition, 
staff members take a professional development survey which is used to develop school-wide as well as differentiated 
professional development aligned to staff needs. Our multiple assessment measures are shared with the MOSL 
committee who then collaborates with staff members assigned to their specific grades. The information is then 
brought back to our core MOSL team where they are discussed and shared creating a plan that supports student 
growth. Utilization of Survey Monkey, exit slips and teacher meetings are systems we have in place. Professional 
Development is focused on the results of formal and informal assessments. A focus on learning gaps, looking at trends 
throughout the grades, strategies for instruction to support identified areas that require support will be addressed. 
Teachers will review on an ongoing basis the N.Y.S. ELA and Math item analyses, in-house benchmarks as well as 
student work and assessments. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 220Q , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;

Rationale:  
 To develop our program we have collected and analyzed data from the "EDAT", NYSITELL, 
NYSESLAT, ELA and Math exams as well as TCRWP.  Based upon this data we selected ELL 
students ranging from grades one through five including entering, emerging, transitioning and 
expanding proficiency levels. The rationale for this selection supports ELL students as they 
continue to progress through the proficiency levels.  Instruction will be delivered in English.  In 
order to ensure progress for our ELL students, instruction will include a successful researched 
based multi-sensory approach for English-Language Development. All records related to our 
Title III Program will be maintained in a binder, located in the Assistant Principal's office. To 
accommodate ELLs and their families, translators and the Translation Interpretation Unit will be 
utilized to support the program. A binder will be available in the assistant principals office 
indicating student attendance, program notification and the preferred languages of our school 
community.  Translators will be utilized to support the program as well as the translation 
interpretation unit.

ENL team to acquire strategies essential for scaffolding learning. Teachers have experiences and 
daily interactions with ELL students in their classrooms where they implement these strategies. 
The expertise of the general education teachers along with the expertise of the ENL teacher 
solidifies the English language instruction through content learning.  All teachers provide 
equitable instruction and rigorous across all content areas to meet the academic language of all 
students. 
 Overseeing the program, our supervisor shall perform administrative duties as well as 
supervising coherent and rigorous instruction aligned to the Common Core Professional 
Standards and supporting professional learning. Instruction will adhere to the Common Core 
Learning Standards for writing, reading informational text, reading literature and language 
standards. Teachers will implement the New Language Arts Progressions and Home Language 
Arts Progressions from The New York State Bilingual Common Core Initiative. The ENL 
teacher along with general education teachers will employ scaffolding strategies that unpacks the 
academic language found in informational reading and content area learning.  
Types of materials: 
We will utilize National Geographic Kids Readers, Scholastic Science Vocabulary Readers, 
Benchmark Education English Explorers materials which include audio CD's and leveled books 
which encompass sentence structures, language development, reading strategies, content 
vocabulary, high frequency words, fluency and text and graphic features for Science and Social 
Studies content. We will employ Reader's Theater , MYON and Mathletics to strengthen 
students' listening, reading, writing and speaking and academic skills. Additionally, we will also 
be using Nursery Rhymes on CD to promote phonemic awareness.  
For Language Arts, we will align our instruction with the Teachers College Reading and Writing 
Project. Our ELL students  will engage in reading a wide variety of nonfiction books which 
reflect complex texts in content areas. The Scholastic Reading Skills Leveled Kits differentiate 
across proficiency levels so that all students will learn necessary reading strategies in order to 
become skilled readers and subsequently achieve success as writers as well. These resources 
provide high interest topics that are aligned with content area curriculum. They focus on topics in 
social studies, science, mathematics, technology, sports, arts and entertainment. To build upon 
background knowledge prior to the visit to the Hall of Science, we will utilize the Amplify 
Science Program.  Students will have the opportunity to research high interest science focus 
groups.  Students will create projects based on their research which will be presented to parents 
prior to the visit.  This will help to build a framework for navigating through STEM 
education.  Additional resources are listed below:

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
laptops will maximize access to the curriculum promoting student engagement and participation 
in all learning activities. Also, these tools will allow teachers to supplement and reinforce 
planning and the presentation of lessons. A focus on instructional conversation to support higher 
order questioning will initiate academic discourse among students thus strengthening language 
acquisition in all modalities of communication.  
To develop ELL students' content skills, such as, math, science and social studies, we will 
construct our lessons by infusing the academic language that our ELLs encounter during their 
daily lessons.  Student will learn to utilize, online translation software, picture dictionaries, 
online bilingual and English dictionaries, and hardcover dictionaries.  In order to ensure progress 
for our ELLs, instruction will include a successful research based multi-sensory approach for 
English language development to equitably participate in the 21st century. Our ELL students 
have access to MAC notebooks, and therefore given multiple opportunities to engage in 
researching a variety of content areas and use of all modalities for acquiring English language 
proficiency. 
By tapping into students’ prior knowledge and building background knowledge of a subject, we 
will bridge new concepts so ELL students can progress through cognitive processes from 
recalling, understanding and applying information, to making analyses and evaluations of 
various situations, and to creating a variety of products in unique and original ways.  We will 
contextualize new concepts and language by using realia, manipulatives, graphic representation, 
technology and verbal analogies familiar to students. 
Teachers will use schema building by helping students weave new information into pre-existing 
structures of meaning. Through text re-presentation students will transfer skills and recreate 
concepts and display language across genres. We will ensure that our ELL students apply 
metacognitive strategies by using self monitoring checklists, student assessment charts and 
rubrics and the Reading Learning Progressions. Students will have the opportunity to create 
projects based on their research and class work  representing their new and reinforced learning in 
science and other STEM concepts and content area knowledge. 
The aforementioned above strategies and methods are part of the school's core belief of 
providing multiple entry points for English Language Learners as they continue to strive for 
success in school and further up the higher educational ladder through college and career 
readiness.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
  Parents of students in grades 1-5 will be invited to participate in workshops  presented in 
partnership with our ENL Team and  parent coordinator. 
  
 Our goal for our Saturday Program is to offer community support to the ENL families and 
develop an awareness of cross cultural differences between their native home and their new 
home. Also, in order to help families support their children in content areas our theme this year 
for our Saturday Program is "Navigating our way through STEM Education”.  To support this 
theme we will invite parents of students attending the Title III Program to participate in a visit to 
the Hall of Science.   The framework will provide parents with the tools they need to participate 
actively in our inter-generational visit to the Hall of Science with their children.   
 
1)  During our Saturday workshop for Newcomers and their families, parents will be introduced 
to STEM education.   In addition, parents will research and explore useful websites and books to 
help navigate their children through content area subjects.   
One ENL teacher, Mrs. Torres, Mrs. Valerio, one translator, the supervisor of the program will 
participate. 
Date:  Saturday, November 17, 2018:  8:30 am - 12:30 pm 
2)  Additionally, we will host a family Stem day for ENL students grades 1 -5.  ENL students 
and their families will be invited to participate in a variety of STEM activities. The program will 
support academic success for ELLs as they discover the language associated with STEM. 
Two ENL teachers, Mrs. Torres, Mrs. Valerio, translators and one general education teacher will 
participate. 
Date:  Saturday, March 2, 2019:  8:30 am  - 12:30 pm 
3)  Inter-generational visit to the Hall of Science.  ENL students and families will be invited to 
experience this cultural venue offered in our Queens community. We will visit New York's 
center for informal interactive hands-on learning to STEM education. 
We will invite our newcomers ( 20 students and parents), One ENL teacher, Mrs. Torres, Mrs. 
Valerio and the supervisor of the program will participate. 
Date:  Saturday, May 11, 2019:  8:30 am - 1:30 pm 
 
Our parent coordinator as well as the assistant principal will maintain agendas and records that 
reflect workshops, attendance and invitations in preferred languages. Records will be maintained 
in a binder in the assistant principals office as well a with the parent coordinator. 
  To inform parents of all activities that our Title III program has to offer, translated letters in 
their native language will be sent home. All records for our Saturday program will maintain in a 
binder located in our Assistant Principal's office. Our goal for our Title III Parent ENL Program 
is to offer community support to the ENL families and develop an awareness of cross cultural 
differences between their native home and their new home.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, [PRINCIPAL's NAME], testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Articulation was conducted with the school leadership team, classroom teachers, ENL teacher and parent 
coordinator to determine the needs of our non English speaking families. Using the Home Language Surveys, 
collected information was analyzed in an effort to further clarify the level of translation support needed and 
languages most dominant at PS 220. In addition the Parent Coordinator works closely with families and conducts 
informal surveys involving classroom teachers. This helps us identify the oral interpretation needs of our school 
community. While reviewing our data we noticed a significant similarity between parents who need oral 
interpretation and those who need written interpretation of school documents. Of the children serviced in ENL, 
the majority of the families are Uzbek speaking. In addition, we have an increase in our school community of 
Hispanic, Chinese and Arabic families. Our overall school community shows a need for Russian, Spanish and 
Chinese. Our overall population has requested the following written and oral language translations within our 
school community as per our current ATS RCPL majority: English 57% Russian 21%, Spanish 10%, Bengali 4%, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

Chinese 2%, Uzbek 4%, Arabic 1%, other 1%. According to our ENL population parents requested the following 
language translations: Russian 21%, Spanish 10%, Bengali 4%, Chinese 2%, Uzbek 4%, Arabic 1%, other 1%.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

The first week in September, our Language Access Coordinator will host professional learning and will provide all staff 
members with a list of all Bilingual Staff and Bilingual Parent Volunteers names and phone numbers. Additionally, all 
teachers will be provided with directions to set up their REMIND accounts and the phone number to the Translation 
and Interpretation. All information will be also emailed to all staff members. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Parents are provided with translations, of covered languages, of the Bill of Rights and Responsibilities regarding the 
translation and 

interpretation services. Signs and notices are posted in covered languages in conspicuous locations such as the main 
entrance and "I Speak" cards are available in the main office informing parents that translation and interpretation 
services are available. The school will keep an updated list of limited English/non-English speaking parents based on 
the Home Language Identification Survey. A list of teachers/staff members and corresponding non-English languages 
of proficiency has been created and staff are made accessible should the need for an interpreter/translator arise. In 
addition, the Pupil Personnel Secretary and the classroom teacher will indicate on the child's blue emergency card 
that the child's parents have limited English proficiency. Finally, all personnel who provide instruction and service to a 
student whose parents are limited English/non-English speakers will be given access to Section VII of Chancellor's 
Regulations A-663 and links to translated documents and correspondence available in the DOE and NYSED website to 
ensure parental notification requirements and interpretation services are satisfied.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Each year we review our parent survey to review parent feedback on what forms of communication are preferred. 
The parent coordinator schedules quarterly meetings with parents with diverse culture and languages to gather 
feedback and best practices that can be utilized by the school to ensure services are delivered to ELL's more 
effectively.
