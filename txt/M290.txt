Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission Statement  

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

At P.S. 290 The Manhattan New School, we envision a school where all members of our community are self-
motivated, self reflective and self-aware. Challenges and mistakes are viewed as opportunities for growth and 
learning. Fixed mindsets are replaced with growth mindsets and phrases such as “I can’t” and “I’m not good at” are 
replaced with “I need some help with” or I’m working on improving at” and “I’m not there yet”. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Social and emotional learning is incorporated into the curriculum in an authentic and meaningful way. All 
stakeholders value the importance of emotional intelligence. The staff models behaviors that reinforce positive social 
interactions, we value our role as facilitators and role models. Teachers feel responsible for all students in the school, 
not just those in their classrooms. Relationships are built between students and adults, each child is an individual and 
recognized for their unique qualities and characteristics. 
Teachers have high expectations of all their students and in turn the students have high expectations of themselves. 
Each classroom curricula is rigorous, meets the standards, is differentiated and modified to meet the needs of all 
students. Students explore, question and collaborate in order to become life long learners and global citizens. 
Children are aware of their strengths and goals, which are determined in partnership between the students and 
teachers in a purposeful manner. Students feel empowered to state their opinions, question each other and articulate 
thoughts and ideas through actionable feedback. 
Administrators have a high level of respect for the professionals in the building. Teachers have the freedom to make 
decisions based on their student’s needs as well as their own expertise. Professional development is created based on 
the needs of the teachers as well as the shared goals of the school. Administrators lead by example and are open to 
suggestions and feedback from all members of the community, including students. 
We are a community where differences are not only respected but valued. School wide activities and celebrations 
reflect the culture of all members of the school. Families play an integral role in their child’s academic and social 
development so consequently teachers and administrators value the importance of parent engagement. Teachers and 
families participate in conversations that reflect mutual respect and trust. Each member of the community knows that 
they are valued and that their voice matters. 
  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our ENL population needs communication in various languages and families need to be incorporated into our school 
community from the beginning through our International Committee. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

As indicated in our Quality Review and in previous CEP documents we have been working towards creating a school 
culture that is immersed in questioning, feedback and reflection as indicated in 3b of the Danielson Framework. This 
work has guided our thinking and our practice as we have continued to align our curriculum. We have accomplished 
this in conjunction with working on our student’s ability to be reflective and engage in ambitious intellectual activities. 
Our professional development has included Making Thinking Visible, Harvard’s Project Zero, SOLE (Self Organized 
Learning Environments), and Carol Dweck’s Growth Mindset. This has led to our exploration of how to better utilize 
inquiry studies and the ideas around STEAM and MAKER Education. The creation of an addendum to the report cards, 
by each grade level, are “Indicators” of student progress and can also be used for assessment and record keeping 
purposes. Additionally, they keep parents informed, and provide them with more information about their children’s 
growth. We have noted significant gains as it pertains to this work and we have kept the principles of the Framework 
For Great Schools in mind as we continue to work towards our collective goals. One of strengths is our family-school 
partnerships. We have developed a strategic collaboration this year through our MNS Parent Workshop Series. Each

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
In order to reach our targeted goal it was determined that teachers would engage in more professional development 
and plan more strategy lessons in small groups across grade K through 2. Looking closely  

  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2018, 75% of teachers in grades K-5 will conduct small group instruction 2 to 3 days per week in literacy.

and cluster teacher will write a monthly newsletter or article for school-wide quarterly magazine. 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
 

The resources we will leverage to achieve this goal and implement the action plan include using teachers who have 
attended professional Development on this subject matter and who will then turn key the information. We will also 
be utilizing teachers who have expertise in these particular areas as well as the literacy coach, literacy consultant, 
special education teacher, special education consultant, reading intervention specialists and administration. Teachers 
will use PD Mondays, professional development days i.e. Election Day and grade level meetings. Coverage will be 
provided for teachers during planning days and teachers will have the flexibility to do inter-visitations. This can also 
be accomplished by switching prep periods.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
We will engage in progress monitoring throughout the year based on our observation and teacher feedback schedule. 
In January 2018 we will re-evaluate and re-assess plans based on TC Assessment Data and feedback from those 
observations. 

Along with our math coach and literacy coach we have systematically researched data from our ELA and Math test 
scores. Based on the information garnered from the data we have looked at students from each test who have scored 
either a 1 or a 2. Those students, based on data, will be receiving intervention from one of two AIS teachers or from 
the SETTS teacher who will be providing targeted at risk services. We will also be providing students with test 
preparation based on information extracted from our item skills analysis. Prior to the administration of the state tests 
we will be conducting periodic informal and formal assessments every three to four weeks or after a unit of study has 
been completed to determine areas which require continued support. 

In an effort to support our SWD's our PPT Team meets once a week to review RTI strategies tailored to individual 
students. Upon review of each student's progress additional supports may be determined. Along with our special 
education consultant and our special education coordinator we have added paraprofessionals, added more SETTS or 
placed students into the ICT. 

Teachers in grade k through second are working with a literacy staff developer to improve phonics instruction, 
emergent literacy strategies in addition to literacy structures and routines. This will directly correlate to higher tests 
scores in grades three through five.  
 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
Based on information from the PPO reviews it was determined that we needed to take a closer look at our 
assessment criteria. We have instituted a number of measures to address this area. Not only have we used the 
Danielson Framework to inform our feedback to teachers in assessment, we have made it a school wide goal. 
Teachers are required to be using assessment tools, at all times, as they monitor student progress. Rubrics have been 
created as well as assessment portfolios to measure student progress. Along with the report cards we have created 
"Indicators" that specifically measure student growth in the content areas and clearly define individual student goals. 
The "indicators" measure student growth across the year and will be used as an assessment tool not only for 
teachers, in grades three through five, but for students to use as they receive feedback from their teachers. 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
The creation and utilization of the school wide initiative using Report Card Indicators will result in giving more in 
depth feedback to families regarding their children's progress. The Report Card indicators are a set of end of year 
expectations in reading, writing, math and social emotional behaviors that continue to create more rigorous 
instruction in order to improve student outcomes. Based on the continuation of this work, as well our goal of 

100%, Social Studied Indicators will also be created. 

Parents of students have not met their targeted goals and who receive a two on the report cards are notified and are 
made aware of any additional interventions that are available to their children. Those support services continue to be 
added such as intervention, at risk services and guidance, if needed. We have also begun to use the Teachers College 
Units of Study to improve student performance in ELA. Students who require enrichment may participate in the Math 
Olympiad. 
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2018, Content Teams will vertically align 100% of the Math, Reading, Writing, Social/Emotional and Social 
Studies, End of Year Indicators across grades K through 5. Through our Professional Development cycles teachers have 
been working on insuring that all content area subject matter meets all Common Core Standards, that the big 
understandings and ideas match with the Common Core and all teachers are aware of the expectations for each 
grade. Grade level team meetings take place once per week in order to implement and follow through with grade 
level plans. Teachers are also required to study student work in order to analyze trends and establish benchmarks and 
goals for students.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          31 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Manhattan New School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A 
of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

[School name] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 
decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 
● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the 
school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies 
as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical 
support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  
● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of 
the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming 
and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for 
parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support 
services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents 
of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be 
involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other 
applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Teacher's College Reading Assessments are used to assess the early literacy skills of ELLs at our school.  Although students may 
be able to decode, ELLs may not be gaining necessary comprehension.  In addition,  when there is comprehension, students 
may have trouble expressing themselves during this section of the assessment.  Furthermore, newcomer ELLs may not be 
familiar with the vocabulary that is necessary to use context clues or picture clues for help.  This indicates that we need to 
support ELLs with content based vocabulary instruction so that they can implement the appropriate literacy strategies to 
become successful readers.  We will also have to support ELLs in expressing their ideas in order to properly assess their 
comprehension. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?

We have two reading interventionists who provide support for the implementation of TC Assessment to children.  they work 
along side the ENL teacher who confers with the classroom teacher as well.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
To evaluate the success of our ENL program, we use the results and progress shown on the NYSESLATassessment, in addition 
to informal and formal classroom based assessments such as Teacher's College Reading Assessments.  We also use parent 
feedback and measures of individual student progress to help us evaluate the overall success of our ELL program.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We meet on a weekly basis as a team to assess the data and arrange intervention by the ENL teacher or other support staff if 
necessary. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We use data from various sources to guide instruction and provide targeted intervention for students as needed.  We use 
scores from standardized tests, such as the NYSESLAT and NYS ELA and Math tests as well as Teacher’s College Reading 
Assessments.  We also use data from ongoing informal assessments, such as writing samples and classroom task 
performance.  We analyze data from these sources to determine which students can benefit from RTI intervention in addition 
to the ELL services we provide according to CR Part 154.  Targeted intervention for ELLs in ELA, Math and other content areas 
may include additional small-group support during the school-wide extended-day period.  Our reading intervention teacher, 
math coach and SETTs teacher are also available to work with students who are "at-risk." 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data patterns across performance levels on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT indicate that the majority of students across 
emerging, transitioning and expanding and commanding levels score higher on the speaking and listening modalities. Students 
within the entering level usually score the highest on the listening modality.  The revealed patterns may effect student 
grouping, and leaves implications for curriculum planning.  The data can inform the teachers of ELLs about which skills the 
students need to further develop to gain English proficiency.  The data may also inform common branch teachers which areas 
of professional development are needed in order to enhance teaching practices that will target ELLs’ needs.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Our ENL teacher meets with every classroom teacher at the beginning of each year and participates in end of year articulations 
meetings as well.  Over the course of the year, she meets with teachers at least once per month to check in with modifications 
for curriculum. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

In the Freestanding ENL program, students who require stand-alone ENL are pulled-out of their general education 
classroom for their required time mandates for ENL instruction.  Instruction is delivered in a stand-alone ENL program 
in order to develop students' English language skills so they can succeed in core content classes. Instruction is 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

 

delivered by the certified ENL teacher, Marisa Cohen. Students are grouped in ungraded and heterogeneous 
groups.  These groupings are formed by taking into account language proficiency level and grade level.  Students may 
be grouped within two contingous grade levels within two proficiency levels.  The small difference in proficiency levels 
benefits students by having some students as language models and all students feeling comfortable within a group of 
language learners. The integrated ENL program is delivered by the certified ENL teacher with the certified content 
area teacher. For students who require the integrated model, the ENL teacher conducts instruction within the general 
education class alongside the content teacher. The integrated ENL model builds English language skills through the 
content area subject matter. Therefor, students are placed in their general education classes according to their 
proficiency levels up to two continguous levels.  This is done primarily for scheduling purposes. The ENL teacher uses 
ENL methods and strategies to make the content accessible for students.  The ENL teacher is present during grade 
level meetings and meets informally with content teachers to discuss and plan instruction.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

              The results from the NYSESLAT are reviewed each fall to determine if students are still entitled to services and how 
many minutes of instruction they should receive according to the RLAT.  For new ELLs, we use their scores on the NYSITELL to 
determine if they are entitled to services and how many minutes of instruction and in which model they should receive. As per 
CR Part 154, requirements for English as a New Language, students at the entering and emerging levels receive 360 minutes of 
ENL instruction per week with 180 minutes of Freestanding ENL instruction and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL 
Instsruction.  Students at the transitioning level receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction, with 90 minutes of Freestanding ENL 
instsruction and 90 minutes of Integrated ENL instruction. Students at the expanding level receive 180 minutes of Integrated 
ENL instruction during ELA or other content area instruction.  Students at the commanding level receive 90 minutes of 
Integrated ENL instruction in ELA.  Students at the commanding level receive services for two years.  All ENL instruction is 
delivered by a certified TESOL teacher. We ensure that students are receiving their mandated number of minutes by grouping 
students according to proficiency levels within two levels.  This helps with scheduling and ensures that all students are 
receiving their mandated minutes. Students who require only integrated ENL minutes are grouped together and are taken into 
classrooms to receive content instruction delivered by the content area teacher and the certified TESOL teacher, Marisa 
Cohen. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
      It is important to make content accessible and to enrich children’s language development using all modalities of 
learning.  Our Freestanding ENL Program curriculum is designed to support ELLs’ language development, while also providing 
support for the academic content and skills expected for their grade levels.  Using an inquiry-based curriculum, consisting of 
content units that incorporate Common Core ELA Standards and content from the NYS Science Scope and Sequence, our ELLs 
receive targeted instruction that encourages simultaneous development of their English language skills and literacy skills, while 
also making grade-level content comprehensible.   
  
Within the Freestanding stand-alone ENL model, students are engaged in the instructional method of visual research.  Visual 
research is designed around content-based units and incorporate the four modalities of language, reading, writing, listening 
and speaking.  Through the method of visual research, students form and ask questions, and evaluate and analyze information 
presented through various mediums such a photographs, books, and videos.  Students apply their understanding from visual 
research to create deeper understanding of content through partner and whole class discussions. Visual research allows 
multiple entry points for students of all proficiency levels to access the content while keeping the rigor high.  Visual research 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

lessons are differentiated to adapt to meet each student's individual learning needs.  Visual resesarch is a highly scaffolded 
starting point to research based learning, ultimately fostering the development of independent research which incorporates 
student led inquiry using the skills of speaking, listening, reading and writing with fiction and non-fiction text.     
  
  Communicative learning techniques are implemented to help ELLs with both content and academic language. In both the 
Freestanding and Integrated ENL programs, activities such as “stop and jot”, partnerships and “turn and talk”  are used to 
allow students to engage in “accountable talk.”  Newcomers also enjoy participating in Total Physical Response.  As a part of a 
balanced literacy program throughout the school, English Language Learners engage in shared, guided, and independent 
reading in the Freestanding and Integrated ENL programs.  In addition, interactive writing and modeling are an essential part 
of our writer’s workshop.  Students are given the opportunity to explore many different genres in reading and writing.  
  
In the Integrated ENL program, small group work is used to help differentiate the core content and make it accessible for 
ELLs.  Strategies include the use of photographs and illustrations when possible, having discussions and partner talk to develop 
prior knowledge, use of techonology when appropriate for example using the iPad for images and translation opportunities, 
using graphic organizers and front-loading key vocabulary.  
  
ELLs at our school participate in a rigorous program, which is aligned with the Common Core standards and NY State Scope and 
Sequence for Science and Social Studies.  We uphold this academic rigor by using a variety of instructional materials and 
assessments.  Explicit ELL instruction is delivered by teaching language through context and scaffolding learning through the 
use of photographs, illustrations, TPR, language experience methods, shared reading and writing, and guided reading.  The 
NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, and ELL interim assessments can be used as a guideline for instruction.  Results from the interim 
assessments reveal the areas of strength and weakness for each English Language Learner and offer teachers the opportunity 
to design differentiated instruction appropriately.   
  
A wide variety of materials are used to support ELLs, including: 
-     Leveled books         -     Pocket charts 
-     Non-fiction libraries         -     Audiovisuals  
-     Picture dictionaries         -     Realia/ manipulatives 
-     Bilingual dictionaries         -     Personal word walls 
-     Big books for shared reading     -     Hampton Brown resources 
-     Poems             -     Classroom magazines 
-     Songs and chants         -    iPod/iPad/computer recorder 
-     Graphic organizers         -     Books on Cd/ Portable CD Players 
-     Dialog journals         -     iPads and Interactive apps 
-     Sentences strips          -     Interactive websites 
  
     To expand upon some of the abovementioned materials, technology is used to support ELLs in several ways. All classrooms 
at Manhattan New School are equipped with Smart Boards, document cameras and computers to enhance each child’s 
learning experience. The Internet is a useful tool for translation, research, photographs, interactive activities and videos for 
ELLs.  In addition, newcomers are given a portable CD player and books on CD to use in the classroom. The ELL teacher will 
often use an iPod/iPad/computer recorder to record stories and track students’ progress in speaking.   
   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

      As we do not have a dual language or transitional bilingual program, the native language is not regularly used for 
instruction and assessment.  We ensure that students are appropriately evaluated in their native language by administering 
the Spanish LAB to Spanish-speaking ELLs who do not score proficiently on the NYSITELL when they are first admitted.  We 
provide translation services for students on an as needed basis (i.e. translators and/or translated versions of the state math 
exam).  Additionally, informal assessment is conducted in newcomers’ native languages when appropriate.  For example, 
teachers may encourage a newcomer to write in his/her native language in order to demonstrate content knowledge at a time 
when he/she does not yet have the English vocabulary and language skills to accurately represent this knowledge. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

A. Although we do not have any SIFE students, they would receive services as a  “newcomer” at our school.  B. Newcomers 
participate in smaller ELL groups with visually rich lessons to support their entering language development. Newcomers are 
given instruction through stand-alone and integrated ENL programs which provide a variety of instructional settings to 
observe, listen and participate in. All teachers at our school differentiate lessons and assignments for all students, including 
newcomer ELLs. For example, during an integrated ENL lesson, newcomers are allowed to work with a partner, make use of 
manipulatives and draw what they observe in a flower disection activity and can label the parts in their home language.  The 
ENL teacher will then help to translate these labels into the English terms.  The student's drawing, native language and English 
labels work together to provide a content and language rich resource for the student. C. For developing students, specific ELL 
methodologies are used such as scaffolding lessons by using detailed visuals, the use of graphic organizers, and frontloading 
vocabulary. Opportunities to repeat and practice new concepts and language structures are given through different modes of 
learning i.e., kinesthetic, aural, visual and tactile.  Manipulatives are also used to help make abstract ideas more concrete and 
comprehensible. D. Instruction for long term ELLs incorporate the abovementioned ELL methodologies while targetiing 
content area skills. Instruction for these students are delivered in a variety of groupings including small groups, and 
partnerships including working with heterogenious groups.  These long-term ELLs  benefit from a variety of groupings in which 
they play different roles, for example sometimes they are the "expert" or "teacher" and at other times they are learning from 
peers. These different groupings maximize the time they are using English, while in a variety of modes. E. Former ELLs are 
given instruction through Intengrated ENL models and are provided small group instruction in their general education 
classroom. As per CR Part 154, former ELLs are given Integrated ENL instruction for up to 2 years after they have received a 
proficiency of commanding on the NYSESLAT.  All ELL students are given testing accomodations for the New York State exams, 
including English Language Arts, Mathematics, and Science.  Students in testing grades receive ELL accomodations of  extended 
time (time and a half) and a separate location.  Translated test booklets and glossaries are also utilized for high incidence 
languages.  For low incidence languages, certified translators are utilized through approved New York City Department of 
Education vendor, Legal Interpretation Services.     
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Our general education teachers, special education teachers, IEP teacher and ELL teacher collaborate to implement multiple 
instructional strategies and use materials to provide ELL-SWD’s access to all academic content areas and to accelerate their 
English language development.  Instruction is aligned with the students’ IEPs, as well as with their language proficiency levels 
and corresponding needs.  By using small group instruction and individual instruction that is designed based on students’ 
needs, teachers are able to appropriately support ELL-SWD’s. By delivering instruction using strategies that meet each 
student’s individual needs, teachers are able to make content comprehensible.  Teachers also use a balanced literacy approach 
to instruction, ensuring that ELL-SWD’s continually develop all four modalities of English development.  In addition to 
instructional strategies used in the classroom, targeted interventions for ELLs in ELA, Math and other content areas include 
additional small-group support.  Our IEP teacher, reading intervention teacher and math coach are also available to work with 
students who are "at-risk." For newcomer and developing ELLs, materials such as manipulatives, visuals and realia are used to 
provide access to academic content and accelerate English language development.  For long term ELLs and Former ELLs, 
materials such as graphic organizers, and scaffolding strategies such as front loading vocabulary are used to provide access to 
academic content areas.  Technology provides support to all ELL subgroups. Ipad programs such as Duolingo, Google Translate, 
Google Images help to provide translation, visual support and explicit language learning in a dynamic medium.  Students utilize 
iMovie to make movies about researched topics, and use the camera function to video their discussions (including their 
speaking and listening skills) in order to evaluate at a later date.    
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Teachers and related service providers collaborate to ensure that ELL-SWD’s achieve their IEP goals and attain English 
proficiency within the least restrictive environment. Collaboration includes aligning scheduling (using flexible scheduling during 
ELA or Math as needed) and instruction, as well as conferencing about student progress and redesigning instruction as 
needed.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Frequent conferences between classroom teachers and the ELL teacher allow our school to provide targeted instruction for 
ELLs and transitional ELLs when needed.  Targeted interventions for ELLs in ELA, Math and other content areas include 
additional small-group support during the school day with the ELL teacher, math coach, reading specialist, Reading Recovery 
teacher, or other appropriate teachers.  All intervention services are offered in English as the language of instruction. The ELL 
subgroups targeted for intervention programs include long term ELLs who are performing at the bottom 30% of the class and 
developing ELLs who do not show progress on the NYSESLAT. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We may consider adding an enrichment program that will take place before or after school. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We do not plan to discontinue any programs or services for ELLs. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal acess to any and all school programs and are represented in all programs, including the school based 
extended day, intervention services, field trips, National Dance Institute, New York City Ballet partnership, lunch-clubs such as 
sewing, jewelry making, chess, robotics, circus, rainbow loom, simply sports and after-school programs such as crafting, 
healthy cooking, board games, geography club, debate club, track club, Girls on the Run, iceskating, little runners, little sports, 
literature and the arts and baking.  ELLs are invited through translated school-based flyers and announcements on the school 
website which is translated by Google Translate. The majority of these activities are visually based and hands on which allow 
ELLs to fully and equally participate at any language level.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
A wide variety of materials are used to support ELLs, including: 
-     Leveled books             -     Pocket charts 
-     Non-fiction libraries         -     Audiovisuals  
-     Picture dictionaries         -     Realia/ manipulatives 
-     Bilingual dictionaries         -     Personal word walls 
-     Big books for shared reading     -     Hampton Brown resources 
-     Poems                 -     Classroom magazines 
-     Songs and chants             -     iPod/iPad/computer recorder 
-     Graphic organizers         -     Books on Cd/ Portable CD Players 
-     Dialog journals             -     iPads and Interactive apps 
-     Sentences strips              -     Interactive websites 
-           Wilson Fundations                           -     Classroom Word Walls 
-           Raz Kids                                         -     Book Flix

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

  
     To expand upon some of the abovementioned materials, technology is used to support ELLs in several ways. All classrooms 
at Manhattan New School are equipped with Smart Boards, document cameras and computers to enhance each child’s 
learning experience. The Internet is a useful tool for translation, research, photographs, interactive activities and videos for 
ELLs.  In addition, newcomers are given a portable CD player and books on CD to use in the classroom. The ELL teacher will 
often use an iPod/iPad/computer recorder to record stories and track students’ progress in speaking. Newcomers also make 
portable word walls to use at home and at school and during different content classes such as computers or 
science.  Developing , Transitional and Long Term ELLs utilize technology such as the iPad to translate, self assess (using video 
feedback), and conduct independent research.     
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

  
Throughout our school, native language and culture is portrayed in students’ independent writing and presentations. Students 
are encouraged to share their cultural knowledge with others.  This philosophy is especially important in the ELL 
classroom.  For example, ELL students may create Venn Diagrams and compare traditions in their country to the United 
States.  We have a library of books in native languages, as well as bilingual dictionaries for students to use.  As previously 
mentioned, in some cases, native language may also be used to help scaffold instruction and assessment.  For example, 
students who have just arrived may feel more comfortable writing and reading in their native language. This allows them to 
continue expressing their ideas, while they grow and eventually begin participating in English.             
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

In addition to the aforementioned procedures in place to ensure that ELL services address appropriate language and content 
needs, we ensure that ELL services and resources correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels by providing various leveled books 
across grades, ensuring that all teachers are aware of various resources available, and utlizing community language services 
offered.  Information gathered from formal and informal assessments, conferences, and student work help to ensure that the 
support ELLs are receiving the support to match their age and grade level.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
A wide variety of materials are used to support ELLs, including: 
-     Leveled books             -     Pocket charts 
-     Non-fiction libraries         -     Audiovisuals  
-     Picture dictionaries         -     Realia/ manipulatives 
-     Bilingual dictionaries         -     Personal word walls 
-     Big books for shared reading     -     Hampton Brown resources

science.  Developing , Transitional and Long Term ELLs utilize technology such as the iPad to translate, self assess (using video 
feedback), and conduct independent research.     
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our parent coordinator is closely involved with parents of newly enrolled students and is available to help them prior to the 
beginning of the school year.  Often times, newly enrolled ELLs are introduced to the ELL teacher and shown around the school 
beforehand.  In addition, an "ice-cream social" is held in June as a way for newly enrolled kindergarteners to meet before the 
upcoming school year. The guidance counselor is introduced to parents to inform them about services offered and student 
interest groups i.e., divorce, adoption etc. in addition to helping parents of 5  th   graders navigate the middle school process. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We do not currently offer any langauge electives during the school day.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We do not currently offer a dual language program. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Staff development is an extremely important part of our learning community. Our administration, as well as all teachers and 
other support staff including our secretary, parent coordinator and guidance counselors, who work with ELLs are all involved in 
professional development.  Our teachers and support staff participate in a weekly staff meeting where we discuss topics that 
pertain to our school community.  These topics often include how we can best meet the needs of our ELL students.   
Throughout the past several years, our teachers have taken advantage of many additional professional development 
opportunities, including attending conferences, as well as workshops offered at local universities and at local community 
organizations, including museums.  Attending these conferences and workshops allows our teachers to stay informed about 
new approaches and techniques to best-support ELLs in their academic and language development, as well as methods of 
assessment.  
Our ELL teacher also continues to participate in professional development opportunities offered by the New York City 
Department of Education, as well as study groups with other ELL teachers in District 2.  This Professional Learning Residency 
and collaboration with local ELL teachers has greatly enriched our ELL program. 
This year, all teachers will receive 15% ELL-specific professional development and ENL teachers will receive 50% total hours of 
ELL-specific professional development.  The goal is for the ENL teacher to provide school based ELL-specific professional 
development for all teachers in a five week hour-long workshop model after school in the spring.  Topics to be included, but 
not limited to are "FAQ's and Resources about Second Language Learning", "Getting Your Classroom Ready for ELLs", "Basic 
Strategies and Ways to Differentiate for ELLs", "The Experience of The English Language Learner", and "Making Content 
Comprehensible through Teacher Made Materials". Dates for these PD's include, March 14, March 21, April 11, May 9 and May 
16, 2015. 
  
The ELL teacher will continue to participate in professional development opportunities provided by the Department of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

 

Education and Department of English Language Learners.  A significant portion of the professional development offered to 
teachers, including teachers of ELLs, this year will focus on aligning our instruction to the Common Core Learning 
Standards.  This is a learning process that our teachers have been engaged in during the past few school years.  In addition, the 
ELL teacher has been participating in a Professional Learning Residency headed by the ELL Acheivement Coah with several local 
ELL teachers during the 2014-2015 school year.  The main topics of this group have included how to align ELL instruction with 
the Common Core Learning Standards and how to support ELLs in engaging with the standards. During the 2015-2016 school 
year, the ELL teacher has been participating in professional development opportunities provided by the Department of English 
Language Learners such as "Start up Policies and Procedures for English Language Learners and Changes to Comissioner's 
Regulations CR Part 154" held on October 7, 2015 and ongoing workshops as they become available.  The ELL teacher is also 
attending the UFT Teacher Center workshop entitled "Working Together: Applying ENL Strategies in the Integrated Classroom" 
on Saturday, November 7, 2015. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our parent coordinator, guidance counselor and teachers work together to assist ELLs as they transition from elementary to 
middle school.  This includes informing ELLs and their parents about all middle school options.  The guidance counselor meets 
with every family individually to assist in the middle school choice process.  In addition, the guidance counselor meets with 
students on whole class and individual levels to discuss the middle school process as well as practice interviewing skills.  We 
encourage students and their families to go on school tours and help them find a school that best meets their needs.  If 
necessary, we also contact middle schools to inquire more about their programs for ELLs.   
All teachers will receive 15% of their professional development in ELL-specific professional development.  Professional 
development will be offered by the ELL teacher during school-wide staff meetings.  We will implement a professional 
development plan to satisfy the ELL professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2.  This program will aim to 
provide generalized support to all teachers who work with ELLs and to provide additional targeted support in order to meet 
individual teachers’ needs.  All K-5th grade teachers (including general education, special education, art, music, physical 
education, technology and science teachers) at P.S. 290 will participate in a five week hour-long workshop with the goals of 
developing their understanding of English language acquisition building strategies for working with ELLs in order to encourage 
language development and make content comprehensible.  These meetings will be held during staff meetings and will be led 
by the ELL teacher.  Topics to be covered may include differentiating the needs and expectations of ELLs by proficiency level, 
incorporating strategies to make content comprehensible for ELLs at all proficiency levels, aligning ELA and Math CCLS to meet 
the needs of ELLs, and how to encourage ELLs to develop and use academic language when writing and during classroom 
discussions.  In addition to the staff meetings, the ELL teacher will schedule individual meetings with teachers on an as-needed 
basis to further develop strategies to meet individual ELLs’ needs. Agendas and attendance will be taken and securely filed by 
the ENL teacher.  In addition, the ENL teacher will receive 50% of ELL-specific professional development by attending 
professional development offered by the Department of English Language Learners,  community universities and 
colleges.  Again, agendas will be filed and securely stored. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Individual meetings with parents of ELLs are scheduled throughout the year to keep parents abreast of their child's language 
development progress during the weekly designated parent interaction time on Tuesdays after school from 3:00-4:00. The 
parents are informed of their child's progress, strengths and current goals.  Tips for helping their children at home are also 
offered during these individual conferences. Parents are also encouraged to ask questions and communicate any concerns at 
this meeting as well. If a parent requires translation, a staff member who speaks the language is asked to assist. If no staff

member is available, the Translation and Interpretation Unit will be reached for over the phone translation. Records of these 
meetings and outreach including dates and times of phone calls, emails and attendance are kept on file and stored securely. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Our school community prides itself on its high level of parental involvement.  Parents of ELL students are encouraged to 
participate in a variety of school activities throughout the year.  These activities may include reading with their child on "First 
Fridays," being a “mystery reader”, sharing cultural traditions in a classroom interview or accompanying a class on a field 
trip.  School fundraisers and class celebrations are another way for parents of ELLs to get involved.  Some parents, including 
those of ELLs, also volunteer in the school on a regular basis. A newly formed International and Global Committee is also a way 
for parents of ELLs to become involved.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Doreen Esposito, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

A number of steps are taken in order to assess our school's translation and interpretation needs. Our parent 
coordinator meets with each family individually upon registration. She takes notes and informs the ENL teacher 
about any language preferences or concerns. In addition, the licensed ENL teacher helps parents to complete the 
HLIS form. The ENL teacher interviews parents about their language preference for school communication both 
written and orally. We use this information, along with the NYSITELL assessments, Blue Emergency Contact cards, 
the ATS report of Preferred Languages, and parent and teacher surveys to gain a better understanding of our ENL 
population and their families. Furthermore, we continue to assess these needs during the ENL parent orientation 
in the fall and as new students register, including during parent conferences held throughout the school year. Our 
data indicates that the majority of parents prefer to communicate in English. However, there is a small need for 
translation in Turkish and Italian.

2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

communication in English. 
However, there is a small 
need for oral and written 
translation in Turkish and 
Italian.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

We will provide a letter to inform parents of their rights to translation and interpretation services at registration in 
September and ongoing throughout the year. Letters can be translated by the Department of Education Translation 
and Interpretation Unit.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our data indicates that a majority of parents prefer to communicate in English. However, there is a small need for 
translation in Italian and Turkish. These findings are passed onto the school community by our parent coordinator or 
ENL teacher. Any related issues may be discussed at staff meetings, PTA meetings or during individual meetings with 
teachers. Feedback about the quality and availability of services is gathered through parent surveys and informal 
interactions between parents and school staff. The newly formed "Global Committee" may schedule a focus group of 
parents inclusive of all cultures and languages represented in our school to gather feedback and best practices 
regarding translation, interpretation and culturally sensitive topics.
