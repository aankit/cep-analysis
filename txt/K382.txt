Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

We are developing a compassionate, innovative, collaborative community of learners prepared to access and 
contribute to the ever-changing global and digital worlds. 

Vision 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

We believe that schools should be guided by one clear principle: that everything they do should be “what’s best for 
students.” Using the principle of building meaningful relationships, making school work relevant and practicing rigor, 
Our goal is to connect the students’ interest to relevant and meaningful learning experience in the real world. We will 
value families and involve them in the students’ learning process and urge students to always do their personal best. 
Our teaching and administrative staff will always be passionate about educating students one child at a time. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The Academy for College Preparation and Career Preparation is a grade 6 through grade 12 learning environment. The 
school services a student population in the middle school that consist of , 78% Black, and 19% Hispanic; while the high 
school services a population consisting of , 84% Black and 16% Hispanic.  

 

The philosophy of our team is that all students can and will learn once they are provided with the necessary structures 
and support. Our aim is to provide the necessary supports that will address each individual student need and use data 
to effectively support their learning. We endeavor to individualize instruction through the use of differentiated 
instructional strategies and addition support mechanism such as: extended day, teacher guided tutoring, peer 
tutoring, and the Advanced Success Academy (ASA) that are designed to improve our student cognitive abilities while 
giving acceleration opportunities to those who wish to advance. It is important to note that we focus heavily on the 
lower third students both in the middle school and high school. Our aim is to ensure that our lower third students 
(English Language Learners and Students with Special Needs) are provided with personalized learning opportunities. 
These supports include, but are not limited to, monthly guidance meetings with the students that is supported by 
Restorative Justice practices, weekly parent/guidance conferences designed to address student progress, ASA, 
Lunch/peer tutoring, and personalized learning plans. 

 

Additionally, we address the needs of our highly proficient learners through our partnership with Brooklyn College 
and TRIO, Berkeley College, LIU and Medgar Evers to ensure that this subset of students is provided with services that 
challenges their cognitive abilities and provides them with the skill sets necessary for college and career readiness. 
These students are exposed to college classes and are supported by a Brooklyn College Community Partnership 
(BCCP) mentor who support their academic needs and their college application process. In our quest to continue 
supporting our students we have developed partnerships with organizations such as Urban Advantage, Champs 
(basketball and volleyball) and New York Edge to provide our students with additional academic and extracurricular 
opportunities. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

A variety of students come to our school from low socio-economic backgrounds, and with cultural diffusion 
challenges. It is important to note that our learning community in the middle school services a population of 7% 
English Language Learners and 17% Students with Special Needs, while the high school learning environment services 
10% English Language Learners and 21% Students with Special Needs. This year, we will introduce our first cohort of 
bilingual students with disabilities.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

We increased our graduation rate from 58% (2016) to 71.5% (2018). Our high school students demonstrated gains on 
all NYSED Regents examinations except ELA, Algebra and Algebra 2/Trigonometry. Our middle school students 
increased their Regents pass rate from 20% to 50% on the Earth Science and US History Regents examinations.

For the 2018-2019 school year our foci are: 

 

1) Creating culturally responsive learning conditions that utilize culturally responsive pedagogical practices to improve 
literacy and numeracy levels  

2) Evidence of instructional coherence across all classrooms utilizing the Summit Learning Cognitive Skills Rubric and 
Habits of Success as our primary foundational anchors for improving 21st century learning skills across grades 6 to 12 

3) Increasing Teacher Leadership to develop sustainable systems and structures

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
At College Prep, 50% of our middle school students graduated from 8th grade with a passing score on the Earth 
Science and US History Regents exams.  

 

Our high school students demonstrated the following changes in Regents examinations: 18.6% increase in Global 
Regents performance, 15% increase in US History, 8.3% increase in Geometry, 9% increase in Living Environment, 8% 
decrease in ELA performance, and no change in the pass rate for Algebra or Alg 2/Trigonometry Regents. 

 

The item analysis for these assessments demonstrate that students consistently struggle with foundational literacy 
and numeracy skills.  

 

We will focus on amplifying the focus on, and improvement of, our student’s literacy and numeracy skills. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June of 2019 there will be a 40% increase in the percentage of students making growth in the level 3 and level 4 
combined scores on the NY State Math Middle School Exam.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 
Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed 
to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

 

The Principal, Assistant Principals and Teachers will engage in 
daily professional learning communities using the Cognitive 
Skills Rubric from Summit Learning, a research-based 
assessment and instruction tool that outlines the continuum of 
36 interdisciplinary, higher-order thinking skills that are 
necessary to improve numeracy and literacy skills and build the 
21st-century skills that students need to become college and 
career ready. 

Each student will receive a Personalized Learning Plan that is co-
constructed with their ELA teacher to identify their long-term 
and short-term academic and personal goals. Students will 
utilize this plan to closely track their weekly and monthly 
performance in each core subject area and become self-
directed learners who take an active role in ensuring their 
academic needs are being addressed effectively. 

SWD Team will meet once per week to track and monitor the 
progress of students with disabilities’ academic progress, 
attendance, social-emotional adjustment in school, and 
progress on targeted technology platforms. The team will 
monitor the use of accommodations in the core subject areas 
for students as required by their IEPs. This team will share their 
findings with subject-area teachers and work collaboratively 
with subject-area teachers to provide additional needed 
support and intervention strategies to improve SWD access to 
rigorous instructional outcomes. 

Based on the research from the NYCDOE “Educators Guide to 
Disciplinary Literacy,” teachers of math, science and social 
studies will utilize disciplinary literacy for students to participate 
in ways that mimic how experts within a particular discipline 
behave, while content-area literacy will be focused primarily on 
helping students employ good reading and study skills.

Through our newly created ENL Success Team which will meet 
weekly, we will provide all teachers of ENL Students with the 
ability to apply the background knowledge of ENLs, including 
their language proficiency profiles, in planning differentiated 
language teaching. For the purposes of this goal, we define Tier 
1 as core instruction, Tier 2 as small-group strategic 
intervention for students who are struggling and Tier 3 as 
intensive intervention for students with significant and 
persistent needs. Our focus areas are academic instruction, 
progress monitoring and family-school partnerships. We will 
provide students the opportunity to develop academic oral 
language while simultaneously teaching literacy and other 
content areas, provide designated time to develop English oral 
language proficiency, teach high-utility academic words, teach 
word-learning strategies, use peer-supported instruction and 
learning, teach explicit comprehension strategies, and 
implement culturally responsive instruction.  

Research indicates that there is a deep connection between 
social-emotional development and literacy and this connection 
is a critical component necessary to promote children’s school 
success including achieving high literacy proficiency. Our 
Guidance Counselors will lead the School Literacy and 
Numeracy Council. This team will focus on the development of 
systemic strategies and approaches aligning and making 
seamless the promotion and integration of social-emotional 
development and literacy. Utilizing the research-based “Habits 
of Success” from Summit Learning, our counselors will push in, 
weekly, into classrooms to support the development of self-
regulation, among other Habits of Success, to support student’s 
ability to participate in relationships with peers and adults, to 
solve problems and exercise curiosity. 

Implement Breakfast After the Bell through our Health and 
Wellness Squad comprised of students and a Teacher as Faculty 
Advisor. Students will be able to get breakfast and arrive to 
class on time. Breakfast has been suggested to positively affect 
learning in children in terms of behavior, cognitive, and school 
performance.  

Parents will be engaged in workshops held monthly through our 
Parent Academy so they may learn “Habits of Success” 
strategies that will support and align to the expectations for the 
students in school.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Our School Quality Guide (2017-18) indicates a steady increase in the area of “Supportive Environment.” These gains 
are significant because the percentage of students doubled from school year 2016-17 to 2017-18. Therefore, a greater 
number of students (322) feel College Prep is a supportive environment. 

 

We utilize Restorative Justice practices, advisory and individualized Guidance Sessions to ensure we are providing 
support for the whole child. However, research indicates that we can do an even better job of supporting our 
students by ensuring we are offering culturally response classroom conditions and teaching practices. Geneva Gay, in 
Culturally Responsive Teaching – Theory, Practice and Pedagogy (2004) defines culturally responsive pedagogy as the 
use of cultural knowledge, prior experiences, frames of reference, and performance styles of ethnically diverse 
students to make learning encounters more relevant to and effective for them. It teaches to and through the 
strengths of these students. It is culturally validating and affirming. The research is clear and we will train and support 
teachers in the use of culturally responsive practices (both in classroom conditions and pedagogy) this school year. 
Culturally responsive classroom conditions and teaching practices lead to increased academic outcomes for minority 
students -our majority population (Gehlbach, 2018). 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, through the implementation of added family nights and KINVO, we will increase our value for 
“Supportive Environment” on the School Quality Guide from 2.78 (2017-18) to 3.50 or higher.

Our Diversity and Equity Team will develop monthly online 
surveys in google classroom for all students to monitor student 
thoughts, opinions and concerns around the environment and 
academic expectations. A baseline survey will be given in 
September and monitoring will occur each month. The team will 
utilize monthly pd sessions to share out data with the teachers 
and other staff to ensure classroom conditions and practices 
support improvement in the metrics being measured. 

Our Student Government (aka Passion Squad) represents 
students in grades 6 to 12. The Diversity and Equity Team will 
meet with the Student Government once a month to inform the 
plan for ensuring classroom conditions exhibit the culturally 
responsive classroom descriptors we’ve identified as being 
necessary to ensure a more supportive environment. Those 
descriptors are: climate of inclusion, connections between 
students’ prior knowledge and learning; rigor/high expectations, 
classroom practices that are hands-on, cooperative and culturally 
aligned, responsiveness based on cultural knowledge of student, 
recognition of varying rates of acculturation, and teacher self-
awareness.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

At College Prep, we ensure that teachers meet daily in teams that are relevant to their practice. Outside of daily team 
meetings, teachers have extended opportunities to engage in professional collaboration through our existing school-
wide teams which includes: ENL Success Team, Summit Learning Team, Digital Transformation Team, SWD Team. In 
2017-18, we began the practice of Instructional Learning Walks. Small groups of teachers were released for one full 
day and engaged in norming activities around specific Danielson indicators, classroom observations, and providing 
“instructional next steps” and “celebratory” feedback to their colleagues. Teachers found this practice to be valuable 
and we will continue this practice in 2018-19. 

 

Our 2018 Quality Review indicated we were proficient in 4.2, measuring how teachers engage in structured 
professional collaborations. Our 2017-18 School Quality Guide indicated that 90% of teachers believed we have a 
collaborative environment.  

 

We want to move our rating of 4.2 to Highly Effective and our School Quality Guide indicator to 100%. We also need 
to ensure that these ratings improve in service of increased student outcomes. Because we may not receive a Quality 
Review this school year, we will have to choose an alternative assessment to measure growth in structured 
professional collaborations which will be the participation rate of our Instructional Learning Walks and rubric-driven 
performance effectiveness of teacher teams.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
 

By June 2019, every teacher will participate in a minimum of two school-wide Instructional Learning Walks and engage 
in daily team meetings that focus on student-centered inquiry and an increase in personalized learning strategies for all 
students which will lead to a 30% increase in the number of students passing the ELA Regents.

support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In 2017-18, College Prep utilized the talent on its team to increase distributed leadership. Teachers delivered 
professional learning and spearheaded the Digital Transformation Team, the Hiring Committee and other smaller 
committees to improve the school environment and take on significant leadership roles. We will continue to promote 
transformative leadership by increasing opportunities for teachers to take on additional leadership roles in the school. 
Our 2017-18 School Survey indicated that 81% of teachers felt that the principal, teachers and staff collaborate to 
make the school run effectively. While this value was above the borough and city averages, we would like to see that 
percentage increase. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, we will foster teacher leadership in our two most challenging areas (middle school math and high school 
social studies) by ensuring our teacher leaders attend various professional learning sessions and turnkey that 
information to department and inquiry teams. Through this work, our goal is to increase student middle school math 
scores by 40% (level 3 and 4) and to increase our High School Global Regents pass rates (by 40%) and High School US 
History Regents pass rates (by 35%).

Our Learning Community has an active and dynamic group of parents whose participation in school wide activities are 
well recorded. These parents attend curriculum fairs, PA meetings; school based and student run events (math and 
science family night, culture day, and career day). However, we have long recognized the importance of parents in our 
school community such that community events that include their attendance has increased in an effort to foster 
trustworthy relationships.  

 

Strengths: 

 

  Our 2017-18 School Quality Guide indicates that 94% of parents feel family and community involvement is 

promoted.  

  Our 2017-18 School Quality Guide indicates that 95% of parents say we communicate in a language and way 

they can understand 

  Our school received $315,000 from Borough President Eric Adams for Mobile Stem Labs. 

We have more work to do to ensure that we take advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the 
school and communicate more frequently with parents.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 17K382, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

17K382 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

To date, the school has identified 63 ENL students (6-12) with diverse needs and across all 
subject areas.  Mandated services are provided during their regular school day by subject area 
teachers who have received training in differentiating instructional plans for the ENL student. 
 
In addition to providing services per NYSED and NYCDOE mandates, students will receive 
further academic and social emotional supports funded by the school’s Title III 
allocation.  Guidance support, enrichment experiences and test preparation will be offered 
Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, after school from 2:25-3:55 and on Saturdays from 9am-
noon.  Certified / licensed teacher(s) of ENL will be staffed and paid per session to provide these 
opportunities to our ENLs at a student teacher ratio of no greater than 10-1; the program will run 
November 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019. 
 
Past Regents results, scholarship reports, midterm and final exam grades, teacher referrals and 
OORs data will be used to identify student’s academic deficiencies and social-emotional 
needs.  ENL Parent workshops will be offered, and with the assistance of interpreters, parents 
will be informed of the opportunities available to them and to their child(ren.)    
 
The ENL teacher will attend City-wide, FSC and privately sponsored PD to extend his/her own 
pedagogical growth, including PD on the use of technology that would enhance the learning 
experience of our ENL students.  Weekend, holiday and after-school trips will be an integral part 
of the extended day experience for our ENLs.  Student supplies, admissions fees, translated 
material, test prep materials, laptops, audio equipment and food will be provided in the extended 
day program.  
  
The administration and ENL teacher(s) involved will maintain records including student 
attendance, student programs, parent sign-in sheets, agendas, receipts, parent permission slips, 
and copies of glossaries and alternate language materials prepared for or purchased for our ENLs 
use.   All records will be kept in the school and available for review upon request. 
 
Parents will receive letters in their native language and in English; when possible, telephone calls 
will be made in the family’s home language.  ENLs will have access to and will receive the same 
college a career readiness opportunities as their general education peers.

our ENLs use.   All records will be kept in the school and available for review upon request. 
High quality professional development related to the program created for ELLs will be provided 
throughout the school year to faculty and the staff of 17K382, Academy for College Preparation 
and Career Exploration. The professional development will be conducted by the ENL teacher 
based on the premise that: 
 
--ENL students struggle in their content area classes, more so when those courses contain a great 
deal of reading and writing 
--ENL students do not have the same cultural background knowledge as their American born 
peers 
--are unfamiliar with the format of standardized tests those content areas. 
 
PD topics include: 
--Scaffolding Instruction for ELLs 
--Differentiation of Materials for ELLs 
--Awareness of the Unique Needs of ELLs 
--The Additive Approach (how to incorporate students' native languages in the classroom) 
 
All content area teachers including Global, US History, AP courses, Middle School courses, 
English, Algebra, Geometry, Algebra 2, Living Environment, Earth Science, and Physics will 
receive the PD. The PD described is part of the school's 2018-19 Professional Development Plan. 
We will also participate in the ENL professional development provided by the Brooklyn South 
FSC. 
 
Record-keeping will not be at cost to the program.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Certified ENL teacher(s) will meet with parents each month; individually and/or as a 
group. Invitations will be made by telephone, text (Kinvo) and through the use of flyers made in 
the parent's native language whenever possible.  In an effort to minimize feelings of isolation, 
and to encourage family involvement, outreach will be made, translators will be provided, and 
food will be made available at these meetings.    
Parents of each ELL  will be invited in for a family conference at school to initiate parental 
involvement and to initiate and foster a good parent-teacher-school relationship. During these 
conferences, parents are informed of upcoming meetings, programs for parents of ELLs, and the 
use of Skedula. The parents' best availability for meetings is also ascertained so that the meetings 
can be scheduled when the greater number of parents can attend and to stagger the schedule 
between days and evenings so that more parents are available to attend. The topics af the parent 
meetings will include: graduation requirements, school support services offered, Regents exams 
and state testing, fostering literacy at home, using Skedula, and utilizing community resources 
(museums, art exhibits, zoos, performances, and parks) to provide valuable learning experiences. 
Parents will receive a letter informing them of the meetings and the topics in English and in their 
home language. Mr. GianMarco Ramirez and Mr. Juan Colon can provide Spanish interpretation. 
Mr. Richard can provide translation in Haitian-Creole. Ms. Mohagna provides translation in 
Arabic. 
Parents can indicate on their RSVP if they would like interpretation available in other languages. 
Staff at ACPCE and on the Erasmus campus can provide interpretation, and if need be, services 
can be requested from the NYC DOE's Language translation Unit. The goal of these meetings is 
to help parents feel informed about and comfortable with school requirements, policies, and 
procedures, their rights and choices as a parent of an ELL, the State's academic content and 
achievement standards, the state and local academic assessments, as well as alternate assessment, 
how to monitor their child's progress, and how to communicate and work with educators.  These 
parent workshops will be held once a month.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The students' reading levels are assessed by the Teacher's College Reading Assessments. The data have shown us that the 
most ELLs need literacy instruction to be able to read at content textbook level. ELLs with IEPs show reading levels that are 
several grade levels behind the students' grade placement. This has necessitated an emphasis on early literacy skills in the ENL 
classroom and a differentiation of materials and scaffolding support for ELLs in the content classes.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We utilize IO Assessments in Skedula and Assessment meetings will monitor and track performance. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our programs for ELLs is based on the data from the NYSESLAT test scores and the number of ELLs passing their 
Regents exams. Our ELLs consistently show an increase in test scores and each year we have students who are able to fully 
transition to ELA classes after reaching proficiency in all four modalities on the NYSESLAT.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Our instructional leadership team will prescribe needed interventions and consult with teachers.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Not applicable. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
On the NYSITELL, most of our students perform at the Beginning or Entering level. On the NYSESLAT, the data reveals that 
students have a higher proficiency in speaking and listening than in reading and writing. There are students who have reached 
the level of proficiency in speaking and listening but may be at a lower level in reading and writing and thus must continue to 
receive ENL services. Across the grade levels, there is a high degree of variation. There are Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, 
Expanding, and Proficient students across the grade levels. There are newcomer ELLs and Emerging and Transitioning students, 
in both junior high and senior high grades.  Length of time in the United States is a better predictor of the Commanding level 
as well as scores on the NYSESLAT (as opposed to just grade level status).   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Weekly meetings will be used to review and modify, where necessary, current structures and programs. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

a. The model at ACPCE is standalone ENL. Classes offered are based on proficiency levels using both the 
heterogeneous and homogeneous model. The students who are identified as Entering and Emerging in their language 
proficiency attend two periods of ENL per day.  Students identified at higher levels take our higher level course, in 
addition to the ELA class. Due to programming constraints, some more advanced students attend the Emerging and 
Transitioning class in which case the ENL teacher provides work at each student's respective level.  Our ENL teacher 
also pushes in to the English classes as well as other subject area classes.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           a. Explicit ENL and ELA instructional minutes are delivered as per CR Part 154. All Entering students have two periods of 
ENL each day five times per week and the ENL teacher also pushes in up to five times a week, thus meeting the requirement of 
540 minutes per week for Entering ELLs. All Emerging and Transitioning students have two periods of ENL each day five days 
per week thus meeting the requirement of 360 minutes per week.  All Expanding students have one period of ENL per day five 
days a week as well as one period of ELA  instruction five times per week, thus meeting the requirement of 180 minutes of ENL 
instruction and 180 minutes per week of ELA instruction.  Commanding students, though deemed proficient, still have access 
to services (including ENL teacher in ELA class) as mandated by state regulations.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   The ENL teacher uses a range of instructional methods to ensure that students are building comprehension across all content 
areas along with linguistic knowledge, development, and performance in English. All units are thematic-based and designed 
around an essential question. The essential question is then explored and developed through all genres of literature, including 
fiction, content-area texts, informational readings, poetry, historical non-fiction, and drama. In addition, ENL texts and 
teacher-generated ESL lessons are utilized to teach English across all content areas.  
    By meeting with content area teachers by grade level and by subject area, the ENL teacher learns which material needs 
scaffolding support in the ENL class and suggests differentiation and scaffolding that can be put in place in by the content 
teacher in order to provide the ELLs with access to the content curriculum. 
   All content at ACPCE is delivered in English. Some support in Spanish is given in the ENL classroom. The ENL teacher does not 
speak Haitian Creole, Arabic, Fulani, or French, so English is the mode of communication in the ENL classroom as well. 
  The native language is supported by the availability of bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, homogeneous language groupings, 
online bilingual resources, bilingual textbooks, and the pairing of a same-language 'buddy'. The ENL teacher is also able to 
provide Spanish interpretation and translation. Students can strengthen their Spanish and French skills through advanced 
language classes at ACPCE (for Spanish) and through a partnership with other schools on the Erasmus campus (for French). 
Students can take the LOTE.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   At this time, the LAB in Spanish is the only first language assessment that has been used this year.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

6. a. Instructional plan for SIFE: Educational interventions are written and implemented for all SIFE at ACPCE. The interventions 
are based on student data acquired through both formal and informal assessments in ENL and the content areas, as 
communicated by the student's teachers in each subject area. The student's strengths are drawn upon to plan motivation 
curriculum and to design differentiated means of assessment that will both challenge the student and also allow him or her to 
experience academic success.  The ENL teacher's lessons will introduce and build upon the fundamental skills and knowledge 
required for full academic participation and success across the curriculum. In addition, SIFE are given the resource of extra 
tutoring both during and after school. 
b. Instructional plan for newcomers: Newcomers participate in our Balanced Literacy Program at ACPCE.  In the ENL class, the 
teacher models reading comprehension strategies, vocabulary building strategies, phonics, and writing practice in mini-lessons 
which are followed by group, paired, and individual student practice. Whenever possible, art and music are integrated into the 
lessons in order to reach all student levels of comprehension and knowledge and to allow for differentiated assessment. 
Testing accommodations, i.e. extended time, are afforded. 
c. Instructional plan for ELLs receiving 4-6 years of ENL service: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

Students receiving 4-6 years of ENL service are identified by the ENL teacher, content area teachers, and guidance counselors 
using the available student data reports. The teachers and counselors meet to discuss the student's current academic track 
record and potential graduation date. In addition, most of these ELLs attend after school in order to meet  the academic 
graduation requirements. We also provide them with general testing accommodations. 
d. Instructional plan for long-term ELLs: In order to help long-term ELLs meet graduation requirements and achieve academic 
success, after-school classes are offered for the content area courses, such as history, English, and science. Students and their 
parents are informed both in writing and verbally about the programs available to them that will help them prepare for 
Regents exams. All long-term ELLs are encouraged to attend the program offerings by their ENL and content area teachers. 
Furthermore, like the 4-6-year ELLs, these students are tracked and discussed on a monthly basis by their ENL teacher, content 
area teachers, and guidance counselors. These long-term ELLs have extended time on their exams. 
e. In years one and two after testing proficient, ELLs continue to have their ENL teacher provide language acquisition 
support.  These Commanding students continue to have extended time on their exams.  Their exams, when possible, are made 
available in the native language. Content area teachers and the ENL teacher continue to discuss the progress and any 
academic needs of any former ELL. Language support is still provided through bilingual glossaries and dictionaries. Former ELLs 
may also attend after-school ENL classes to help them prepare for Regents exams and for homework assistance.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 Instructional plan for ELLs identified as having special needs: Eligible ELLs who are identified as having special needs receive a 
paraprofessional who provides daily academic assistance. Various scaffolding techniques are regularly implemented to help 
these students achieve academic excellence. Lessons are created by the ENL teacher and content area teachers that target 
both the student's strengths  to build upon and their areas of weakness. ELLs having special needs are included in all aspects of 
our school, including our ENL classes. Needs are met according to the parameters of each student's IEP. There are no ENL 
students at ACPCE whose IEP require bilingual services. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Eligible ELLs who are identified as having special needs receive a paraprofessional who provides daily academic assistance. 
Various scaffolding techniques are regularly implemented to help these students achieve academic excellence. Lessons are 
created by the ENL teacher and content area teachers that target both the student's strengths  to build upon and their areas of 
weakness. ELLs having special needs are included in all aspects of our school, including our ENL classes. Needs are met 
according to the parameters of each student's IEP. There are no ENL students at ACPCE whose IEP requires bilingual services.   
The only Special Education model at our school is ICT. Students are scheduled for Resource Room for assistance in Math and 
English and to meet their IEP goals. Thus, for all their other content classes, students with IEPs are placed with their General 
Education peers. In addition, counseling sessions and extra help are scheduled during lunch periods to maximize the number of 
class periods students with IEPs are in General Education classes. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our ENL teacher pushes in to other content area classes to provide support and guidance to our ELLs. Content area teachers 
receive specialized training on working with ELLs. These workshops provide our non-licensed ENL teachers with specific 
strategies in differentiating instruction to meet their specific needs. ELLs are afforded the same opportunities as non-ELLs to 
participate in all school programs, including college trips. Two different after-school models are provided to our ENL students. 
There are after-school classes for an hour and a half a day three days a week for extra help in content classes for all high school 
Regents classes. There are three-hour classes three days a week for junior high students. The students receive one hour of 
homework help, one hour of test prep, and one hour of recreation. All classes are offered only in English.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

New Common Core-aligned textbooks  are being used in the ENL class. Common planning meetings allow for the ENL and 
content teachers to meet and discuss supports, strategies, and specific student needs.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

There are no plans to discontinue any programs or services. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All students in our school may attend after-school classes and participate in any sports, school activities,  or student 
government. Students receive letters that are distributed to the student body regarding any special activities. These letters are 
discussed in the ENL class to ensure student comprehension. Parents also received phone calls, messages, and letters 
describing after-school programs. Two different after-school models are provided to our ENL students. There are after-school 
classes for an hour and a half a day three days a week for extra help in content classes for all high school Regents classes. 
There are three-hour classes four days a week for junior high students. The students receive one hour of homework help, one 
hour of test prep, and one hour of recreation. All classes are offered only in English.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All the classrooms as at ACPCE have access to Smart-boards and laptops. There are ENL Common Core aligned textbooks used 
in each of the classes. Pearson titles include Edge, Milestones,  Reading Adventures. Gateway to Science and to Social Studies 
are used to support content science and social studies classes. The classroom library has books from a variety of genres across 
a range of reading proficiencies. Many books in our library have accompanying C.D's so the students may listen and read. 
Videos that accompany the Reading Adventures books provide additional content to each thematic unit. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Bilingual dictionaries and glossaries are supplied. School letters to parents are translated into the preferred language as 
indicated on the students' HLIS.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Materials used are appropriate to both the child's age and level of English proficiency.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
All the classrooms as at ACPCE have access to smartboards and laptops. There are ENL Common Core aligned textbooks used in 
each of the classes. Pearson titles include Edge, Milestones,  Reading Adventures. Gateway to Science and to Social Studies are 
used to support content science and social studies classes. The classroom library has books from a variety of genres across a 
range of reading proficiencies. Many books in our library have accompanying CDs so the students may listen and read. Videos 
that accompany the Reading Adventures books provide additional content to each thematic unit. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
There are currently no activities offered for newly enrolled ELLs. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Our school offers Spanish, including advanced level and AP. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Our school does not offer a dual langauge program at this time.  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All teachers of ELLs attend professional development workshops in ESL methodology throughout the course of the year. 
Among these workshops are ELA Regents Support for ELLs, Differentiated Instruction for ELLs, Strategies for Success of 
Secondary ELLs, and Targeting and Identifying SIFE. Information acquired at trainings and workshops by our ENL coordinator 
(teacher) and/or Assistant Principal is shared with all other teachers through brochures and faculty meetings. Prior to the 
school year commencing, our Assistant Principal attended a workshop on the new ELL regulations and turn-keyed the 
information to relevant staff. 
All personnel who work with ELLs will attend mandated Professional Development at ACPCE. The Professional Development 
will be conducted by the ENL instructor and ENL supervisor.  The goal for instructors is to better prepare content area teachers 
to provide points of entry through scaffolding in their lessons. The goal for support staff is to understand the unique 
educational needs and challenges of ELLs who may lack not only language skills, but may have an interrupted or a lack of 
formal education.  Support of ELLs is also discussed at common planning time which is attended by teachers, principals, and 
guidance counselors. Attendance at PD is recorded through sign in sheets and official records will be kept in each teacher's file. 
An official letter will be given to each instructor and staff member upon completion of the 7.5 hours (10 hours for Special 
Education teachers).   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Prior to the beginning of the school year, the ENL and freshman educators meet to discuss incoming freshman ELLs. Areas of 
concern are anticipated and former or current ELLs who are upper-class men are assigned an incoming student buddy to 
contact and check in on within the first two weeks of school. Counselors receive training on helping ELLs transition, i.e. the 
high school application process utilizing DOE's translation services and/or  interpreters as needed. 
All teachers at ACPCE receive a minimum of 7.5 hours of ELL training. The teachers are trained in the Balanced Literacy 
Workshop model so that they will be able to implement reading and writing strategies in every lesson in every subject area. 
Content are teachers are introduced to textbooks and books that are appropriate for English Language Learners, and effective 
methods of teaching vocabulary in all content areas are taught in the training sessions. Science and math teachers collaborate 
to create an interdisciplinary curriculum that would be appropriate for ELLs based on the information and resources acquired 
in the training sessions. In addition, the trainings offer teachers opportunities to learn about students' cultural backgrounds 
and how these can be drawn upon as a resource in the classroom and in their lessons. Professional Development records are 
kept in the Principal's office. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent

Parental involvement in the programs and activities is critical to the success of the programs and the children. At PTA meetings 
and at workshops created specifically for parents of ELLs, assistance is provided to parents of children served by the school, as 
appropriate, in understanding their rights and choices as parents of an ELL, the State's academic content and achievement 
standards, the state and local academic assessments, as well as alternate assessments, how to monitor their child's progress, 
and how to communicate and work with educators. Bilingual faculty will be on hand for interpretation and any materials 
disseminated will be available in the home languages of our ELL population.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

 The school provides materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their children's academic 
achievement, such as literacy training and using technology. Workshops such as evening computer classes and immigration 
and citizenship issues are offered. During PTA meetings, the guidance staff explains to parents the requirements for graduation 
and how to evaluate each individual child's progress. 
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
Our ELLs in junior high are also offered after-school classes to prepare them for their state exams and to develop their language 
and literacy skills. 
The ELLs also participate in three field trips a year to zoos or museums. Lessons are created around the trips to use the experience 
to develop language skills.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Joan Mosely, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The language data is collected through a number of means. Upon entering the Academy of College Preparation 
and Career Readiness (ACPCE), the parents of ELLs fill out the Home Language Survey. The home language data is 
recorded in ATS and on the emergency blue contact cards. Our ESL teacher is aware of any home language needs 
and shares this information with the content area teachers , administration, and support staff. The home 
languages of the ELLs at ACPCE are Spanish, Haitian Creole, French, Arabic, Bangla, and Fulani and are noted when 
the student first registered at ACPCE. There are faculty members who speak Spanish, French, and Haitian Creole 
who can provide translation and interpretation services. There are faculty members on the Erasmus Hall 
Educational Campus who can provide interpretation and translation in Arabic. For Fulani and Bangla, ACPCE needs 
to contact the NYC DOE's translation office or use an outside vendor. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

If parents indicate their desire to receive school notices in their home language, translated versions of notices are 
made available. Bilingual report cards are available. Interpretation can be made available at parent teacher 
conferences or at PA meetings. Signage at the school informs parents that language services are available. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

The Translation and Interpretation Unit distributes multilingual posters to all DOE public schools and district offices 
throughout the City at the beginning of each school year. These posters are displayed in a highly visible location. 
These posters provide LEP parents instruction on where and how to obtain interpretation services. Additionally, we 
also access critical translation and interpretation informational flyers for parents from the DOE's Intranet. These flyers 
are also conspicuously posted in our school.  

The DOE makes available to parents the Parents’ Bill of Rights and A Parent’s Guide to Special Education in the 
covered languages. Both documents make parents aware of their rights to languages services. These documents are 
distributed to parents at the beginning of each school year and can also be accessed on the DOE’s website 
(www.schools.nyc.gov).  

At ACPCE, there are school staff members that are able to provide oral interpretation services in Haitian Creole, 
Spanish, Arabic, and French. For more distinct languages such as Fulani and Bangla, external vendors are hired. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?
