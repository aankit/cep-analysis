Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

BASE is a community of learners and designers who challenge each other to reflect, exchange ideas and create a 
better, more just world. 

  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Students at BASE study computer science all four years, as a core discipline. We are one of the new generation of 
Career and Technical Education (CTE) schools: we don’t separate vocational training from college readiness, and BASE 
students graduate ready for 4-year institutions or go directly into the workforce as entry-level programmers. The CS 
curriculum asks students to explore the essential questions of the field, trying out different areas such as 
programming, mobile app design and game development.  

The core of instruction at BASE across all content areas is challenge-based learning: asking our students to confront 
meaningful, authentic problems pulled from industry and the disciplines. Our learning framework is based on design 
thinking, a problem-solving methodology our students (and staff!) use to work through challenges in all disciplines, 
from computer science to ELA to math. Across every content area, students learn to engage deeply in context and 
empathize with their audience and users, define unclear questions and identify parameters, prototype and test 
possible solutions, and communicate their ideas to relevant audiences. Tasks and units across every discipline align 
with this process explicitly, allowing our students to see connections across content areas and ways of thinking. 

Our most important partnership is with iMentor, a college readiness program that teaches students to understand 
themselves and prioritize their development. All students are matched with a mentor with whom they email weekly 
to discuss goals and long-term plans.  

Beginning in 2018-19, BASE is an educational option school, and as such the population we work with is the one that 
selects us rather than vice versa. We have students from every zip code in the Bronx; BASE students have 10 different 
languages spoken at home, and about 75% of our incoming class in 2017 qualifies for free or reduced price lunch – 
this is a similar demographic to the rest of the school.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The only population of note is students with IEPs, who comprise approximately 26% of our population in 2017-18. This 
is notable in that it is high even for the Bronx, which has the highest percentage of students with IEPs of any borough 
in the city.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The area of the Framework for Great Schools in which BASE made the most progress in 2017-18 is Supportive 
Environment; requests for student-led mediations were more than double those of the previous year, to about 25%.  

We have several key areas of focus for 2018-19, including Algebra Regents exam passing rates and attendance.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Student achievement in ninth grade is a major need for us, and we will particularly focus on Algebra I, including the 
Regents exam. Over 78% of our two most recent incoming classes (students in cohorts U and V) came to BASE having 
scored below or well below grade level on their 8th grade math exam, and 75% percent are below or well below 
grade level in reading. 

 

Many of our 9th graders have struggled to pass the Algebra Regents exam; in 2017-18 our passing rate was just below 
50%. We also know that 9th graders are struggling to earn credits in Algebra, with passing rates about 5 percentage 
points below that of other areas.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
As a result of a revised sequence and curriculum, by June 2019, 75% of rising 10th graders will have passed the Common 
Core Algebra I exam.

strategies your school will implement to achieve the 
identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools 
element, including:

 

development, and/or systems and structures 
needed to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other 
high-need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

In 2018-19 we are changing the structure of our 9th grade 
Algebra program, so that the majority of students will take 
two Algebra courses (4 credits) as 9th graders and take the 
exam after their first year at BASE. Critical to success is the 
curriculum planning and ongoing communication between 
the four primary teachers of the curriculum, and the way 
students are exposed to two sets of interrelated concepts 
simultaneously in two different courses. We are building in 
significant planning time this summer for this work, as well as 
throughout the school year.  

 

Collaborative inquiry process in 2018-19 is one major pillar of 
this plan, as all four of these teachers sit on the 9th grade 
team and will be meeting twice weekly to discuss process, 
identify students who are struggling and identify supports to 
meet students' needs.  

 

All department teams, including the math department, will 
also continue to develop and hone the use of our periodic 
assessment model using in-house assessments aligned to 
school-wide math focus standards. Common assessments will 
be given periodically over the year and teams of teachers will 
look for evidence of growth and gaps in student work and 
teacher practice in order to make adjustments that support 
our lowest performing students, including students with IEPs 
and ELLs.  

 

All Algebra I 
teachers, including 
general ed and 
special ed teachers 
will participate in 
the inquiry teams, 
as well as activities 
related to 
understanding the 
common 
assessment data. 
Teams will be 
facilitated by lead 
teachers and APs. 

Departmental 
and grade-
specific 
inquiry teams 
will focus on 
a cohort of 
20 students 
outside of 
the school’s 
sphere of 
success. This 
group will 
focus on 
students with 
IEPs and 
students in 
the lowest 
third.

Students will receive additional math support and exam 
preparation in after-school settings. These will include weekly 
peer tutoring and, for a small number of students with the 
greatest challenges, weekly one-on-one tutoring with a 
science teacher. Students in this second group will be 
matched with the tutor for the full year, and their progress 
will be monitored closely by the tutor and the School 
Implementation Team.  

Algebra teachers will participate in professional learning 
workshops. These workshops focus on the discipline-specific 
nature of literacy in a math classroom, and ways to support 
students engaging with scientific texts and ideas. Professional 
learning opportunities will be off-site and provided by 
Department of Education-approved organizations.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
At BASE, all learning revolves around the context of community. Teachers work with every student to set academic 
goals in each class, and the Seminar (advisory) class helps students make connections across their academic classes, 
get to know each other and develop post-graduation plans. Students’ senior project require students to take on an 
issue that is directly related to a community they care about and use design thinking and software engineering to 
work toward a meaningful solution. In order to engage students in rigorous academic content, we believe we must 
demonstrate purpose that is deeply tied to community, and engage students with curricula and tasks that are relevant 
and responsive to our students' various backgrounds. Our school culture is heavily influenced by these beliefs, and we 
have begun to engage in staff-wide learning on culturally responsive pedagogy and examining inherent bias, both 
personal and structural.  

Strengths: 

 

Seminar (BASE’s advisory program) is a core component of each grade; every student is in one, and the 
curriculum is developmental  

  93% of students on our last published LES have positive responses in the Cultural Awareness and Inclusive 

Classroom Instruction category.  

Needs: 

  The school-wide passing rate in term 2 2017-18 was about 74%.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
As a result of an ongoing professional learning focus on Culturally Responsive Education, in order to decrease the gap 
between our actual course passing rate and our school target passing rate of 90%, by June of 2019 the school-wide 
passing rate across all departments will be up 6% to 80%.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: 

 

From 2015-16 and 2016-17 our CC Algebra Regents passing rate increased by 14 points, from 47% to 61% in 
2016-17.  

  Collaborative inquiry is a core component of the school's culture: all teachers meet twice weekly to look at 

student and teacher work and to make instructional decisions based on that information, including the math 
team, who have focused on problem-solving as a department-wide focus. 

Needs: 

  Despite commitment to a shared vision of strong instruction, observations show that teaching practices are 

not coherent across grades or within departments.  

  Over 78% of our two most recent incoming classes (students in cohorts U and V) came to BASE having scored 

below or well below grade level on their 8th grade math exam. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
As a result of shifting our collaborative inquiry process from departmental teams to grade teams in order to develop 
stronger shared practices with the range of students, by June of 2019, 60% of students with IEPs will achieve a college 
readiness score of 75 and above on the ELA Regents exam; this amounts to a 10% increase from previous years.

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

 

In 2018-19 each department will implement our school-wide 
literacy plan, developed in 2016-17 by a team of teachers and 
administrators that emphasizes the importance of supporting 
literacy (reading, writing, discussion) within each discipline. The 
plan gives tools and structures to teachers and teacher teams to 
bring literacy to the forefront of classrooms, with the 
development of specific interventions and strategies appropriate 
for each discipline. 

 

The six pillars of the plan are:

Using the collaborative inquiry structure, grade teams will work 
to develop two-pronged plans for literacy development: First, 
teams will promote strong literacy-across-the-curriculum 
instructional practices and cultural emphases; second, teams will 
explore and enhance instruction in discipline-specific literacy 
practices. Each team will work with a cohort of students, and 
these cohorts will comprise the full range of learners, including 
students in the lowest third, students with IEPs, English 
Language Learners, and high-performing students.  

Dedicated professional development (weekly whole-school 
meetings and collaborative inquiry) with a focus on literacy-

program, developed by the School Implementation Team, 
identifies a small group of students with the highest needs in 
math and literacy and works with them each week to develop 
foundational skills.  

 

Grade-specific inquiry teams will use a research-proven 
collaborative inquiry approach, including identifying school-wide 
groups and subgroups, targeting skill needs, developing 
instructional interventions such as problem-solving methods and 
a focus on literacy and reading in math, and assessing 
effectiveness in growth in established cycles of inquiry. Two full 
cycles of inquiry will conclude by examining the school-wide 
conditions of learning, and teams will make recommendations 
for school-wide instructional practices or structural 
modifications to promote student achievement.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

BASE's 2017-18 4-year graduation rate is approximately 66%; while this is still above the borough average, it is a 
dramatic decrease from our 2016-17 rate of 78%.  

We will address several needs in order to bring the graduation rate back up, including better identification earlier in 
the year of students who are struggling to succeed and are at risk of not graduating; below-target credit earning in 
courses (addressed in section 5A, above), and better programming to promote choice, engagement and appropriate 
supports for all students.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

As a result of a reorganization of teacher leadership roles, by June 2019 BASE's graduation rate will increase 14% (from 
66% to 80%).

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

 

Full analysis by school leaders and the guidance team of the 
previous two cohorts' graduation successes and challenges, 
including demographic analysis, to understand which students in 
upcoming cohorts are at risk for not graduating. This information 
will be shared with grade teams, who will develop action plans 
and an inquiry focus that especially focuses on students 
historically at risk.  

We will use the results of the analysis to inform grade-team 
inquiry work, including helping identify which students should be 
a part of inquiry focus groups. We are also implementing a new 
model of inquiry, in which we invite students and families to 
participate with teachers in the inquiry process, so that teachers 
will regularly interview students about their experiences and 
what is leading to success and struggle.

supervisors, and supervisors will target professional learning 
around areas of success and challenge for teachers regarding 
student engagement.  

New models in STEM areas to support students in areas where 
they have traditionally struggled (this is for future cohorts, but 
will have a strong impact on future graduation rates). In Algebra, 
we are condensing the majority students’ math tracks to a 1-
year/4-credit sequence, so that more students will be able to 
reach advanced math in their 3rd and 4th years at BASE. In Living 
Environment we are creating sections of a 2-year/4-credit 
sequence for students who need additional support to pass the 
exam and earn their credits.

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
All teachers at BASE are highly qualified or on their way to becoming highly qualified, and ongoing professional 
development (weekly whole-school and collaborative inquiry teams) will provide high quality professional 
development aligned to Danielson and supporting teacher goals for growth. Historically, we have a low turnover rate 
of teachers at BASE. We ensure that early career teachers have significant support, including mentoring and an early-
career teacher group, as well as added focus from supervisors. More experienced teachers are active participants in 
our collaborative inquiry program, which involves action research.

The decision process for BASE’s assessment program includes the voice of virtually every teacher on the team. Several 
structures are in place to ensure this is the case.  

 

In 2016-17 BASE’s assessment plan integrates student mastery of multiple focus standards in literacy and in 
problem solving. These focus standards have been selected by departments, and the rubrics for mastery will 
be developed in our Collaborative Inquiry teams, which are departmental teams that meet twice weekly, led 
by member of the school's Inquiry Leadership Team.  

  Periodic assessments for students that measure mastery of these focus standards will be developed by our 

Professional Learning Committee, a group that meets twice weekly and comprises teachers and school 
leaders. 

  Teachers use time in twice-weekly meetings to look at student work and student data from these assessments 

and plan academic interventions for students who are struggling. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. BASE , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

BASE will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESSA); 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The assessment tool that BASE uses to assess the early literacy skills for our ELL students are varied throughout the year. The 
data that is collected from these assessments is used to inform the school’s staff and effectively create instructional plans, 
including developing culturally responsive curriculum, to integrate learning for ELL students. The data that has been collected 
from various sources, including the RLAT and recent ELL measurement scores have concluded that there are ELL students 
ranging from Entering to Commanding. This data informs both staff and administration on how to conduct the most effective 
instructional plan. English Language Learners are directly supported in core classes through a push-in method, while educators 
receive support in terms of professional development, conferencing discussions and regular communication with the ENL 
support teacher.  English Language Learners are identified as candidates for our one-on-one tutoring program through teacher 
observation forms, interviews with students and families provide them with After this data is collected, the ESL teacher and

core subject teacher conference and reflect on practices within the classroom to best support English Language Learners based 
on the data collected through various sources previously mentioned.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

In order to support educators in the development of culturally responsive and responsible curricula, our full staff meetings are 
geared towards developing empathy for all of our diverse learners, ELLs included. The creation of empathetic assessments 
follow the professional and personal development and adult learning that our teachers embark on. The ENL teacher is a 
member of the SIT, which has organized a yearly event known as the Diverse Learners' Summit. In the first year of this Summit, 
which was a professional development opportunity for all staff members during Chancellor's Day, the ENL teacher was able to 
facilitate multiple workshops that support teachers in their practice of responding to the needs of English Language Learners.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our ESL programs are correlated to the success of our students in English language acquisition and development 
of English language skills. Many Regents examinations are considered when evaluating the success of ELL students. The 
directly correlated success on Regents exams can provide information of the amount of success students are achieving 
throughout Regents classes. Documents and Assessments related to the Measures of Student Learning are also used to 
evaluate the success of programs for ELL students at B.A.S.E.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once summative data has been gathered, structures that are put into place are as follows: the SIT is an essential component in 
addressing interventions for diverse learners and particularly English Language Learners. Full staff meetings are also a place 
where interventions are addressed. In terms of full staff meetings and break-out groups, we focus on modifying curriculum to 
create more responsiveness to our students needs, and particularly to the needs of our ELLs. In SIT, we work through protocols 
to address interventions for struggling ELLs. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
There is much data to enforce the instruction for ELL students, which includes the New York State English as a Second 
Language Achievement Test as well as Assessments from the Measures of Student Learning for New York City Public Schools. 
The Bronx Academy for Software Engineering uses this data to engage English Language Learners in instructional programs for 
all of their content classes. For example, many ELL students are proficient when it comes to the language and use of 
Computers and Technology.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Data taken from the Lab-R and NYSESLAT examinations for English Language Learners has revealed students on all levels of 
English language acquisition. There are two students who are considered to be at the entering level of English language 
development, with 5 students at the emerging level, 8 students at the transitioning level and the remaining 14 students at an 
expanding level, making in total 29 English Language Learners at B.A.S.E. across the four grades. All students across the board 
require English language development in both reading and writing skills, whereas speaking and listening skills are profound 
and higher rated from examination scores.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 
As an integral part of the SIT, the ENL teacher uses this space to analyze data with the members of the SIT and draw 
conclusions about that data in terms of the supports necessary for ELLs. We use this information to target particular students 
who are struggling ELLs and have them become a part of our tutoring program, or to be matched up with a particular higher-
level ELL who can continue to support them. In coordination with our collaborative inquiry teams, the ENL teacher sits on the 
Inquiry Leadership team, and provides opportunities for representatives from each of the disciplines to engage with empathy 
work in accordance with the progress of our ELLs.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction for English Language Learners is delivered in various ways. Push-in, pull-out, collaborative teaching and 
self-contained diversified instruction are all aspects of the Freestanding ESL program at B.A.S.E. Students’ ESL services 
are also infused in the socio-emotional and academic support class known as Seminar. Current English Language 
Learners and their peers are supported in language development and support  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here:    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           The school takes appropriate measures to ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided to ENL 
students. The ENL teacher is responsible for creating the schedule for ENL students in alignment with the Special Education 
requirements for support.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Courses at BASE are delivered specifically in English with little to no support in the student’s first language. The ESL instructor 
varies instruction for leveled English Language learners. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   ELL students are appropriately evaluated throughout the year in their native languages. Initially we can support students in 
this way by administering specific Regents examinations in the native language. There are also support systems in-house 
where students are able to have conversations in their native languages with teachers who also speak the native language. 
Finally, ELL students whom are at different levels of English language learning are paired with each other to support in English 
language acquisition skills. Our teachers are currently being trained to translate instructional materials into the native 
language for ELL students that need this support.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. SIFE students have a fellow native language speaker that we use as a buddy to help the student become adjusted to our 
school. We try to provide a staff member that speaks the student’s native language to mentor our SIFE and assist in their 
adjustment to the school.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

b. For Newcomers, we use many of the same strategies listed above. We use a buddy system and a staff member to serve as a 
mentor. In addition, we provide additional tutoring to support our ELLs with under three years in the US. Tutoring is available 
after-school.  
c. ELLs  with 4 – 6 years of service are also provided tutoring (after-school). These ELLs receive extra help during their content 
area classes from one-to-one support from their teachers. We also utilize significant cooperative learning where these 
students have the support of other studetns in their cooperative groups.  
d. Long term ELLs we focus on utilizing scaffolds that will develop the skills that these students need to be successful on the 
CCLS aligned assessments and the NYSESLAT exam.  
e. Former ELLs receive  additional tutoring (after-school) and receive accommodations on assessments for up to 2 years.  
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The use of leveled and differentiated texts for classroom accounts are used to access the academic success of English Language 
acquisition and development.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
BASE focuses on scheduling students who are SWDs into the Least Restrictive Environment based on stduent’s IEPs. We 
believe that the Least Restrictive Environment will result in greater student achievement and a higher percentage of students 
achieving at profiency on the NYSESLAT.  Students are programmed according to IEPs based on their IEPs. We use an 
Integrated Co-teach model to support the implementation of LRE (Least Restrictive Environment).  These students are further 
programmed based on their NYSESLAT proficiency level for ESL. Our ESL teacher and Special Education team look at the 
curriculum with a focus on providing differentiated supports into units and lessons for our students to achieve success.  We 
constantly assess and meet as a team to look at our student’s work through team meetings as well as at our SIT (School 
Implementation Team).  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Paste reThere are specific targeted intervention programs for ELL students in all content area classes which include; ELA, Math, 
Global History, Physics and Computer Science. Specifically in ELA and Math courses, ELL subgroups are not distinguished in the 
intervention process. ELA and Math are specific content area classes that require early intervention programs for ELL students. 
The intervention programs aligned with BASE determine the needs of ELL students in which to best support them in English 
language acquisition. sponse to question here:    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Throughout the year there are services provided in order for the school to continuously create new programs and improve 
existing programs for the school’s ELL community.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

At the current time no programs or services for ELLs will be discontinued. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All of our ELLs have equal opportunity to all school related programs. This includes clubs, activities, and tutoring services. 
Robotics club is a club at BASE that allows students to participate even if they have challenges in the English Language. As do 
all clubs at BASE, Robotics club offers a high level learning environment which allows students to develop language acquisition 
skills and needs. Curricular activities in school include the iMentor program in which students are matched with a Mentor and 
build and gain a trusting and long lasting relationship with through their four years in High School. All students are asked to 
participate in the iMentor program and all of our ELL students fully participate and are matched with mentors. This activity

engages English Language Learners in conversations through email and in person and help students to develop communicative 
skills.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We have purchased bi-lingual language dictionaries, materials including textbooks that are Common Core aligned to provide 
rigor for our ELLs. We have Smart Boards and laptops that allow our teachers to differentiate material. The computers have 
translation software and teachers find pictures to show on the SmartBoards to provide a visual image for our ELLs.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support in the free-standing ESL program is delivered minimally throughout the school. ESL students have 
native language support through technology that we utilize.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
All required services, support and resources provided to ELLs are age and grade-level appropriate. We offer after school 
programs and Saturday programs to our ELLs. Our ELLs have equal opportunities with all other students to all of our resources 
and enjoy the benefit of our library media center, computer labs, and extra curricular activities which include video 
production, music studio, fine arts, and culinary arts. our ESL students with disabilities receive speech therapy, physical 
therapy, occupational therapy, and counseling services as indicated in their IEPs. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We have purchased bi-lingual language dictionaries, materials including textbooks that are Common Core aligned to provide 
rigor for our ELLs. We have Smart Boards and laptops that allow our teachers to differntiate material. The computers have 
translation software and teachers find pictures to show on the SmartBoards to provide a visual image for our ELLs. We also 
hold a building-wide student extracurricular activity in which student representatives from all schools work together to build 
inter-school relationships. T 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Specific activities that support ELLs includes for newly enrolled ELL students, we have an orientation during the summer that is 
delivered by the guidance counselor and AP. Orientation involves an overview of our school-wide programs, tour of the school, 
and a visit to their classrooms. We offer counseling for many of students to adjust to our school. In addition, we have a 
mentorship program that involves our staff who support our students. Finally, throughout the year, whenever a new student is 
enrolled, the AP and guidance counselors will give an orientation.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Language electives that are offered to ELL students come in the form of support in specific modalities of English Language 
acquisition skills as well as foreign language support. ELA extra supportive classes come in the form of diverse courses, which 
support reading and writing modalities in the English Language. Foreign language classes are also offered as credit for ELL 
students.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional development for personnel at B.A.S.E. is met mainly through two modalities. ELL representatives of the school 
attend ELL liaison meeting with the Central office. These meetings help teachers of ELLs better understand requirements for 
ELL teachers. ELL teachers from the school attend meetings in which they are the representative for the school. These 
meetings are attended in order to review and become familiar with different modes of teaching ELL students, which include 
the use of technology in the classroom.  
Professional development is offered in many ways to teachers of ELLs which support ELL students in all of the content area 
classes. Collaborative Inquiry design leads focus towards strengths and needs for ELL students as well as the instructional 
support that is necessary for ELL students. Designated professional development after school focuses on informational 
sessions on how to Design Challenges using Thinking By Design in order to best support ELLs in content area classes. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
It is necessary to provide staff to assist ELL students with the transition from middle to high school. Support like this comes in 
the form of exercises and discussions in Seminar classes. Professional development sessions are used in order to help staff 
understand connections between cognitive and non-cognitive skills in adolescents and most specifically to ELL students when 
thinking about these aspects.  
Staff members will go through thorough presentations including Professional Development presentations and activities to 
empathize with English Language Learners and the environment in which they are presented with; coming into the country 
and almost forcefully learning a language that everyone around them speaks. Training for staff members will also include 
direct experience to working with ELLs in classroom setting with the ESL teacher to guide. At each Professional Development 
and teacher meeting throughout the year, attendance will be taken for teachers and staff to ensure that they are receiving the 
minimum 7.5 hours of ELL training. Special Education teachers will receive extra time during after school hours and meetings 
set to the side where Special Education and ELL teacher/s cultivate an extensive learning environment and work with one 
another to ensure full understanding of each other’s disciplines.    
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL teacher as well as the parent coordinator consistently reach out to parents of ELLs to ensure that all parents and 
guardians have the correct information and that the school is aware of concerns of the family. At the beginning of the school 
year, the ENL coordinator reaches out to families as a support as well as reaching out to the families of students who are new 
to the school.  

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parent involvement for ELL students at B.A.S.E. includes a number of specific activities that foster our ELL parental 
involvement. We have held a number of open house nights at the school in order for families of ELL students to meet all staff 
members and create connections with one another. Secondly, we plan activities that include but are not limited to activities 
that foster parent learning and development of the English Language. Another activity that we plan for parents of ELL students 
is to help them to understand the core content classes that their student is learning and how these classes have specific

impacts on the development of the English language for ELL students. We have also included a yearly Diverse Learners night, 
where parents and families are invited to come to the school and work with other families through transformative practices 
that foster community building and community relationships.  
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
The Bronx Academy for Software Engineering (BASE) is in it's fourth year of recognition as a New York Public City High School.  We 
have created a school environment in which our core values; Understanding Self, Valuing Diversity, Creating Dialogue and Taking 
Action, are present in the programs, services and instructional aspects of the school. These core values have been created to foster 
an environment for all types of students who come from varied backgrounds to communicate with one another. The programs and 
services for ELL students have been defined and also continue to be modified throughout the school year using data collected from 
various sources.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Benjamin Grossman, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The school will assess the needs for translation through Parent Language Survey. The survey along with other 
documents such as the Emergency Contact information will provide results indicating what language the parents 
would like to receive written and oral language. Following the results of the Language survey and Emergency 
Contact Card, the school provides written materials such as newsletters, surveys, postings, etc. in Spanish to the 
parents whom speak Spanish. DOE notices such as booklets and pamphlets are requested by the school to be 
delivered in Spanish as well as French and Bengali, for the parents and families who speak these languages.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

By ensuring that all parents and families of students at BASE have their needs for translation and interpretation met, 
the school holds various informational meetings and provides settings for this type of conversation. This year, BASE is 
offering parents of English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities to attend a conference at the school 
regarding the rights and responsibilities that these parent subgroups have. Written and oral translation will be 
provided to parents first by school personnel in Spanish. For languages such as Bengali and French, BASE will provide 
written and oral translation services through the Translation and Interpretation Unit Department of the DOE weeks in 
advance in order to have the documents prepared and ready  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the
