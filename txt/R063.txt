Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our School Mission: 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Marsh Avenue Expeditionary Learning School (MAELS) was founded on an understanding and encouragement of the 
diverse learning needs and styles of all students. We are committed to providing a learning environment which is 
conducive to developing the unique intellectual, social, physical and emotional potential of each child. An essential 
component of our vision rests in our belief that we must be responsive to the unique learning style of every child. We 
believe that all students can learn when instruction is responsive to the variety of intelligences students bring to the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

classroom. The goal of our dedicated faculty is to maximize the learning experience through instruction tailored to 
each student’s needs. Equal emphasis on character and academics, a caring and dedicated team of teachers in a small 
setting, “hands-on” instruction, Outward Bound adventure, and Expeditionary Learning give our students the 
opportunity to move deeper into the curriculum at every level.  

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

As an expeditionary learning school, we have implemented crew as a structure that puts into practice what our 
school’s mission and ideology promise: namely, a culture and community of trust, respect, and support for students 
as they endeavor to grow intellectually, socially, physically, emotionally, and artistically. One of the many measures of 
a school’s quality is its cohesion. Nowhere is this more evident than in crew, a small group of students assigned to a 
crew leader when they enter as students in sixth grade. Throughout their three years at MAELS, students remain in 
the same crew and thereby experience the ups and downs of ‘ tweenhood together, safely situated in a nurturing and 
supportive environment that feels like a second family. Crew leaders, who are teachers in the building, serve as each 
student’s primary academic and emotional support communicating with other teachers and family members, 
attending events that are important for that child, hosting student-led conferences, and generally devoting 
themselves to that child’s emotional and academic well-being in ways not frequently encountered in other schools. 
Crew meets twice a week and works towards a culminating ritual known as “passages.” This can best be compared to 
a rite of passage, in that it offers each student the opportunity to review and reflect upon how each year here at 
MAELS uncovered deeper revelations about the student’s abilities, proclivities, and moral imperatives. Passages are 
conducted in May and are performed before a panel of teachers, family, and community guests. 

It is here in Crew that we first introduced our latest initiative, entitled Habits of Success. Formally acknowledging their 
own work habits is a new practice at MAELS and promotes a useful way for students to motivate themselves. This 
initiative is designed to provide opportunities for students to track their progress towards developing individual 
responsibility, maturity, and integrity. Following its introduction in Crew, this structure migrated to each and every 
classroom and is visited on a daily basis. Teachers have already worked to embed these principles within their 
classrooms in an effort to make them truly practicable and therefore habitual. Habits of success focus upon 
perseverance, commitment to high quality, accountability (“no excuses”) and time management, and development of 
all four qualities and their application are tracked by teachers and student-practitioners alike. This also aligns to and 
supports the DOE’s college and career readiness expectations explicitly the “academic and personal behaviors which 
are the learning habits and skills that support academic readiness and include non-cognitive, socio-emotional qualities 
that support resiliency, and college/career persistence”. 

As a school community one of our school’s biggest strengths is the collaborative learning communities that our 
teachers and administrative staff have formed over the past few years. Due to our successful teamwork, we have 
been able to fully align our ELA and Mathematics curriculum and task work to ensure alignment to the Common Core 
Learning Standards. We have also tailored our content area teaching to incorporate the ELA Common Core Learning 
Standards and Instructional Shifts. Teachers meet to analyze and utilize data to notice trends in student work and 
make informed decisions on how to meet the individual needs of our students. As a result our school has made gains 
in the number of students performing on levels 3 and 4 on the New York State ELA Assessment. Last year 66% of our 
students met or exceeded standards on the ELA State Exam and 51% met or exceeded standards on the New York 
State Math Assessment; this number does not include our students who took the algebra regent where 100% of our 
students passed . In addition our school has made Annual Yearly Progress for all students and sub groups in ELA and 
Mathematics as determined by New York State.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.

Approximately 23% of MAELS students have IEPs we have paraprofessionals on staff (for health, and mobility,), 
multiple sections of ICT on a grade, and one 12:1 self contained class per grade, with an enrollment of only 450 
students. Students' disabilities include ADHD, emotionally disturbed, hearing impaired, speech impaired, learning 
disabled, and other health impairments. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools that we have made the most progress during the 2017-18 school 
year have been in Rigorous Instruction and in Collaborative Teachers. Those areas will continue to be the areas of 
focus during the 2018-19 school year. 

Every year, we create a Work Plan with Expeditionary Learning. This plan guides the focus of our school wide work 
and helps us articulate a vision for the scope of the work at our school. In order for this work to remain coherent and 
focused, our instructional leadership team determines how each of the collaborative work structures at our school 
will contribute to the goal. This year, our school goal is to establish cycles of teacher inquiry/action research across all 
of the collaborative teacher groups in the school. We feel this goal, while broad in scope, will contribute to the level of 
rigorous instruction at our school.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Our 2014-2015 Quality Review data indicates that in indicators 1.1, and 1.2 our school is Well Developed. On our 
school quality guide we received a score of 87% for Rigorous Instruction. These indicators speak to how our school 
ensures that students are engaged in rigorous instruction aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and/or 
content standards, how our teachers pedagogy is based in a set of coherent beliefs around how students learn, how 
our assessments of curricula are aligned to the content and are on-going, and how the data from the assessments is 
utilized. Danielson’s Framework is utilized to give meaningful feedback to teachers so if shifts in instruction are 
needed they can be made in a timely manner to ensure quality instruction continues. Utilizing data from the New York 
State exams we continue to shift instruction to meet the diverse needs of our students. 

Teachers continually identify each student's strengths and weaknesses using available data, such as , NWEA, 
Formative/Summative assessments, as well as teacher observations and interactions with students. Teachers use 
student's summer assignment as a pre-assessment to identify the skills of their students. The analysis of this 
comprehensive data is used to propel the instructional process of creating meaningful lessons, grouping of students, 
student programs, and student placements. Meaningful and immediate shifts were made to the unit plans to meet 
the needs of the students. School leaders and teachers work collaboratively to ensure the curriculum is aligned to the 
CCLS. Unit plans are maintained and updated as needed and are kept by the teacher, department lead as well as the 
principal. School leaders and teachers have clearly defined criteria to ensure that each student meets the rigorous 
demands for promotion to the next grade. This year, we want to focus on leveraging inquiry cycles to create stronger 
classroom practices leading to higher quality student work. 

One of the components in the Framework for Great Schools is rigorous instruction. We ensure that all students 
receive rigorous instruction in all content areas and our data proves this. In the testing year 2015-2016 57% of MAELS 
students were proficient in ELA up 5% from the year prior and out scoring the city average by over 20%. Similarly in 
mathematics 55% of MAELS students were proficient, up 11% from last year and out performing the city average by 
about 13%. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019 students who performed in the lowest third in the city including general and special education students 
will improve their performance by 3% as measured by the NYS Tests.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

• Professional development will continue to be provided so all 
teachers recognize that questioning and discussion techniques 
promote higher leveled thinking in all disciplines. Teachers 
encourage students to build on each other’s responses to 
questions by responding either with a comment or a new 
question. This promotes student discussions. Teachers use open 
‐ ended questions based on DOK levels. Teachers will also be 
provided professional development around success criteria.

Through Expeditionary Learning students are involved in 
evidence based classroom protocols which focus on gathering 
and using evidence during discussion. Every teacher is a teacher 
of literacy and therefore all subject teachers have been trained 
to utilize these protocols within their classroom to foster 
cohesive instruction.  

Academic intervention services include learning support classes, 
before school tutoring, after school programs and Saturday 
Academy will continue to be offered. Students receive 
instruction in small groups and/or one to one. Research based 
strategies are consistently implemented and standard based 
assessments are used assess student progress.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Although Crew at MAELS has improved from the 2016-17 to 2017-18 school year, we still view it as an area for 
growth. In the 2018-19 school year, more work needs to be done to create both horizontal and vertical skills 
alignment. There is still variability across classrooms and grade levels; some Crews exhibit strong structures and 
planning (clear documentation), while others (based on walk-through observations) exhibit fewer clear Expeditionary 
Learning structures and practices. We also see a need to continue our “reinvigoration” of Crew, meaning to 
intentionally support MAELS staff in embracing Crew as a meaningful opportunity for students’ learning and social-
emotional growth. Although the Implementation Review rubric indicates a “4” in Crew, we perceive the need to meet 
a higher bar - one that emphasizes a) clear Crew planning across grade levels, b) consistency of shared Crew 
structures and practices, and c) increased student engagement. For us, this starts at the staff level and then transfers 
from staff to student. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, as a result of all collaborative teacher teams' planning unit and daily lesson plans to include multiple entry 
points and appropriate differentiated scaffolds and extensions for all learners, at least 80% of teachers will receive end 
of year Advance MOTP ratings of Effective or Highly Effective in components 1a, 1e and 3c, 2a, 2d, as measured by end 
of year Advance MOTP ratings.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

When the schedule changed for the 2014-15 school year, department team meetings went from happening weekly to 
happening monthly, significantly impacting the inquiry work that in which teachers were engaged. In the 2013-14 
school year, teachers actively engaged in department inquiry work, designing a question, researched strategies, 
employed those strategies, and then analyzed student work to see if the strategies had an impact on student 
achievement. In 2014-15 we implemented grade teams that met once a month. With the new schedule that teachers 
have agreed to for the 2016-17 school year, teachers will meet weekly with their departments and grades and will be 
able to engage in this work more frequently. The School Quality Snapshot indicates that teachers feel "good" about 
how well they work with each other 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, all teachers will engage in at least four cycles of inquiry work at the department team level, by analyzing 
item analysis data from the 2018 State Exams Exams, designing an inquiry question, creating an action plan, 
implementing the plan, and then analyzing student achievement results.

The average attendance at monthly PTA meetings is 10-12 people. In the Learning Environment Survey, parents are 
satisfied with the education their children are receiving, the attentiveness of the staff, and the safety of their children. 
During the 2017-18 school year, the PTA tried to incorporate guest speakers, drug awareness workshops, and other 
events to attract parents to its meetings, but many parents still do not attend. Although these meetings are 
advertised via daily announcements, flyers, email, School Messenger, the school’s website and Facebook pages, the 
outreach does not have the intended effect of increasing parental engagement.

Monthly workshops are planned for parents. These workshops 
may include, but are not limited to, areas such as: bullying, 
reading support, on-line student data reporting and data 
interpretation and analysis, etc. The Parent Coordinator will seek 
and collaborate with experts from our partnering Community 
Based Organizations or additional organizations to assist with the 
planning and facilitation of these parent workshops. Family Fun 
Nights are planned in conjunction with the School’s Leadership 
Team to encourage and improve parental involvement .  

The school will continue to publish a bi-monthly newsletter in 
order to inform parents of units of study taught within the 
curriculum on all grade levels; upcoming events including 
workshops and school functions. Each grade level will also make 
a grade specific newsletter detailing grade level expectations and 
units of study. We will continue to use eChalk as the platform for 
the school’s website which contains relevant information 
concerning the school’s curriculum and other relevant 
information. Our school’s webmaster will be responsible for 
updating the school’s website and publishing our school 
newsletter. All school notices and other communications are 
uploaded onto this website for immediate access, weekly emails 
and phone calls will be made using School Messenger, to inform 
parents of school events and programs available.  

MAELS will hold Caught being good and Student of the Month 
celebrations immediately following PTA meetings

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Marsh Avenue School for Expeditionary Learning, in compliance with the 
Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a 
parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the 
School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed 
members of the school community. 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

MAELS will support parents and families of Title I students by:

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

MAELS, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Students are assessed using a computer based program that identifies their Lexile Level. The insights that the data provides to 
us allows us to create flexible groups according to students levels. The ELL student received a level 1 on last years NYS ELA 
state test and  is reading 2 years behind grade level. This information allows our teachers to adequately plan for differentiated 
learning. During the school year we use pre and post assessments, reading inventories and performance tasks to assess our 
students for reading comprehension. In addition,   after each unit of study students take a post assessment and reteach items 
that students were not proficient in. The data shows that our ELL student is reading below grade level and need additional 
support in reading comprehension. This data has helped our school by differentiating instruction in our ELA classes. Students 
are reading books that are leveled and teachers are supporting these students by conducting guided reading lessons on a daily 
basis. According to our NYSESLAT results, most of our students are at advanced levels in proficiency. These Instructional 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

 

decisions are based on individual student need as shown through our data. Teachers use the data to modify their curriculum 
by differentiating their units based on the needs in their class. English Language Learners in the Advanced range of proficiency, 
as well as former ELLs and English Proficient students, are grouped according to independent reading levels. Small-group 
reading instruction is then provided to the students using texts within students' instructional reading level. Additionally, all 
teachers utilize students' reading levels to provide leveled content-area texts within content-area instruction.      
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

An ESL teacher was hired two days a week to provide support both in the classroom and as a pull out group service. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The administration along with the faculty look at the data and plan, assess and adjust accordingly. We use protocols for 
looking at student data during our Core Instructional Team meetings, and Collaborative Inquiry Team meetings. Workshops 
are held to show teachers how to embed the academic language development in sensory context by using visual and auditory 
aids, and  manipulatives,  to make the academic language engaging and accessible. Feedback from these workshops is used to 
plan additional professional learning opportunities for our teachers. We evaluate the success of our program based on the 
following  factors: NYSESLAT scores, the performance and progress on the  NYS ELA  Exam.   
We evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs using multiple quantitative and qualitative data points. First, every student 
in our school completes a Fountas-Pinnell leveled reading assessment at least three times per year. This assessment allows our 
teachers and school leaders to evaluate the effectiveness of our small-group leveled reading program. Students' improved 
reading proficiency as measured by these assessments is one way in which we evaluate the success of the programs provided 
to ELLs. Additionally, we examine students outcomes as measured by the NYS Math, ELA and Science tests specific to the ELL 
subgroup. We consider the percentage of students who demonstrate exemplary proficiency gains each year and use those 
results to better focus our efforts in supporting ELL students' learning. Finally, we analyze the results of the NYSESLAT 
examination each year to identify the percentage of students demonstrating proficiency and those who demonstrate at least 
one level of improvement.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Teachers present the data at grade team meetings and determine the best way to support the student(s). 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Not applicable, we are a grade 6-8 school.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
A review of the existing data indicates that ELL’s are scoring well on the Listening and Speaking portion of the NYSESLAT . 
However, the performance gains are slow in the Reading and Writing portion. This information allows our teachers to 
adquately plan for  differentiated learning. This can be attributed to the fact that English Language Learners practice speaking 
skills in all content areas throughout the school day, as well as during push-in and small-group ESL instruction. Additionally, all 
teachers incorporate cooperative learning activities into daily lessons to encourage spoken language proficiency of all 
students, especially English Language Learners.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Teachers present the data at grade team meetings and determine the best way to support the student(s).

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction is delivered through an intergrated push-in model. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

              The mandated # of instructional periods/minutes is provided according to the advanced proficiency level of the 
students by a certified ENL teacher. All students mandated to participate in the NYSESLAT exam during the current academic 
year receive ESL services during their daily program as push-in or team-teaching support. Students who enter NYSESLAT results 
within the entering proficiency will receive 360 ENL minutes with 180 minutes as standalone and 180 minutes integrated with 
ELA. Students who received NYSESLAT results in the Emerging proficiency will receive 360 minutes ENL minutes with 90 
minutes as standalone, 180 integrated with ELA and 90 in other content areas. Students who received NYSESLAT results in the 
Transitional or Expanding will receive 180 minutes of ENL with90 minutes in ELA and 90 minutes in content area. Students who 
received a Commanding results will receive 90 minutes of ENL these minutes with be in ELA and content areas. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
      To enrich language development, teachers differentiate the readings to ensure that readings are leveled and appropriate to 
the skill level of the student. Lessons are scaffolded to ensure that we move students along a continuum.  English Language 
Arts, Social Studies, Science, Mathematics, and the Arts are provided in English with ESL support.  Methods include explicit 
vocabulary instruction within the content areas, use of annotated supports and visual models, implementation of 
technological resources for presentation and response, and multiple methods of response when appropriate. Further, teachers 
provide scaffolds which provide students access to the content or critical thinking required within the curriculum in the native 
language when appropriate. Curriculum in Math, Science, Social Studies, and ELA are aligned with the CCLS and are 
collaboratively created by teachers. Teachers in Math, Science, Social Studies, and ELA utilize SmartBoard technology   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

      Each year, the home language survey provides us with information about how to evaluate students in their native language. 
The school assessment coordinator ensure that the proper ordering of tests occurs.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

        A strategic partnership with ASCD ensures that we provide effective professional development to our teachers in the area 
of differentiation.  In addition to this partnership, job-embedded professional development has been implemented. Each 
teacher received a differentiated and individualized professional development plan that addresses the teachers areas of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

weaknesses as well as builds upon the area of differentiation that the teacher exhibits strength in.  
  
        Although we currently do not have any students who fit the category, our instructional plan for SIFE (Students with 
Interrupted Formal Education) students would include building a supportive environment that responds to the immediate 
social, cultural and linguistic needs of the students. Bilingual staff members, in addition to ENL teachers,support the students. 
SIFE students would partner with peers or classmates who can support and further integrate them into their grade and school 
community.  
   
        Currently we do not have any newcomers; however our plan for this population would be on language acquisition and 
development. Students would receive  intense instruction in and out of the classroom with a focus on vocabulary 
development, sentence structure as well as conversational speech.  
  
        For students who have been in ESL for four to six years, the academic instruction builds upon the solid foundation 
acquired in previous years of English language development. We focus on further developing students’ cognitive academic 
language and vocabulary development. 
   
       Currently we  have one long term ELL  our plan includes a more personalized instructional plan. Students would be given 
additional time on tasks and a more intense program consisting of no more than 3-5 students in order to help these students 
obtain English Language Proficiency. We utilize small group instruction and modified graphic organizers, classwork 
assignments, and homework assignments are utilized to address the needs. Students are also  provided with appropriately 
modified guided notes supports, glossaries, and vocabulary instruction which appropriately address the needs of students 
within the Advanced proficiency.  
  
        Former ELLs receive testing accommodations, such as time and half and separate location. Moreover, former ELLS 
are  further  
        supported through an ongoing collaboration between ENL providers and classroom teachers which includes common 
planning time,  cultural responsiveness and continued implementation of ENL strategies  for 90 minutes per week.  
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
        Small-group instruction and student-specific scaffolding, as well as modeling and graphic organizers, are utilized to provide 
ELL-SWD students with access to the grade-level curriculum. In Social Studies and Sciece teachers provide content-area texts 
which are aligned to students' instructional reading levels in order to accelerate students' English language development but 
which also reflect the grade-level concepts being learned. Teachers strategically identify the core concepts required in each 
content area to leverage improved student outcomes and scaffold students' assessments and learning tasks in alignment with 
these decisions. Additionally, all teachers identify content-specific vocabulary and explicitly teach these target words within 
instruction in addition to content-area concepts.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The needs of our  ELL's with disabilities are met in the general education environment, which is our LRE.  ELLs identified as 
Special Education Students with special needs are in general education classroom,  Integrated Co-teaching classrooms as well 
as self-contained classroom. Our school utilizes students' IEP recommendations, as well NYS Exam data and content-area 
diagnostic assessments in order to ensure that students are placed in classroom environments which meet their diverse 
learning needs. In addition to the use of small- Our school recognizes the importance of flexible programming and uses the full 
continuum of special education services to meet students needs in the least restrictive environment.  SWDs that are in an 
integrated co-teaching classroom are scheduled to receive push in services

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The language needs of ELL students inform instruction across all content areas in several ways. In order to enhance listening, 
reading, and writing skills, all students identified as ELLs  participate in small group literacy intervention.  The literacy 
intervention focuses on differentiating instruction to meet students’ comprehension needs at their instructional reading level. 
ELLs in need of intensive Mathematics intervention participate in additional small-group enrichment during both extended day 
and after school programs. Targeted intervention programs include small group instruction in all content areas, push-in 
support by a content area teacher in all classrooms, before/after school individualized and small group tutoring, and Saturday 
academy.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are not considering any new programs for the upcoming school year.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We are not considering discontinuing any services/programs at this time.    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 All ELLs receive equal treatment and resources to the general population of our school. All ELLs participate in a comprehensive 
visual and performing Arts program which is provided within the regular instructional program. All after school clubs, music, 
art, shows, plays, and extended day instruction are open to the complete academic community. These notices are translated 
for those parents that have indicated that they prefer to have notices sent to them in another language. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All students have access to the SMART boards, laptops, and books on tape/CD.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home Language support is provided in the form of paired peers  whenever necessary. The use of technology, recordings, 
bilingual dictionaries and text also supports ELL instruction.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All students, including ELLs, are placed in grade and age-appropriate classes with their peers.  Additional resources may include 
but not limited to headphones, native language dictionaries and texts.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
All students have access to the SMART boards, laptops, and books on tape/CD.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Emphasis is placed on creating a positive home and school partnership. Communication is provided in the students' native 
language to enhance involvement in school wide activities. ELLs have the support of all school staff members. The parent 
coordinator provides 
information to the the parents of ELLs.   We offer parent workshops for newly enrolled ELLs prior to the beginning of school. 
We are also hold a "meet and greet" for the students and their parents. We schedule these activities in the last week of June 
and/or late August.      
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

All ELLs receive Spanish in grades 7and 8.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our Professional Development plan is driven by collective and individual teacher need. It was created with the intent to 
provide teachers with a cycle of continuous improvement in order to meet the needs of all our teachers. Teachers have been 
divided into three cohorts depending upon their level of implementation of differentiated instruction. These cohorts were 
created to move teachers along a continuum of growth to improve their practice which in turn impacts student  achievement.  
  
In addition to ESL support, all content area teachers incorporate ESL strategies into classroom instruction. Teachers participate 
in no fewer than 5 professional development sessions (a total of 7.5 hours) focusing upon strategies to support ELLs in 
language acquisition across content areas. Instructional staff use multiple resources, including Building Academic Vocabulary 
by John Marzano and Classroom Instruction That Works with English Language Learners by Jane D. Hill and Kathleen M. Flynn 
to improve content area instruction for ELL students in all content areas. All staff participate in professional development 
every Monday during the school year. Professional development is provided by school leaders and teacher leaders focusing 
upon: strategies for providing differentiated instruction which meets the needs of ELLs, Common Core Learning Standards, and 
strategies for supporting students in acquisition of academic vocabulary and improved reading comprehension, as well as the 
use of data to inform instruction.  
Professional development focuses upon: strategies for providing differentiated instruction which meets the needs of ELLs, 
Common Core Learning Standards, Staff also work collaboratively to implement strategies driven by the Universal Design for 
Learning in order to ensure that all students have access to curricula regardless of students' level of English proficiency. All 
instructional staff members including the principal, ESL teacher, content area teachers, guidance counselor, and Special 
Education teachers are thoroughly trained in backwards planning and models of explicit vocabulary instruction that is rooted in 
data and language need.  
  
Our PD model enables teachers to gain knowledge and expertise in DI strategies to teach ALL students.  
• New teachers receive explicit guidance and support in best practices that have proven to increase student achievement. • 
Experienced teachers have opportunities to facilitate professional development specific to their strengths and also act as 
mentors or coaches for new and/or struggling teachers.  
• Expert teachers are part of the instructional leadership team and play an integral part in the professional development at the 
inquiry and departmental level.  
• Peer observations within and across content areas empower teachers to refine their pedagogy. In addition, this also sets the 
stage for teachers to have structured dialogue about effective practice.  
• Teachers who display certain strengths in their practice (i.e. timing, effective implementation of any section of the workshop 
model, DI strategies, classroom management) turnkey their successful practices for any staff member who would like  to 
observe this practice in action. 
With respect to Jose P., records of staff members' participation in ESL professional development is maintained in the school 
professional development record.

• Carefully timed Workshop Model across disciplines.  
• Differentiated Instructional strategies which maximizes each area of the Workshop Model, including pre-assessments, 
flexible grouping, levels of questioning, small group instruction, tiered instruction, choice activities leading to choice products 
and Curriculum Compacting Classroom Environment/culture We believe that the consistency in the systems and structures we 
have in place for our students set the tone and high expectations for learning at our school. 
 • Structures in place for consistent use of Workshop Model and Accountable Talk create and support high expectations for 
student behavior and discourse through the use of Costa’s levels of questioning.  
• Celebrated student work with purposeful and meaningful feedback.  
• Display and implementation of school’s character traits; courage, collaboration, compassion, and tolerance. Assessments: 
We believe that all students can learn if we use data to tailor out instruction to meet the needs of all our students. 
Differentiated instruction drives our approach to teaching and is an expectation that can be witnessed across all content areas 
on a daily basis.  
• Consistent use of summative and formative data to inform instruction Examples: entrance and exit cards, pre-assessment, 
unit assessment, writing, conference notes, use of self, peer & teacher rubrics.  
• Use of pre and post tests to determine mastery.  
• Re-teach clinics and expert fairs 
 • Student Assessment Notebook (SAN) are a living, breathing document that captures the individual process of learning. 
Students reflect on their progress toward mastery of the learning targets which is tied directly to their content curriculum 
maps.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
ENL teachers provide support and are available to staff, students and parents to assist ELLs as they transition from elementary 
to 
middle school. ENL teachers, administrators and secretaries consult with parents, teachers and students on issues related to 
transitioning to middle school.  The guidance counselor, social worker and psychologist support the social aspects of coming 
into a 
new country or new school. ENL teachers and the parent coordinator also provide information to parents, teachers and other 
school 
staff about ENL programs in middle schools, exam information, the general transition period and creating support networks in 
their  
new school. ENL teachers and the Parent Coordinator reach out to parents about any issues/questions they may have 
regarding  
their child’s future.  Moreover, we send translated middle school fliers; middle school application information  in the  
parents' native language.    
Several professional development sessions (7.5 mandated hours for general education staff as well 10 hours for special 
education       
staff) are scheduled with the entire school staff which includes Parent coordinator, Secretaries, Para-  Professionals, related 
service   
providers, social worker and school psychologist, general education and special education teachers.  under the direction of the 
ELL   
instructor and professional development team.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
ENL teachers will provide annual individual meetings with parent of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs  in all content areas on 
Tuesday afternoons during out parent outreach allocated time.  We utilize in house staff to speak to parents in their native 
language or outside interpreters.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

The needs of our parents are evaluated on a monthly basis through the use of an internal survey. Parent involvement is 
embedded in our school practices which include: SLC's: Student Led Conferences are a unique practice at MAELS in that they 
replace the traditional parent-teacher conference.  Implementing Student Led conferences has been a positive learning 
process and culture shift for our students, teacher and parents. We believe that the traditional Parent Teacher Conference 
places the focus of the conversation on the strengths and improvement areas of the student in a conversation limited to the 
parent and teacher whereas the Student Led Conference empowers the student to be accountable for their own learning and 
articulate their individual process of learning. Students identify learning targets in each of their content areas, explains how 
they mastered that learning target by describing specific strategies used in the classroom, then each student shares the final 
product for that learning target along with the assessment(s) that went along with the entire process. We have translation 
services available at these events.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Cara De Angelo, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

(*Primary) 

 

   

 
* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We gather data from the classroom teachers and the Home Language Identification Survey to determine the need 
for translation of materials or interpretation. All written communications between the school and students’ 
homes are provided in both languages as a matter of school protocol. All school functions, such as Open School 
Night, graduation, and other celebrations are conducted with translators..  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54

Language  

Our school has found that 
many of our translation and 
interpretation needs are for 
communication between 
the teachers and the 
parents.  

Where most of the DOE 
forms are available in every 
language, teacher notes 
and conversation are not as 
easily or quickly translated 
or  

interpreted.We fulfill all our 
school’s written translation 
and oral interpretation 
needs using the resources 
present in our staff or by 
utilizing the DOEs 
translation unit. Bilingual 
staff members facilitate 
meetings between parents 
and teachers in order to 
ensure that all translation 
needs are met. Bilingual 
members of staff also 
support english-dominant 
staff members in 
translating notices and 
letters to parents to ensure 
all materials are provided in 
students' language of 
preference. Based on the 
minutes of Parent 
Association meetings and 
communication with Parent 
Coordinator, our parent 
community is very satisfied 
with our method of home-
school communications 
These findings come from 
ats as well as surveying 
teachers and parents  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.

Include procedures to ensure timely 
provision of translated documents 

 

to parents.  

Every year the following documents 
will be translated two weeks prior to 
the actual date:  

 

parent teacher confernces, after 
school program, meet the teacher 
night, notification of upcoming 
assessments  

   

 

2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as 

parent-teacher  
conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.  
   

Meeting Name  

Month/Frequency of Meetings  

How does your school plan to 

provide interpretation service(s)?  

 

 

In order to meet the needs of oral 
interpretation, we have looked to the 
Translation and Interpretation Unit of 
the NYC DOE. We also draw upon the 
resources which are currently 
available in our school. These 
resources include teachers and other 
staff members who are fluent in the 
language needed to be interpreted  

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Our school will hold a parent workshop to advise parents of the language assistance we provide.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school will issue a parent survey in order to gather feedback from them on the quality and availability of 
translation services. Information gathered from this survey will inform improvements if necessary.
