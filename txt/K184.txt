Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
At PS 184 rigor is creating an environment where high expectations for all students are prioritized and we provide the 
students with the skills and motivation needed to support them in developing the qualities and skills necessary to 
enroll, persist, and succeed in college and careers. 

In our building, rigor is continuous and ongoing in teacher development focusing on supporting all students to meet 
the Common Core standards. The principal and two assistant principals conduct short frequent observations as well as 
informal and formal observations and provide teachers with formative feedback and professional development to 
support improved practice. We have selected specific competencies relevant to teachers’ developmental needs and 
that most support implementation of the Common Core standards - Charlotte Danielson’s Framework for Teaching. 

 

Our school provides a broad and compelling curriculum that enhances student learning across the subjects. The 
school is creatively utilizing innovative curriculum programs that align with its goals to challenge students to think 
more critically. To go above and beyond the regular core curricula, we utilize various computer programs to enhance 
reading and math and incorporate the arts project-based, theme-based and performance-oriented instruction. Our 
curriculum is aligned to the key State Standards. We have fully embraced the New York City 

curriculum in Grades K-8 ELA and Math. 

These are the programs we utilize: 

• Ready Gen (Grades K-5) - This common core aligned reading program is used in Grades K-5 and teachers are 
continuously adapting and refining their lessons using depth of knowledge to meet the needs of all the learners in 
their class. Grade teams collaborate to develop and design assignments, assessments, tasks, projects and anticipated 
outcomes that are aligned through the grade. Teachers are highly committed to working with students to identify 
individual goals for improvement, differentiate instruction, improve learning and align lesson planning to the Shifts in 
Literacy. Detailed curriculum maps and calendars are created to provide teachers with the objectives, skills, and 
differentiation ideas. 

• Code X (Grades 6-8) – This common core aligned reading program is used in Grades 6-8 and teachers are 
continuously adapting and refining their lessons using depth of knowledge to meet the needs of all the learners in 
their class. Teachers integrate authentic, complex grade-level nonfiction and literary text types, whole- and small-
group teaching, classroom routines for developing academic discourse, instruction to meet students at different 
levels, and rigorous writing tasks and projects. Detailed curriculum maps and calendars are created to provide 
teachers with the objectives, skills, and differentiation ideas. 

• MyOn Reader - This program is a reader which is a complete literacy program providing access to thousands of 
enhanced digital books, recommending content by interest and reading level. This is used in Grades 2-8 in conjunction 
with guided/independent reading.  

• Go Math (Grades K-5) - This common core aligned math program is being used in Grades K-5 and teachers are 
continuously adapting and refining their lessons ensuring they are aligned to the Shifts in Math. Detailed curriculum 
maps and calendars are created to provide teachers with the objectives, skills, and differentiation ideas. The pacing of 
the program allows for more depth, so the teachers have more time to teach for understanding. Go Math develops 
conceptual understanding through daily problem-solving and step-by step Visual Learning and it offers the right 
amount of support and challenge for every student. 

• CMP3 (Grades 6-8) - This common core aligned math program is being used in Grades 6-8 and teachers are 
continuously adapting and refining their lessons ensuring they are aligned to the Shifts in Math. The teachers are 
working to help the students’ reason and communicate proficiently in mathematics. Teachers encourage the use of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

vocabulary, forms of representation, materials, tools, techniques, and intellectual methods of math to solve problems 
with reason, insight, inventiveness, and technical proficiency. Detailed curriculum maps and calendars are created to 
provide teachers with the objectives, skills, and differentiation ideas.  

We were a Learning Partner School (LPP) for 3 consecutive school years and will continue to implement the strategies 
and structures obtained as a result of this partnership. Via the LPP Continuation grant we will continue to enhance 
teaching practices to ensure students continuously make progress, Through LPP, we had the opportunity to visit our 
host school to observe and implement some of their strong practices in reading development. Our focus via LPP was 
on student engagement in reading. Through these collaborative visits, the teachers have adopted some of the 
observed practices and have shared them with their colleagues through inter-visitations. We have worked very closely 
with our host school to understand the systems and structures developed in their school to improve outcomes for our 
students. Additionally, to support our Middle School students we also engaged in another DOE initiative- 
MSQI(Middle School Quality Initiative). Via this initiative we have developed several whole school non-negotiables as 
it relates to providing meaningful literacy instruction, for example; small group instruction, independent reading, daily 
discussion or spoken language activities, book talks, book of the month and core texts for each grade level.. 

As an administrative cabinet we take weekly instructional walks to look for evidence of our instructional focus across 
grade bands in the building. As a result, we provided our teachers with explicit professional development in the 
execution of ReadyGen, GO Math, CMP3 and CodeX Lessons. To ensure that teachers were provided with the 
professional development needed to enhance their practices differentiated professional development opportunities 
are provided. We continue to monitor the implementation of our chosen Curriculums through informal walkthroughs 
and observations, providing teachers with feedback both informally and formally. To further enhance our 
instructional coherence in all classes, all teachers adhere to a structured prototype for the delivery of ELA and Math 
instruction. 

Our administrators and teachers are continuously taking a critical look at the current educational programs to help 
the school define implications for the changes that need to be considered. This leads to the development of 
educational priorities in support of the school’s vision. Once priorities are established, they are further defined by the 
development of specific annual goals and measurable objectives, and action plans that will translate into observable, 
effective strategies to improve student achievement. Carrying out these assessments, analyses, and planning tasks, 
and the activities decided upon, becomes the work of improving the school. Budgetary resources and other 
organizational decisions are then aligned to the schools long term goals. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Student with disabilities, English Language Learners, Students in Temporary Housing. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our major focus for this year is that all staff and students at P.S. 184 will engage in a coordinated whole-school effort 
to have all students show growth in reading comprehension and the ability to demonstrate knowledge through 
effective, critical questioning and text-based discussions across the curricula through the implementation of a set of

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
As per the most recent School Quality review, " school leaders and faculty ensure that curricula are aligned to CCLS 
and the instructional shifts. Across grades and subjects, rigorous habits and higher order skills are emphasized for all 
students, including ELLs and SWDs. Recent performance data has indicated that our Students with Special Needs and 
our English Languages Learners are demonstrating or improving towards proficiency at the same rate as those of our 
General Education Students, however, getting students to perform at a level 3 remains a challenge. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019 SWD and ELLs will demonstrate a 10% improvement in performance(proficiency level) as evidenced by 
their performance on the NYS ELA State Exam..

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
As an administrative cabinet we conduct weekly instructional walks to look for evidence of our instructional focus 
across grade bands in the building. As a result, we provided our teachers with explicit professional development in the 
execution of ReadyGen, GO Math, CMP3 and CodeX Lessons. We continue to monitor the implementation of our 
chosen Curriculums through informal walkthroughs and observations, providing teachers with feedback both 
informally and formally. To further enhance our instructional coherence in all of the classes, all elementary classes 
have ReadyGen and GO Math Concept boards visible so both students and visitors can reference them for the 
essential understanding for the current unit. In addition to daily Common Core aligned instruction we have partnered 
with Green Generations which will support students social emotional growth. Green Generations will be housed at 
184 2 times per week and will empower students with life skills, healthy self esteems and emotional nurturance. 
Additionally, via another DOE initiative- Single Shepherds we have been assigned a Guidance Counselor and Social 
Worker who are specifically assigned to our middle school students.To promote a strong school community, every 
morning all cohorts Pk-2, 3-5, 6-8 engage in morning circle whereby our school motto and core values are chorally 
recited. Via our middle school extended day program our CBO has increased the extra curricular offerings as we have 
begun a marching band. Lastly, our middle school students will participate in Broadway Jr. and the MSQI Debate 
league to further enhance and expose them to additional opportunities and venues to express themselves orally. 

 

As per our most recent School Quality Review- "The school’s professional development plan reveals that all teachers 
receive ongoing training in both planning and delivering rigorous instruction and implementing social\emotional 
learning initiatives. Along with training in topics such as effective questioning and using assessment in instruction, 
teachers receive training to implement a Positive Behavior Intervention Support program designed to improve 
students’ social emotional learning skills across grades. Through grade team meetings, staff conferences, study groups 
and inter-visitations, including visits to a host school as part of the Learning Partners’ Program, teachers are 
supported by peers, including model teachers, coaches and administrators, in planning lessons that align to school 
wide instructional expectations". 

 

To continuously enhance and maintain a a school culture where students feel safe, supported and challenged by their 
teachers we have implemented "Morning Circle". During our school wide morning circles our school motto along with 
our core values of being respectful, responsible and ready to learn are recited to as a reminder of expectations 
throughout the day. During morning circle students are recognized for good citizenship and compliance with our core 
values.

The 2017 Framework for Great Schools Report indicates that 52% of our students have a 90% or higher attendance 
rate, compared with the city average of 80%. This indicates a need to improve attendance for at least half of the 
school's population.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, there will be a 5% decrease in PPT referrals for General Education students and a 5% decrease in 
suspensions of SWD's.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As a result of our 3 year involvement in the Learning Partners Program we have had the opportunity to visit our host 
school to observe and begin to implement some of their strong practices in reading development which allowed us to 
strengthen our instructional coherence across grades. With a focus on student engagement in reading and through 
the collaborative visits, the teachers have adopted some of the observed practices and have shared them with their 
colleagues through inter-visitations. We worked very closely with our host school to understand the systems and 
structures developed in their school to improve outcomes for our students. We will continue to develop a program 
that allows for weekly common planning as it was a common practice during the 2017-2018 school year. In the 
upcoming school year an increase in vertical teacher team meetings will be programmed.  

 

Advance data also indicates that Domain 3 (Instruction) is an area in which teacher performance has room to grow. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By February 2019 we will meet or exceed the district and citywide benchmarks as it relates to observation completion 
in the Advance system.

Initial teacher professional learning self assessment surveys will 
be administered to gauge an assessment of individual teacher 
needs. Based on the results, professional learning sessions will 
be tailored to accommodate differentiated teacher learning. A 
wide array of professional learning resources will be utilized, 
such as videos from Office of Teacher Effectiveness,DOE’s 
Teacher Page, MSQI Coach, Peer Collaborative and Model 
teachers 

Carefully analyze and review Advance data to group teacher 
needs as per the component that yields ineffective or developing 
ratings. Specifically address previous year's MOTP ratings during 
Initial Planning Conferences.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As per the most recent School Quality Review report," teacher teams consistently analyze data and student work for 
students that they share. Distributed leadership structures are in place. Across the school, teachers have built 
leadership capacity and have a vocie in key decisions that affect student learning. We did not meet this goal(7% 
increase..) for the 2017-2018 school year, however, increasing teacher influence throughout the building remains a 
priority, therefore, we have decided to carry this goal over to the following school year with enhancements to the 
action plan. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the school administration will include a bi-weekly attachment to weekly updates, highlighting best 
practices identified in the building, sharing instructional and other pedagogical resources focused on planning and 
targeted delivery of instruction for all content areas with a specific focus on ELLs and SWDs, in order to support and 
increase the capacity of all staff, resulting in a 7% increase in positive responses to Teacher Influenced questions on the 
NYC School Survey.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Teaching assignments are designed with the intent to bridge the achievement gap thereby increasing student 
achievement and learning. Model Teachers and Lead teachers are provided with professional learning opportunities 
to ensure that their pedagogical practices reflect recent trends and proven practices. This information is then 
differentiated and disseminated to the staff during Professional Development (PD) Monday or “Lunch & Learn” for 
varying levels of teacher experience. In addition to this differentiated PD, all first year teachers have mentors that 
serve as guides that help them to be successful from the start.  

Additionally, Model Teachers will assist with inter-visitations both within the school and to partner schools within the 
district to identify best practices and help develop teacher pedagogy in the building. Teachers participating in the 
inter-visitations and outside professional development will professional learning sessions catered to the needs of their 
grade colleagues. Strategies for retention are inclusive of building capacity within. Teacher leaders lead professional 
development sessions and are also provided with actionable feedback to continuously master the craft of leading 
adult professional development. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Professional development combined with collaboration is at the core of increasing our students’ capacity. Teacher 
teams are afforded numerous opportunities to meet ranging from Professional Development Mondays, weekly 
teacher team meetings, Lunch and Learns, per session activities, bi-monthly leadership team meetings , on-site 
consultant training, and off-site staff training. These meetings are structured so that teachers’ professional 
responsibilities are aligned with the school’s instructional goals, thereby focusing teacher time on instructional work 
and data analysis and resulting in improved instruction that engages all students in rigorous academic tasks.

As a Community Learning School via the support of the UFT in collaboration with AFT and First Books, PS\IS 184 has 
the opportunity to participate in a the pilot program T2K. T2K(Transitioning to Kindergarten) was piloted in our school 
during the 2014-2015 school year with a heavy emphasis on fostering literacy and numeracy skills, as well as, socio-
emotional development. During the celebration of the pilot all students were provided with 2 books and families were 
also provided with activities to support their children at home. The collaborarion and support has transitioned in to 
the new school year as Pre-K educators and kindergarten educators will engage in a collaborative 
discussion\workshop to continue the work and assess the effectiveness of T2K which will be led by the Elementary 
School Division of the UFT. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
 

Staff members are programmed for weekly common planning sessions and are members of Professional Learning 
Communities where they share best practices for improving student learning through improved instruction. 
Teamwork during common planning periods is structured via cycles of inquiry based activities that reflect a specific 
weekly area of focus. Team members “cycle” through monthly activities labeled as, “Week 1 - Data, Week 2 - 
Danielson Framework, Week 3 - Looking at Student Work and Week 4 - Curriculum”. All teachers will engage in weekly 
data meetings as they identify student gaps via informal and formal assessments. Teachers have been provided with a 
protocol to effectively analyze student data to inform their instructional practice. Our school also has a MOSL team in 
place that works collaboratively with the administration to select appropriate assessment measures. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met.

2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Newport School-PS\IS 184 in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The Newport School -PS\IS 184 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, NYC School Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
To assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs, the Fountas & Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System 1 is administered during a 
one-on-one, student-teacher conference. The student reads aloud and talks about a series of benchmark books while the 
teacher observes and note student behaviors on constructed recording forms. Utilizing the procedures for analysis establishes 
optimal learning levels and valuable information about each individuals processing strategies, fluency, and comprehension. 
After reviewing data from the 
F&P, the Ells continue to struggle with comprehension but can decode with some fluency. Moreover, all of which give insights 
about how to target a teacher's teaching and about ELLs.The data allows for ELLs to be targeted for Academic Intervention 
Services(AIS). 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Fountas & Pinnell provides information such as, data to recommend placement level for instruction, form groups for reading 
instruction, select texts that will be productive for a student's instruction and identify children who need intervention and 
extra help. These benchmarks are grounded in research and reflect the current Standards. Data is shared with the ENL teacher 
and provides information to further develop an ELLs’ progress and instructional development. ELLs are actively engaged in 
standards-based academic curriculum. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 
ELL Periodic Baseline Assessment is designed to provide teachers with detailed information about their students' strengths and 
needs in English language development and to serve as a resource to help plan individual and group instruction. The 
assessment is aligned to the same standards as the NYSESLAT. The ELLs are assessed in Listening, Writing, Reading and 
Speaking twice a year with NYC ELL Periodic Assessment and Schoolnet Baseline/Benchmark assessments in ELA and Math. 
Performance Series also provides teachers with test results, personalized to each student including ELLs that establish 
correct overall placement in core curriculum areas (Reading and Math). These tests provide a longitudinal view of student 
growth. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The data shows where students need reinforcements as well as areas where instruction can be advanced to the next levels. 
Once the summative data has been gathered the School leadership and teachers use data to differentiate instruction to meet 
the needs of all students. The instruction is based upon language proficiency and grade level. The teachers implement 
interventions and change strategies during instruction to support student learning goals. The school leadership, LAP team 
members, and teachers, use the results of periodic assessments to determine the appropriate materials, criteria for grouping 
,interventions for students in both reading, mathematics, and other content area learning. Specific conversations take place 
revolving individual ELL students and their academic goals. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
In order to meet ELLs’ needs in an RTI framework, it is important to understand their characteristics as children and learners, 
and to ensure that we view their status as language learners as an asset to draw upon as well as a dynamic developmental 
process that is inextricably tied to learning opportunities. Being aware of some of the common misconceptions about the 
language learning process for ELL students. In addition to having an understanding of these misconceptions, it is essential for 
practitioners to investigate their students’ educational and linguistic histories. Teachers need to build upon the linguistic 
capabilities students bring to the classroom and understand where challenges may lie. With an understanding of this child’s 
linguistic strengths, the teacher could guide the child to use cognates or familiar concepts in Spanish to support her English 
reading comprehension. Progress monitoring data is used to make educational decisions about changes in goals, instruction, 
and/or services; as well as whether to consider a referral for special education services. When progress is monitored, the 
expected rate of an ELL’s progress takes into account language development 
and background. The student’s progress is then compared with levels demonstrated by peers from comparable cultural, 
linguistic, and experiential backgrounds who have received the same or comparable intervention. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
In order to evaluate the success of our program for ELLs our school needs to maintain the LAP as a systematic plan for 
language development that guides our students until they acquire academic proficiency in English. LAP principles are designed 
to create a plan to address the needs of our ELL population. The LAP is reviewed annually to determine its effectiveness. Our 
ENL program goals are to provide academic content-area instruction in English. Utilizing ESL methodology, instructional 
strategies, and native language support to make content comprehensible. As evidenced by the progress our students are 
making on the NYSESLAT and state assessments our ELL program is currently meeting the needs of our students. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The program uses content-based instruction and follows the ENL state standards to achieve English proficiency. The NYSESLAT 
will measure the English Language Arts proficiency of ELLs from year to year each spring. School leadership and teachers use 
data from NYSESLAT, Periodic Assessments and student work to differentiate instruction to meet the needs of all students. The 
instruction is based upon language proficiency and grade level. The teachers make adjustments to implement interventions 
and change strategies during instruction to support student learning goals. The students display a greater need to develop 
reading comprehension and writing skills based on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores across all grade levels. The results of the 
ELL Periodic Assessments are shared with classroom teachers as well as the students in grades 3-8 through individual/small 
group conferences with the ENL teacher. The school leadership, LAP team members, and teachers, use the results of periodic 
assessments to determine the appropriate materials, criteria for grouping ,interventions for students in both reading, 
mathematics, and other content area learning. Specific conversations take place revolving individual ELL students and their 
academic goals. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Specific scheduling will be based on the 2017 NYSESLAT. In general, all ELLs are included in classes with native English 
speackers and are heterogeneously grouped. Students that are Entering, Emerging or Transitioning are pulled out for 
stand-alone ENL instruction by a certified ENL teacher. The remaining integrated ENL units of instruction are provided 
by the certified ENL teacher in a push-in model. Students at the Expanding or Commanding levels are provided with 
push-in ENL services integrated with ELA or 
other content area by a certified ENL teacher. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The Certified ENL teacher creates a program that specifies the periods when ELLs are pulled out for stand alone ENL instruction 
and periods when ELLs receive push-in for integrated ENL instruction, along with student lists indicating ENL instruction time. 
Programming ENL in STARS classroom for grades K-8 with the Assistant Principal and ENL teacher together allows the school to 
ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided. 
The English Language Learner Data Update Report (EDUR) provides data to make sure the school is making important decisions 
regarding ELL programming and services. It is a great resource that provides important data. Entering and Emerging  level 
students will receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week. Emerging students have the flexibility of .5 unit of study can be 
Stand-Alone ENL or integrated ENL/Core content area. Transitioning and Expanding level students will receive 180 minutes of 
ENL/ELA or other content area instruction per week. Commanding students will receive 90 minute of Integrated ENL in 
ELA/Core content area for two years. Students are grouped on proficiency level. Proficiency level materials are being utilized 
by the ENL teacher. In all classrooms teachers use ESL strategies to teach content areas. ELLs are also supported through using 
dictionaries and ELLs are allowed to talk to their peers in their native language.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In order to maximize English language acquisition for ELLs, the ENL and classroom teacher work closely to deliver literacy 
instruction using materials from the core curricula, as well as tailor additional content instruction to meet the needs of our 
ELLs. To maximize language development, the teachers will spend time planning together. This enables the ENL teacher to 
meet the needs of her ELL students in a differentiated manner using ESL strategies. This makes the content much more 
comprehensible for those students. Additional resources such as RIGOR are utilized with older newcomers to teach basic 
literacy skills through the content areas. All instruction is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

To ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language, PS 184 does two things. The ENL teacher will ensure 
they are appropriately evaluated in their native language using the Spanish (LAB) to determine language dominance to those 
that qualify for Spanish testing when taking the NYSITELL. Another procedure we have in place involves the assistance of our 
assistant principal/ testing coordinator. The Assistant Principal/testing coordinator articulates with classroom and the ENL 
teacher to provide the state assessments in Math and Science in native languages for students who would benefit from 
translated tests. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. SIFE students will be screened for enrollment with the HLIS to determine NYSITELL eligibility. If the home language is other 
than English or if the student’s native language is other than English, the ENL teacher will administer the NYSITELL.  If 
necessary, an informal student/parent interview will be conducted to discuss the proper program placement into the school’s 
program. Moreover, the ENL teacher has attended a Technical Assistance session on the identification of Students with 
Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) using a SIFE questionnaire. SIFE students would receive academic intervention in the form 
of small group instruction. 
b. The ELLs who require 360 minutes are seen for 8 periods of ENL instruction per week. These students display a greater need 
in every area. Therefore, they receive both push-in Integrated and pull-out Stand Alone methods. The targeted areas of 
instruction will focus on using best practices such as front-loading vocabulary, using pictures and sentence frames. Native 
language support is provided through the use of Bilingual dictionaries, native language classroom libraries and the buddy 
system. 
c. For our developing ELLs they continue to receive mandated services as well any necessary accommodations. Students are 
provided content area support through the use of the Visions program which offers authentic literature with a balance of 
fiction and non fiction, biographies, informational and content-based readings. 
d. Long-term ELLs may benefit from RIGOR Reading Instructional Goals for Older Readers. RIGOR will help teachers to build the 
foundational skills these students lack. RIGOR will provide intensive vocabulary instruction and practice of everyday (Tier One) 
words, complex (Tier Two) words, and content-area (Tier Three) words. 
e. ENL support services are extended for up to two years after the student has achieved a Commanding (Proficient level) of 
English on the NYSESLAT. Commanding levels are provided with push-in services .5 unit of study integrated ENL with ELA or 
other content area by a certified ENL teacher. Moreover, the school will provide testing accommodations on New York State 
Examinations to ELLs for up to two years after they achieve Commanding Proficiency on the NYSESLAT. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
To foster academic gains for our ELL-SWDs we provide professional development to our special education teachers to improve 
strategies they use in order to meet the needs of their students. They attend workshops given by the Department of English 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

Language Learners. These workshops help the teachers provide the academic content that is necessary but with a 
differentiated approach so that the needs of their learners are met. They provide such strategies as front loading vocabulary, 
using sentence frames to accelerate language development, close reading and picture support. Such techniques help to add to 
the children's vocabulary development and the understanding of new words and content in all subject areas. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The ENL teacher attends Individualized Education Plan (IEP) meetings to address the needs of ELLs identified as having special 
special needs. There is communication between the SETTS teacher, classroom teacher, SBST and the ENL teacher to plan for 
ELLs identified as having special needs.The ENL teacher , classroom teacher, and IEP teacher ensure that ELL-SWDs whose IEP 
mandates ENL instruction receive the appropriate program through conferencing and planning their schedule based on their 
mandated services on their IEPs. Flexible programming is used to maximize time spent with non-disabled peers based on their 
NYSESLAT and grade levels. ELLs with IEPs are grouped with ELLs in general education to receive ENL services. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted interventions in ELA and Math include small group instruction,  one-to-one tutoring and conferencing in 
English. These interventions are provided in all of our grades, K-8 by the classroom teachers as well as the ENL teacher. 
Fundations and Reading Reform and iRead Intervention is also provided in grades K,  1 and 2. Imagine Learning is implemented 
in the ENL classroom. Imagine Learning is a language and literacy software program for ELLs, struggling readers, and ELL-
SWDs. Imagine Learning offers strategic first-language support in which key words are clarified and defined in the student's 
first language. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Benchmark Education Company's RIGOR skill Bags are a unique, comprehensive set of intervention resources we will use to 
accelerate the literacy and language development of our ELLs. RIGOR is an appropriate new intervention for all students in 
Grades 3-8. ELLs may benefit from RIGOR Reading Instructional Goals for Older Readers. RIGOR will help teachers to build the 
foundational skills these students lack. RIGOR will provide intensive vocabulary instruction and practice of everyday (Tier One) 
words, complex (Tier Two) words, and content-area (Tier Three) words. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELL students have equal access to any and all programs offered at the school. They are invited to participate in the after school 
program, are considered for at-risk services. The after school program provides homework help, literacy and math support, 
physical and other recreational activities.  ELLs participate in the full curriculum offered at PS/IS 184, including Literacy, Math, 
Social Studies, Science, Technology, Art and Physical Education. Math and Science curriculum will supplement in class material 
and is taught using the literacy connections and manipulative. Literature and writing skills are taught using literacy prototype 
and ESL methodologies including hands-on activities to encourage higher order thinking and reading comprehension. ELLs 
engage in small group instruction with their ENL service providers in order to have full access to the curriculum.  Grades K-1 
are implementing Reading Reform and Fundations for Grade 2 which include our ELLs. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Technology is used to support ELLs through the use of lap tops or ipads in the classroom. These ipads give students the 
opportunity to improve their literacy skills with the use of interactive apps. In addition to ipads, computers  Smart Boards are 
available in some of our classrooms to enhance the teaching and learning for all students, including our ELL population. We 
have also incorporated the MYON program in  our classes which allows children to read independently on an 
ipad/laptop.  These materials will be incorporated into the ESL program to support language acquisition. through the use of

translated texts, MYON reader in Spanish and English.  In this literacy/technology program, children have their reading 
monitored through comprehension questions that are both multiple choice and short response. ELL's and ELL-SWDs are 
supported with the same core Curriculum materials as the rest of the student population. This includes Glencoe Science, 
Houghton-Mifflen Social studies, informative test reading material. The content area and ELA/Math materials are available and 
used as on-line resources as well.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Both elementary and middle school level ENL classroom offers language support in the native language. Using native language 
support makes content comprehensible. The native language (Spanish, Haitian -Creole, and Arabic) and English validates the 
prior knowledge students bring, and bolsters self-esteem. In the ENL classroom native language support is offered through the 
use of bilingual dictionaries, native language classroom libraries and the buddy system. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required services/resources support correspond to the age and grade levels of ELLs. Teachers use the Common Core Standards 
and ENL Standards to drive their instruction. 
Challenging material is introduced to Expanding (Advanced) level students to stimulate increased academic language skills. 
ELLs participate in the full curriculum offered at PS/IS 184, including Literacy, Math, Social Studies, Science, Technology, Art 
and Physical Education. 
Implementing RIGOR places particular emphasis on the needs of older ELLs who are still preliterate or reading at the Grade 3 
level or below. There are many categories of students who may benefit from this intervention. For ELLs who have reached 
(Proficiency)Commanding on the NYSESLAT, the school will provide .5 unit of study per week of Integrated ENL in ELA/Core 
Content. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
To assist newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year letters are sent in January, to provide 
information about important dates and activities that may take place. We will meet in June with the newly enrolled ELLs. We 
will provide them with support to work on during the summer months to better prepare themselves for the incoming school 
year. They will also be provided with information on programs that will be available throughout the summer through the New 
York City Department of Education for ELLs. Parents are invited to attend a parent orientation to meet their child's teacher. At 
this meeting, teachers give clear expectations and parents have the opportunity to ask questions. Translation services are 
made available upon request. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish classes are offered to our Pre-K, K, 1st grade and 6th grade in the middle school and includes all ELLs. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Teachers of ELLs, including the general education teachers, subject area teachers, ENL and special education teachers share 
common planning periods to facilitate professional development. The planning periods allow time for the development of 
mini-lessons and an opportunity to look at student work so that decisions can be made on which instructional strategies would 
work best. During the common planning periods, our ENL Coordinator supports teachers of ELLs by providing strategies that 
will also support their instruction. In addition to the professional development opportunities offered at our school, our ENL 
teachers participate in professional 
development offered by the Department of ELLs. Workshop notes are shared amongst the staff and at times the ENL teacher is 
given the opportunity to turn key what was learned at professional development meetings. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our school's 2017-18 Professional Development Plan for the year includes best practices in rigorous ELL instruction. 
All teachers, including ENL teacher, will participate in this professional development. In addition the ENL teacher 
attends ELL-specific professional development provided by the Regional Bilingual Special Education Specialists and the 
Department of Education. The ENL teacher attends PD in regards to meeting the needs of ELLs with special needs. The series of 
workshops are provided by the Regional Bilingual Special Education Specialists of RSE-TASC. Moreover, the ENL teacher 
attends an ELL Coordinators Working Group provided by the Brooklyn North Field Support Center. These meetings are ELL 
specific in regards to ELL Checklist for school leaders and ELL Coordinators, Identification, Programming, NYSITELL, 
NYSESLAT and Best Practices (small groups). The workshops offer professional development support and allows the ENL 
teacher to turnkey information for staff who is in need of ELL-specific professional development. Teachers should keep 
documentation of all training received and are responsible for maintaining their own records. In addition, if teachers have 
completed a 3 credit college course in ESL/ENL methodology that meets the of ELL-specific training for professional 
development. The ENL teacher keeps records of these professional development activities in the form of agendas and a list of 
attendance and location. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parent engagement time will be used by the ENL teacher to schedule weekly meetings for specific parents. A 
schedule/calendar for these meetings will be established and translators will be provided by in house translators, or phone 
translation by the language and interpretation unit 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

In order to foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs, The Newport School holds several parent engagement evenings. 
We also host a Family Game Night where parents and children are invited to play games such as bingo, chess, and checkers 
with their children. It is the intent of activities such as these to support the home-school connection for all of our parents, 
including the parents of ELLs.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our Parent Coordinator is in regular contact with parents, ensuring that parents are receiving the translation services 
that they need. Feedback from parents is also gathered through PA meetings, School Leadership Team meetings, and 
through the annual school environment survey. The primary language of each parent is maintained in ATS and on the 
student emergency card. This resource is available when parents complete the Home Language Identification Survey 
and the Emergency Contact card. Parents who request interpretation services regarding critical information about 
their child's education will be provided in house by school staff and, when necessary, using the Translation and 
Interpretation Unit using Speakerphone. Parents are encouraged to contact the school's parent coordinator for 
language assistance.
