Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

A review of the February 2019 mid year IReady ELA assessment reflects the following data:  

In grade K, students scored 21% on the mid year IReady exam, reflecting an increase from 7% on beginning of year 
IReady exam. 

In grade 1, students scored 18% on the mid year IReady exam, reflecting an increase from 9% on beginning of year 
IReady exam. 

In grade 2, students scored 26% on the mid year IReady exam, reflecting an increase from 15% on beginning of year 
IReady exam. 

In grade 3, students scored 33% on the mid year IReady exam, reflecting an increase from 7% on beginning of year 
IReady exam. 

In grade 4, students scored 13% on the mid year IReady exam, reflecting an increase from 7% on beginning of year 
IReady exam. 

In grade 5, students scored 14% on the mid year IReady exam, reflecting an increase from 5% on beginning of year 
IReady exam. 

In grade 6, students scored 13% on the mid year IReady exam, reflecting an increase from 9% on beginning of year 
IReady exam. 

In grade 7, students scored 5% on the mid year IReady exam, reflecting an increase from 0% on beginning of year 
IReady exam. 

In grade 8, students scored 0% on the mid year IReady exam, but there was no original data entered for the beginning 
of year IReady exam. Therefore there is no base data for comparison,  

The overall average percentage of students in grades K-8 who achieved Tier 1, on grade level, as measured by the ELA 
mid year IReady exam, was 15.8%. 

The overall average percentage of students in grades 3-8 who achieved Tier 1, on grade level, as measured by the ELA 
mid year IReady exam, was 11.3%. 

We have not met our February progress monitoring goal of at least 30% of students in grades 3-8 who will achieve at 
least a level 3 or 4 literacy proficiency.  

Our next CEP action steps will include the following: 

Schedule all middle school students in grades 3-8 at least 2-3 times per week for IReady literacy instruction. 

Supervisors will monitor and collect for analysis the students' IReady time on task and literacy progress.  

Supervisors and teachers will consult every two weeks to track the students' literacy progress in ELA IReady.

2018, Quality Review Indicator 4.2 was rated proficient, as an area of celebration. 

According to the PPO conducted by the Principal Leadership Facilitator, on March 28, 2018, QR 4.2 was cited with the 
following recommendation: "The faculty continues to engage in team meetings across the grades, but the focus of 
these sessions remains with a need to be grounded in data or student work...Although most teachers meet in 
professional collaborations on teams, these are loosely connected to school wide goals and the use of the inquiry

approach is developing across teams. There is a lack of documentation of these meetings, such that protocols, student 
work, data analysis, and next steps are left to individual's memory."  

According to the PPO conducted by the Principal Leadership Facilitator, on March 28, 2018, QR 4.2 was cited with the 
following next steps: "Support staff in selecting and implementing a couple of data analysis protocols for assessments 
and student work reviews to ensure that teams maintain dialog to inform instruction and pedagogy, to provide 
students with the scaffolds, multiple entry points to access the curricula, and opportunities for student discussion. 
Continue to support teachers in consistently analyzing student work and data, so teachers track students' responses 
and determine next instructional steps to support improved teacher practice and progress toward goals for groups of 
students. Additionally, support teachers in determining a method and transparent platform for memorialization of 
their team meetings notes, agendas, data and student work analysis, and next steps to adjust and refine curricula and 
pedagogy for future use and to inform student achievement. This memorialization will demonstrate the full cycle of 
teaching including the re-plan, re-teach, and re-assess components."  

The school has developed its problem of practice for 2018-2019, as follows: " Based on the 2017-2018 Advance data, 
review of lesson plans, and post-observation meetings, teachers have acclimated students to low level thinking and 
work, as defined by Bloom's Taxonomy and Webb's Depth of Knowledge. As a result of low level instructional 
practices, students' academic performance levels are not reaching our school wide expectations or the expectations 
of the New York City Department of Education and New York State Education Department."

2018 to February 2019 since as a new administrative team we are ensuring that we are calibrated and rating with 
fidelity. Therefore, ensuring accuracy of ratings and providing developmental feedback to improve practice is at the 
core of our work . 

Our next CEP action steps will include the following: 

School leaders will continue to fully implement Advance system of evaluation and support and supplement the official 
Advance classroom visits, ratings, and feedback with informal and frequent classroom visits and feedback for all 
teachers. 

A calendar and debriefing form for such informal class visits will be developed to ensure effective implementation. 

Effective teachers will be recruited to “partner" with new teachers to provide support for meeting school 
expectations for classroom instruction, based on Danielson's Framework for Teaching and CCLS.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By February 2019, as a result of all school staff’s efforts to ensure meaningful family engagement, there will be at 
least a 7.5% increase in parents’ participation in school-wide events, activities, communication systems, and 
meetings, as measured by the Parent Coordinator Activity Report (PCAR) for the period of September 2018-February 
2019, compared to the Parent Coordinator Activity Report (PCAR) for September 2017-February 2018.  

A review of the Parent Coordinator Activity Report (PCAR) for the period of September 2018-end of January 2019, 
compared to the Parent Coordinator Activity Report (PCAR) for September 2017-the end of January 2018 reflects the 
following: 

During the period of September 2017-February 2018, there were 1,558 parents recorded as participating in school-
wide events, activities, communication systems, and meetings, as measured by the Parent Coordinator Activity 
Report (PCAR). 

During the period of September 2018-end of January 2019, there were 1,085 parents recorded as participating in 
school-wide events, activities, communication systems, and meetings, as measured by the Parent Coordinator Activity 
Report (PCAR). 

This data reflects a significant decrease (473 parents) in the number of parents recorded as participating in school-
wide events, activities, communication systems, and meetings. 

We did not meet our February 2019 progress monitoring goal of at least a 7.5% increase in parents’ participation in 
school-wide events, activities, communication systems, and meetings, as measured by the Parent Coordinator Activity 
Report (PCAR). 

Our next CEP action steps will include the following:  

Supervisors will closely monitor, on a weekly basis, the PCAR entries recording parents' participation in school-wide 
events, activities, and communication systems to ensure accurate recording. 

Supervisors will meet with the parent coordinator, on a weekly basis, to plan and reflect on the parent engagement 
activities that are implemented.  

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in our school. Therefore, James Weldon Johnson Leadership Academy PS/MS 57, in 
compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for 
creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student 
achievement between our school and the families. Our school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by 
actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children.Parents are 
encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee 
as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

James Weldon Johnson Leadership Academy PS/MS 57 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

 

 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 

 

fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress;

 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand; 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of our school community; 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

Parents/Families are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I 
Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of our school community.  

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, our school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the 
school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and

middle school located in East Harlem. The staff at P.S./M.S. 057M includes 2 certified ESL 
teachers and 4 certified bilingual teachers. The total student population is 784 students. Of the 
786 students at P.S./M.S.057M, 124 are English Language Learners (ELLs), including former 
ELLs. ELLs comprise 15.8% of the total student population. The home languages of the ELLs at 
P.S./M.S. 57 include Arabic, Bengali, Haitian-Creole, Portuguese and Spanish. 
After analyzing the 2018 NYSESLAT scores and the ELA results, the data shows that ELLs at 
P.S./M.S. 057M, including our long-term ELLs, need additional instruction in their reading and 
writing as well as continued work in speaking. The programs were carefully selected to target the 
needs of our ELLs to enhance on their English language skills. 
The anticipated dates of the program will be from November 10, 2018 through May 3, 2019, on 
Wednesdays and Thursdays for 1.5 hours from 2:30-4:00 PM. There will be 4 teachers 
implementing instruction for classes of heterogeneous level groupings of ELLs, who will work 
for 3 hours weekly for 15 weeks total amount being 30 sections. Two of the 4 teachers have an 
ENL license and the two others have a Bilingual Common Branch License. 
The target population of our Title III programming will be our population of long-term ELLs or 
students at risk of being long term ELL’s (12 incoming 6th, 7th and 8th graders for the 2018-
2019 school year), as well as the ELLs who received 1-2s on the ELA 2017- 2018 exam (almost 
100% of the school’s ELL population in 3r grade through 8th grade), including long term 
Ells  and students who did not score above the cut score in writing in the expanding level. 
The program will support student development in all of the four language modalities - reading, 
writing, listening and speaking. We will focus on all four modalities with an emphasis on the 
writing modality due to the 2017-2018 NYSESLAT scores.  Current Ells in the program  will 
engage in creating several newsletters with topics based on students’ interest according grade 
level and academic English proficiency based on 2017-2018 data. Teachers’ will build the 
students’ academic discourse and writing skills through drafting, revising, editing, and 
publishing.  Lower proficiency Ells will use their own illustrations to create picture stories and to 
use the illustration as a guide to write a story.  Culminating activity will be students presentation 
of a written story based on the original picture. The higher level proficiency Ells will interview 
other immigrants or themselves to document their experience in a new country.  Students will 
become familiar with the process of producing formal written documents, such as a newsletter. 
  In order to address these needs, the Title III after school program will implement the following: 
3rd through 5th grade students will participate in an interactive After school program with 
teacher created materials. The supported curricula will be aligned to the common core learning 
standards targeting the reading, writing, listening and speaking modalities. The after school 
program will mainly reinforce students reading and writing skills. Teachers will also build 
literacy skills using multiple strategies that best support ELLs by allowing them to practice their 
modalities through collaborative conversations while discussing high order thinking questions.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
The standard base instruction enables students to develop academic language through writing. 
Students will work on a writing piece based on the reading component presented. 
  
Middle school ELLs (6th through 8th grade) will publish a monthly school newspaper in print 
and digital form. Students will report on news across various themes, such as sports, current 
events, and the arts. Newspaper content will be informational, argumentative, and narrative. For 
example, in addition to traditional reporting, students might choose to write an editorial opinion 
piece or a sustained story with chapters published periodically. Students may choose 
photography or other visual representations, such as cartoons, to accompany their writing. An 
instructional focus will be building grade-level Tier II and Tier III vocabulary and practicing 
academic language structures in written form. As a conceptually consolidated school please note 
that other costs will be paid for please note that other costs will be paid for through additional 
school funding sources.

The professional development opportunities offered to the teachers involved in the Title III 
program include any workshops or training given by the Manhattan Field Support Center's ELL 
team and other opportunities that are presented to the PS 57 ELL team involving ENL 
instruction. Schedule: On-going, throughout the school year. 
 An ELL study group comprised of the four teachers in the Title III program will meet every 
Monday during the school’s allotted professional development time, from 3:00pm-3:40 p.m. The 
study group will focus on the following goals: 
  Integrating ENL strategies into the content areas (using the Meet the Masters curriculum). 
Topics to be covered are: 1. ENL strategies for reading, writing, listening, and speaking 2. 
Modifying lessons to incorporate ENL strategies 3. Content-specific ENL strategies 4. Content-
specific vocabulary for ELLs 5. Integrating Tier 2 vocabulary into the content area 6. Scaffolding 
activities for ELLs 7. Writing language objectives for ELLs in the content classroom 
 Increasing the quality and quantity of vocabulary and academic language use with English 
language learners (using the English 3D curriculum). Topics to be covered are: 1. Modeling 
proper use of academic language for ELLs 2. Using Tier 2 vocabulary in the classroom 3. 
Assessing ELLs' vocabulary knowledge 4. Integrating oral language scaffolds 5. Academic 
vocabulary across the content areas 6. Strategies to improve ELLs' listening skills 7. Elevating 
academic discourse in the ENL classroom 
 These two separate study groups will be held twice a month (alternating each week) from the 
beginning of October to the end of April. The study group participants will use the two separate 
curricula for the program as the starting focus for the study. Teachers will be asked to bring 
specific materials that may be useful for that week's topic of study. Strategy implementation will 
be discussed and asssessed. Reflections on student and teacher learning will be an additional part 
of the process with data being collected at the beginning, middle and the end of the program.

Rationale: 
  
At P.S./M.S. 057M, we believe that parental involvement creates a stronger community of 
learners and we strive to incorporate parents into all parts of our students' learning. Parents will 
be invited to the school prior to the onset of the Title III program for an orientation to the 
program. They will learn what their students will do in the Title III program, as well as strategies 
they can use to help their child's English language development including helpful hints such as 
television shows, such as jeopardy, wheel of fortune for family engagement. They will also be 
given information on the ENL programs available for parents throughout the city, including ENL 
for adults and programs hosted by the NYCDOE. Interpretation and translation will be provided 
to parents as needed. In June 2018, towards the end of the program, parents will be invited to 
celebrate the work of the students in the elementary and middle school programs. For example, 
the students will host a gallery walk to showcase their work throughout the year.  Students will 
present to their families and staff.  
Schedule and Duration: 
Parent will be invited to workshops at the school once a month for 1.5 hours.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Early literacy skills are assessed with Fountas and Pinnell. This assessment tool examines reading behaviors and ascertains the 
accuracy, fluency, and comprehension levels of students when reading a leveled text. Entering level ELLs are assessed on letter 
recognition, reading high frequency words, phonological awareness and other early literacy behaviors using additional 
assessments from the Fountas and Pinnell program. The data provides an insight into which ELLs are above-level, on-level and 
below-level. The overall trend across the grades shows that ELLs are either on-level or below-level in terms of reading. 
  
The data from the third grade ELLs highlights some of these trends. Students in the third grade should be reading book levels 
M-N at this point in the year. The results from the Fountas and Pinnell assessment show that, out of eleven third grade ELLs, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

two ELLs are reading on-level and nine are below-level. It should be noted, however, that six of the nine that are reading 
below-level are only one reading level behind and that two of the seven that are below-level are newcomer ELLs.  
  
Furthermore, the data from this assessment is used to homogeneously group students for intensive instruction to increase 
their reading levels. The reading behaviors gathered from Fountas and PInnell assessment help the classroom, bilingual, ENL, 
and special education teachers to hone in on language features that are hindering a student’s understanding when reading a 
text.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Students are bench marked three times a year using Fountas and Pinnell. The Fountas and Pinnell program is also used as our 
school's Measure of Student Learning end of year assessment.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We examine the success of our programs for ELLs not only by examining the test results from the NYSESLAT, New York State 
ELA, Math, Science (grades 4 and 8 only) and predictive and interim exams, but also by communicating with the students, 
parents, and teachers of the ELLs to track their improvement.  In evaluating the success of our programs for ELLs, our school 
decided to hire a third ENL teacher for the 2017-2018 school year. as well as open up a Dual Language program for grades K-2, 
with the intention of adding an additional Dual Language class in grades 3-8 each subsequent school year. These changes have 
strengthened our programs and led to higher numbers of ELLs becoming proficient in English. In addition, in line with new CR 
Part 154.2 mandates, even after ELLs exit the program, we continue to monitor the progress of the former ELLs by providing a 
minimum of 90 minutes of instruction per week for each student to follow their continued language and overall academic 
development.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We have a separate team that focuses solely on RTI for ELLs, which is made up of two ENL teachers and two special education 
teachers, and that meets biweekly to discuss ELLs who are struggling academically and to develop intervention plans for those 
students. The summative data and teacher progress reports are used to help develop the intervention plans. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our school has a team of teachers responsible for streamlining Response to Intervention (RTI) protocols in the school. The 
team consists of an Assistant Principal, a Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS), an IEP teacher, a Literacy 
Specialist, a School Psychologist, a Bilingual Speech Teacher, a Bilingual School Social Worker, and two ENL teachers. Although 
the RTI team manages the process, the protocols set in place are a school-wide initiative. The students are initially assessed in 
September in reading, writing, and math by the classroom teacher. The data is analyzed to identify at-risk students. These 
students are grouped based on targeted areas of need and instruction is differentiated in the classrooms to meet the needs of 
all learners. 
  
When high quality Tier 1 instruction does not seem to be working for some students, the teacher identifies the area of need 
and the student is pulled into a small group of students. The small group of students, which requires Tier 2 instruction then 
receives a letter home informing parents of this next phase of instruction as well as Tier 2 instruction for a six week cycle. If the 
student continues to struggle, the classroom teacher will request a meeting and discuss the case. At weekly meetings, the RTI 
team discusses cases that are of concern to classroom teachers and offers advice and suggestions to those teachers on 
strategies they can use to further target instruction. When Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruction do not work for a student, the student 
is pulled out for instruction in a group of 1-3 students. In Tier 3, the intervention provider will administer additional 
assessments to identify specific areas of need to target intervention. If Tier 3 instruction proves to be unsuccessful, the RTI 
reconvenes the case and discusses the next steps to be taken for the student to ensure his/her learning needs are being met 
and his/her future success.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The NYSITELL was administered to all newly enrolled students whose language on the HLIS was determined to be one other 
than English and who exhibited potential English as a Second Language acquisition needs during an informal interview. There 
are 15 students who were identified as ELLs based on the NYSITELL assessment. In this group, 11 students are in kindergarten. 
Based on the NYSITELL, the majority of the students identified as ELLs in Kindergarten are at the transitioning/expanding level, 
the two 1st grade ELLs, the one 2nd grade student and the one fourth-grade student also scored at the Entering level.  
  
The data from the 2016 NYSESLAT exam show that the majority of our ELL students are testing at the Transitioning or 
Expanding levels. About 15% of our ELL population has reached proficiency, or "tested out", as per the NYSESLAT exam, each 
year for the past two years. The data from the NYSESLAT, State ELA and Math exams is used when we program students and 
decide how to group them, in Title III program planning and in developing or implementing other special programs for ELLs at 
our school.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We disseminate the information to our administration on a biweekly basis at the beginning of the year, when that information 
is more transient and subject to change, and then as appropriate throughout the rest of the year. We meet with teachers once 
to twice a month at their grade meetings to disseminate the information as well, since we have ELLs and Former ELLs in every 
grade. Adjustments to programs are made at the end and at the beginning of the year in order to ensure students are 
programmed properly and in accordance with state mandates.

as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction for ELLs in the Freestanding ENL program is delivered through integrated and standalone ENL classes. 
Students who have scored in the Entering level are provided with 180 minutes  
of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA, students who scored at the Emerging level are 
provided with 90 minutes of standalone ENL, students who have scored at the Transitioning level are 
provided with 90 minutes of integrated ENL and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL, students who 
scored at the Expanding level receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL and students who scored at the 
Commanding level have 90 minutes of integrated ENL. In standalone ENL classes students are grouped 
heterogeneously and with not more than two contiguous grades in one class. In the integrated ENL classes, 
students are grouped based on the class they are in and the ENL teacher collaborates with the classroom 
teacher(s) to plan ELA lessons that incorporate the needs of ELLs and former ELLs as well as other 
students. In the integrated model, the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher co-teach the lesson planned, 
 by differentiating instruction, working together to deliver the mini-lesson incorporating ENL strategies and then 
pulling a small group of ELLs and FELLs to work with the ENL teacher, or pulling the small group of ELLs initially and 
delivering the same mini lesson to them as is given to the whole class.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Our school does not have a TBE program at this time.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

ENL Instruction in the Dual Language program is provided by a teacher certified in Bilingual Education. Students are 
grouped according to the teacher's discretion in various ways including heterogeneous and  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

homogeneous groupings. The Bilingual certified teacher in each class provides integrated or standalone  
ENL services to students according to their levels and corresponding CR Part 154.2 mandates.  
Bilingual teachers also provide the Home Language Arts classes as well as content area classes in Spanish. 
Students who scored at Entering or Emerging levels receive two bilingual content area subjects while  
students who scared at Transitioning or Expanding levels receive one bilingual content area subject.  

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Administration ensures the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in the Dual 
Language program. Administration has worked closely with the Dual Language class teachers to determine the structure of the 
program, including when Home Language Arts and ENL is provided as well as how ENL is provided based on different 
proficiency levels within the class. The decisions for how the program is structured and how instructional units of study are 
provided are based on the new CR Part 154.2 mandates. Similarly, administration works with the ENL teachers to ensure that 
all students are receiving the instructional minutes they require based on CR Part 154.2 mandates. In the ENL program, ELL 
students are grouped into the least number of classes possible for the grade they are in, and in most cases, they are grouped 
into not more than two classes. This enables the ENL teachers to provide all  students with the number of instructional 
minutes they need according to their proficiency levels.  
  
Grouping English Language Learners into two or less classes per grade in the Freestanding ENL model enables ENL teachers to 
provide 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL to any students at the Entering level, 90 minutes of 
standalone or integrated ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL to any students at the Emerging level, 90 minutes of 
integrated ENL and 90 minutes of either integrated ENL or standalone ENL to any students at the Transitioning level, 180 
minutes of integrated ENL to students at the Expanding level, and 90 minutes of integrated ENL to students who have tested at 
the Commanding level. This grouping also facilitates the co-planning and co-teaching necessary amongst ENL teachers and 
classroom teachers to effectively service ELL students. 
  
ENL Instruction in the Dual Language program is provided by the Bilingual teacher. Bilingual teachers also provide the Home 
Language Arts classes as well as content area classes in Spanish. In the Dual Language program, students receive 180 minutes 
of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL to any students at the Entering level, 90 minutes of standalone or 
integrated ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL to any students at the Emerging level, 90 minutes of integrated ENL and 90 
minutes of either integrated ENL or standalone ENL to any students at the Transitioning level, 180 minutes of integrated ENL 
to students at the Expanding level, and 90 minutes of integrated ENL to students who have tested at the Commanding 
level.  Students who scored at Entering or Emerging levels receive two bilingual content area subjects while students who 
scared at Transitioning or Expanding levels receive one bilingual content area subject. 
  
  
  
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Core content is delivered in every class possible for ELLs, regardless of whether they have been placed in Freestanding ENL 
classes or Dual Language classes. The ability to make core content comprehensible to ELLs and providing equal access to all 
content to all students is of paramount importance to our school community. As differentiated instruction has been our 
instructional focus for the past two years, all of our teachers have dedicated countless professional development hours and 
planning time to providing high quality differentiated instruction to all students, including English Language Learners. In ENL 
classes, core content is made to be comprehensible to ELLs through a variety of ENL strategies such as using native language 
supports, activating prior knowledge, TPR, repetition, front-loading vocabulary, modeling, scaffolding, using visuals and graphic 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

organizers, student grouping, and by differentiating instruction, among others. Collaboration with classroom teachers is also 
vital to ensuring all ELLs have access to the same content as their peers. In the Dual Language classes, teachers use similar 
strategies to foster language development while meeting the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards. However, 
Dual Language teachers also us home language supports when appropriate. In addition, the availability of Home Language Arts 
as well as content area subjects in their native language for students in the Dual Language program emphasizes the 
importance of their first language in a cultural sense as well as in an academic sense. This enables students to have a strong 
language base upon which they can more easily build their second language skills.      
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

ELLs are in the Dual Language classes are informally evaluated in their home languages at various points throughout the year 
by the Dual Language teachers via teacher observations, questioning, discussion, exit slips, quizzes and tests, graphic 
organizers during Home Language Arts. Dual LanguageTeachers formally evaluate their students' home language development 
by giving them program tests, or teacher-made tests, several times a year, and comparing students' language development 
with that of their peers. In the Freestanding ENL program, Entering and Emerging ELLs are formally assessed in their home 
languages using teacher-made language exams once at the beginning of the year and once at the end of the year. More 
advanced ELLs are tested informally twice a year in their home language, using observations, questioning, and writing tasks, 
though less frequently, and at the discretion of the ENL or classroom teacher.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. We currently have one SIFE student at this time. Instruction is differentiated to 
include many visuals, language prompts and sentence starters, graphic organizers, audio books if necessary. 
We also provide a supportive environment that responds to the immediate social, cultural and linguistic  
needs of this SIFE student that lowers the affective filter so that students feel more comfortable 
participating in all academic activities. Our teaching staff has on-going training in cross-cultural 
communication and instructional methods designed to improve the academic achievement of SIFE students. We have created 
a collaborative instructional model that reinforces student learning and accelerates the academic progress of our 
SIFE student.  
 
b. Newcomer ELLs are grouped together for standalone ENL classes with an ENL teacher. Instruction  
is differentiated after analyzing students' scores in Reading, Writing, Listening and Speaking on  
the NYSESLAT exam and modifying activities so that students learn what is comprehensible to them at  
their respective level. Instruction is differentiated by providing various scaffolding techniques to ensure 
students are able to participate in any lesson regardless of their language level. Techniques include using 
visuals, gesturing and using Total Physical Response, graphic organizers, sentence starters, teacher modeled 
expectations, group work, increasing comprehensible input and sheltered instruction, and providing intensive 
literacy and language instruction, and teaching students specific language based learning strategies  
that they can apply throughout their academic career.  
 
c./d./e. Developing, Long Term ELLs, and Former ELLs are grouped heterogenously and are provided  
with integrated ENL services whenever possible. Some of the heterogenous grouping occurs within the Dual 
Language program classes. Instruction is differentiated using various scaffolding techniques, such as those mentioned above, 
along with providing them with a print-rich environment, activating prior knowledge, fostering the development of students 
academic vocabulary and academic oral language, and providing opportunities for 
group work whenever possible.      
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELL-SWDs are provided with the same grade-level materials as their peers, although the materials may be modified at times to 
be more comprehensible for the student. Instructional strategies used to enhance the 
comprehension of ELL-SWDs are activating prior knowledge, modeling, repetition, using visuals whenever 
possible, writing out directions, chunking text, front-loading vocabulary, using graphic organizers, and pulling 
small groups of students for direct instruction.  In grades 3-8, Expeditionary Learning and Go Math are used for all students in 
grades 3-8. In grades K-2, Fundations, Journeys and Go Math are used. In addition, ENL, general and special education teachers 
determine language goals for each student and work to strengthen language skills within content area teaching. Technology is 
also used to support ELLs, such as Smartboards, laptops and iPads.   
 
In addition to the regular curriculum for ELA, our school also uses two other programs which were written specifically for 
ELLs by Dr. Kate Kinsella-- The Academic Vocabulary Toolkit and English 3D. Both of these programs were designed 
to accelerate the English language development for English Language Learners. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our school enables ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the  
least restrictive environment by modifying the content of the curriculum when necessary, aligning  
language goals to IEP goals whenever possible, working collaboratively with administration, school  
social workers, psychologists, general and special education teachers to determine student progress,  
and being flexible in changing goals to reflect the student's current needs.  
 
In addition, the ENL teachers are members of the SIT/RTI team and are involved with advocating for the needs of ELL-SWDs to 
ensure that all teachers working with them are aware of their second language needs and how to differentiate these needs 
from their learning disability. It is also a priority goal of this team to ensure that ELLs are properly identified as SWDs and are 
not put in more restrictive settings than necessary due to their second language acquisition needs. This is done through 
different academic interventions are tried because ELLs may have different learning styles and may access the curriculum 
through different means.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
In the Dual Language program (Grades K-2) the bilingual instructors often include native language vocabulary into their 
content lessons to assist in the students’ comprehension of the specialized English content vocabulary. This is done so that the 
students’ L1 vocabulary skills transfer to their L2. This is done not only for ELA, but in math, science, and social studies as well. 
For Grades 4-8, the ELLs also receive specialized academic vocabulary instruction prior to moving on to the next unit in Math, 
Social Studies, ELA, and Science. The vocabulary is front-loaded and glossaries are given to assist students in better being able 
to grasp their content subjects as the school year progresses. Content vocabulary is taught in Math prior to math units. This 
fall, the middle school math teachers and ENL teacher are attending a PD on the topic of: supporting ELLs in math instruction. 
For intervention in science, vocabulary is also front-loaded from the Academic Vocabulary Toolkit. The middle school science 
teacher and middle school ENL teacher are also attending a PD on the topic of: supporting ELLs in the science classroom. 
The ENL teacher also works with classroom teachers to give language tools (vocabulary lists, modified texts, modified 
assignments) to help students achieve the standards in all content subjects. During ENL instruction in both elementary 
and middle school, the students work with the Academic Vocabulary Toolkit to focus on specialized academic vocabulary for 
each subject individually - math, history, science, and ELA/writing. This toolkit has provided a wonderful way for older ELLs to 
“own” content vocabulary that is shared across all subject areas. With the exception of the Dual Language program, in which 
vocabulary and grammar is taught in both English and Spanish, all instruction is monolingual (English).   
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

PS 57 has introduced a Positive Behavioral & Intervention Support (PBIS) model school-wide. PBIS is a program that 
encourages and rewards positive behavior. The model also provides a way of monitoring and addressing the behaviors of 
students who need guidance in following the rules set forth by the school community. This program will be improved upon and 
expanded in the coming 2017-2018 school year. 
  
PS 57 is also continuing with their participation in the R.E.A.D. program (Reading Educational Assistance Dogs). The mission of 
R.E.A.D. is to improve the literacy skills of children through the assistance of registered therapy teams as literacy mentors. The 
Reading Education Assistance Dogs program improves children's reading and communication skills by employing a powerful 
method: reading to an animal. R.E.A.D. companions are registered therapy animals who volunteer with their owner/handlers 
as a team, going to schools, libraries and many other settings as reading companions for children. R.E.A.D. is the first and 
foremost program that utilizes therapy animals to help kids improve their reading and communication skills and also teaches 
them to love books and reading. This year we will be enrolling the 3rd grade bilingual class in this program, giving them a 
chance to participate bi-weekly in this program.  
  
Furthermore, PS 57 is working to expand co-teaching models and strengthen the collaboration between classroom teachers 
and the ENL teachers who conduct stand-alone and integrated instruction. This collaboration strengthens instruction and 
allows students to get additional support in the content areas.  A PD cycle will be offered to general education teachers with 
ELLs in their classrooms to learn more about ELL strategies in order to enable them to better support ELLs when an ENL 
teacher is not present.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

PS 57 continues to provide programs and services to all populations at the school, including English Language Learners. This 
past year (2016-2017) we opened a Spanish-English Dual Language program at our school which replaced our Transitional 
Bilingual Education program.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
PS 57 offers a plethora of after-school enrichment and remediation activities. PS 57 offers an ELL Enrichment Academy for 
elementary and middle school students. The ELL Enrichment Academy for 3rd-5th grade students will begin in November and 
will run through May. The classes will meet two days a week after school. One bilingual teachers and two ENL teachers will 
work with small groups of students to develop language skills through word games, leveled readings, literature, and vocabulary 
building skills. The ELL Enrichment program is targeted toward Expanding ELLs to increase their academic language proficiency 
through a variety of texts. They will learn test preparation skills to help them pass the NYSESLAT and succeed in their academic 
classes. 
 
Other programs include YMCA, basketball, track and field, drumline, cheerleading, the Voices of 57 choir, Hunter Learning Lab, 
and the Roads to Success program, many of which ELLs are enrolled in as any non-ELL student would be.            
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
PS 57 follows the balanced literacy model as the core curriculum in grades Kindergarten through 8th grade in Expeditionary 
Learning. Kindergarten to Grade Two follows the Olivia Wahl’s units of study based on the reading and writing workshop 
model. In grades Kindergarten through Grade Five, Go Math! is used as the math core curriculum. Our science curriculum 
stresses both the content area literacy as well as hands-on experience in the science lab. In social studies, students learn about 
relevant topics in small groups supported by their teacher to maximize the learning experience. 
  
ENL curriculum materials include the Language Power curriculum, Practice Exercises in Basic English, Phonics for Reading, the 
Academic Vocabulary Toolkit and English 3D. These resources are leveled by grade range and language proficiency. Students 
are assessed to correctly match the materials by proficiency or grade to the appropriate levels. 
  
Technology is used in the classroom to enhance instruction whenever possible. There are laptops carts available to both the 
elementary and middle school ELLs, and most classrooms have Smartboards. Grades 6-8 have one “Technology” period a week 
in which they are able to use laptops to perform activities related to Social Studies or ELA. Some teachers also have access to 
document readers and iPads, which are often used for small group instruction with ELLs.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language instruction and support is provided for our ELLs. In the Dual Language program, offered in Grades K-2 bilingual 
teachers deliver the instruction in all subjects in both English and Spanish. Native language literacy (Spanish) is taught and 
emphasized in conjunction with their ELA unit. In the ENL program, we provide native language support and instruction in the 
school community whenever possible since we recognize the importance of the transfer effect from the first language to 
second language, as well as the cultural connection to the students. In addition, we offer the foreign language classes in 
Spanish to the middle school to help students develop and maintain their home language.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

At PS 57, teachers are aware that lessons must be targeted towards the age and grade of our ELL population. Since we have a 
Dual Language program for Grades K-2, bilingual teachers are able to incorporate scaffolding, native language support, and 
emphasis on producing oral language.  The curriculum resources we use are grade-level appropriate, and despite the English 
proficiency of each ELL, the materials they use are the same as the rest of their peers; the instruction for ELLs is heavily 
scaffolded to help them achieve the same standards as their English monolingual classmates. Teachers assess students so that 
the materials are matched to students’ language and grade levels. As part of the school’s RtI (Response to Intervention) 
program, in addition to receiving the appropriate ENL and bilingual services, their classroom teachers also work with struggling 
students in small groups and one-on-one to help them make progress to close the learning gap and achieve grade standards. 
 
Our school also ensures that all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels by requiring 
teachers to include the appropriate Common Core State Standards for students in their lesson plans. Teachers ensure that the 
activities and resources used in their lessons correspond to the CCSS standards so that all students, including ELLs have access 
to the curriculum.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
PS/MS 57 follows the balanced literacy model as the core curriculum in grades Kindergarten through 8th grade in 
Expeditionary Learning. This is intentional to make ELA instruction seamless as elementary age students move up to the middle 
school. Kindergarten to Grade Two follows the Olivia Wahl’s units of study based on the reading and writing workshop model. 
In grades Kindergarten through Grade Five, Go Math! is used as the math core curriculum. Our science curriculum stresses 
both the content area literacy as well as hands-on experience in the science lab. In social studies, students learn about relevant 
topics in small groups supported by their teacher to maximize the learning experience. 
  
ENL curriculum materials include the Language Power curriculum, Meet the Masters Art History, Phonics for Reading, the 
Academic Vocabulary Toolkit (Book 1), and English 3D. These resources are leveled by grade range and language proficiency. 
Students are assessed to correctly match the materials by proficiency or grade to the appropriate levels. 
  
Technology is used in the classroom to enhance instruction whenever possible. There is a computer lab available for both the 
elementary and middle school ELLs, and many classrooms have smartboards. Grades 6-8 have one “Technology” period a week 
in which they are able to use laptops to perform activities related to Social Studies or ELA. Some teachers also have access to 
document readers and iPads, which are often used for small group instruction with ELLs.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
The administration, parent coordinator, and ENL teachers work together to acclimate newly enrolled ELLs before school 
begins. The parent coordinator is actively involved in reaching out to these families and inviting them to an “Orientation” 
meeting in August before school begins. At this meeting, we outline the programs available (ENL or Dual Language) and offer 
parental choice as to what program they think works best for their child’s needs. For new ELLs who enroll throughout the year, 
the same orientation meeting is offered on an individual basis, held by the ENL teachers, in which parents are welcomed to the 
school and taught about the various literacy models offered to students acquiring English as a second language. During 
Tuesday afternoon teacher professional development time, the ENL and bilingual teachers have designated time to reach out 
to parents of new ELLs to catch them up on their child’s progress and reach out to them with concerns or questions regarding 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

 

their child’s learning. Parents are always encouraged to work at home with their child on their native language so as to prevent 
L1 language loss as they gain English skills across all modalities.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

The middle school students take Spanish as a second language twice a week, as part of the school’s initiative to foster and 
encourage students to use their native language in an academic school setting as well as in their homes.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

a. We use the self-contained model and our IEPs and ELLs are integrated 100% of the day.  
b. All content areas are taught in English and Spanish.  
c. We use the roller coaster model so that English is used in the mornings and Spanish is used in the 
afternoons on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and Spanish is used in the mornings and English is used 
in the afternoons on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  
d. Currently, emergent literacy is being taught in both languages at the same time.  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
ENL teachers and bilingual teachers at PS 57 are provided coverage to attend one all-day professional development provided 
by the NYC DOE meeting every six weeks, or on an as-needed basis. Teachers are encouraged to attend professional 
developments geared toward ELL compliance, ELL strategies in the classroom, ENL across content areas, and various other ELL 
topics. 
  
In the school year 2017-2018, all staff (guidance counselors, secretaries, and administration) at PS 57 will participate in 
professional development opportunities to strengthen instruction for the ELL population. These sessions will be facilitated by 
invited staff developers from Generation Ready, the Academic Vocabulary Toolkit, Muttigrees, the Manhattan Field Support 
Team (ELL Start-up Committee), Learning Partners Program, RTI/SIT Team Meetings, and ENL/Bilingual teachers) will be invited 
to participate in these sessions and will then conduct  turnkey trainings to share the new information and strategies with the 
remainder of the staff who teach  ELL populations. The ENL teacher will also provide training for classroom teachers during 
grade meeting planning times which are held on a weekly basis, This will allow us to meet the requirements of 15% PD hours of 
training. The topics of these trainings will involve Collaborations and Co-Teaching, Implications of the NYSESLAT, Applying the 
Common Core Standards to ELLs, Long Term ELLs, and ENL Strategies for ELLs. 
 
In order to help teachers of ELLs support their students as they engage in the Common Core, professional development, the 
ENL and bilingual teachers will attend a professional development meeting this fall regarding the Bilingual Common Core 
which they will then turn key to the entire school in a two-part Monday professional development time at the school. 
Standards and ways to assess ELLs’ progress will be shared with all school staff so they can effectively support ELLs as they 
engage in rigorous Common Core schoolwork.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include

how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Since PS 57 is a K-8 school, ELLs are given continued support by both the ENL teachers as well as the classroom teachers they 
partner with to give students support as they transition to middle school.  
 t this time, PS 57 assists ELLs transitioning to high school by helping them locate schools with programs that will suit their 
language needs. The PS 57 guidance counselor attends trainings throughout the city about the process of helping students find 
the "right" school for them, and act as the main support in the school for students transitioning to middle and high school. For 
students who are at the Transitioning or Emerging level, we seek to find schools with a heavy bilingual demographic and 
foreign language classes offered to suit their needs. ENL teachers also pay close attention to the interests and strengths of our 
8th grade ELLs and try to help them locate a school with a mission and focus that mirrors their interests to help them succeed. 
Throughout the school year, the bilingual and ENL teachers at PS 57 attend professional development meetings offered by 
District 4 and the DELLs office. The goal is for teachers to attend an average of one full-day professional development meeting 
a month. This gives bilingual and ENL teacher more than a 50% professional development focus on ELL specific instruction. 
Based on what teachers learn at these professional development meetings, they are offering weekly sessions during the 
Tuesday mandated professional development time after school to turn key information to classroom teachers of ELLs. During 
this Tuesday time, various topics throughout the year will include: CR Part 154 regulations, scaffolding for ELLs, academic 
language and vocabulary, writing for ELLs, how to distinguish language acquisition from learning disability, how to help a 
beginner ELL in your class, RTI for ELLs, how to assist ELLs with IEPs, etc. Attendance is taken at the weekly ENL Professional 
Development meetings, and teachers at PS 57 are asked to attend a minimum of 10 sessions to meet the mandated hours for 
ENL-specific professional development.    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
By holding a meeting about the NYSESLAT both at the start of the school year in September and again in March before the 
exam is given, parents are fully armed with the information they need to understand what their child’s academic language 
goals are in order to be able to succeed. Additionally, they gain a better idea of the support their student is getting through the 
bilingual/ENL program at PS 57. Along with the two ENL department meetings, parent-teacher conferences are held twice a 
year, in November and again in March. Parents of all ELLs are invited to visit with their child’s bilingual/ENL teacher at these 
meetings to review progress their student have made with their English acquisition, as well as  areas in which they are still 
seeking to improve.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parents hold an integral part of our school and the ENL/Bilingual program. PS 57 has an active Parent Association that provides 
a variety of workshops and events for parents. The parent coordinator at the school works closely with the Parent 
Association to mediate the needs of the school and the needs of the parent, and helps to create a healthy partnership 
between the school and the home. As someone who speaks both Spanish and English, she acts as a translator at many parent 
meetings. When a language other than Spanish is spoken,  the NYC Translation Interpretation Unit is utilized. The Parent 
Association hosts weekly ENL classes for parents to learn English. We also organize a Bring Your Father to School Day, a 
Grandparents Day, and a Women’s Wellness Day dedicated for moms. These events are intended to help parents be more 
involved with their students’ academic lives and be present in the classroom environment. Parents are also strongly 
encouraged to volunteer to help with school art projects and various duties. As a community, the parents are welcomed 
participants on field trips, school shows, and other activities. In the fall, the ENL department hosts a meeting for all parents of 
ELLs to attend and find out how their child performed on the NYSESLAT the previous spring and what they can do at home to 
help their child prepare for the next exam. Strategies are shared for exercises they can do at home with their child to help 
them improve their language skills, which includes native language instruction from the parent when possible. In March, the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72 

 

 

ENL department will hold a workshop for parents to help them understand the implications of the NYSESLAT and how they can 
help their children study and prepare at home.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lorraine Hasty, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The language preferences of the parent community for both written and oral communication is identified at the 
time of registration, when parents fill out a form that specifically asks them the language of which they prefer to 
receive correspondence from the school. Additionally, parents request oral and written communication 
preferences on Part III of the Home Language Identification survey, on Student Emergency Contact cards, and on 
an additional survey kept by the ENL department. This information is contained within the Cumulative Folders in 
each teacher's classroom, so there is a record of the preferred home language for each child. The Student 
Emergency Contact cards also mirror the language preference, and are available in the main office for 
administration and the secretarial staff to use. At this time at PS 57, communication is sent home in the following 
preferred languages: English, Spanish, Bengali, and Chinese. Phone communication is also handled in English and 
Spanish, as well as in-person translation when required.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76 

 
 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Our school has a team appointed by the Language Access Coordinator whose members carry out different roles in the 
event of an emergency. The team consists of two ENL teachers, one parent association member, a Special education 
teacher, a general education teacher and a member of the Main Office staff. Each team member is in charge of one or 
two languages spoken by parents at our school and has the job of translating the message for the parent as quickly as 
possible to get the word out about the emergency in a timely fashion. For extreme emergencies which cannot wait a 
few minutes for a perfectly translated message, the team has compiled various emergency messages in the different 
languages spoken by the parents explaining the nature of the emergency and asking parents to contact the school for 
more information.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78 

 

 

At our staff orientation early in September, our Parent Coordinator/Language Access Coordinator meets with the staff 
to provide them with information about her role as LAC as well as to provide information about the Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663. It is at this meeting where she explains the resources available to teachers and other staff members 
which help to meet compliance mandates. In addition, the school's two ENL teachers are both trained Language 
Access Coordinators and assist the Parent Coordinator in meeting with teachers at grade meetings throughout year to 
further explain compliance rules and the Chancellor's Regulation A-663 goal.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Our school has all the notification requirements for parents in place. In addition, parents are made aware of the 
availability of translation and interpretation services at scheduled parent meetings. In the office we have the NYC DOE 
Welcome Poster hanging with all 10 of the most common languages in New York on display. If communication issues 
arise due to language differences, parents are allowed to request translation in their home language. When parents 
request a translated version of written documents in a language other than Spanish, we contact the Translation and 
Interpretation Services through the DOE. This is unusual, but on the occasion that it does happen we are prepared to 
do so through our trained Language Access Coordinator.  

 

Any correspondence sent out by our school is sent out in English and Spanish, including phone blasts or text 
messages, the annual handbook, newsletters, calendars, parent-teacher conference announcements, after-school 
program information, New York State testing dates, curriculum issues, letters from school leadership, and any other 
announcements that need to be made. These letters, phone calls, and announcements are distributed to families at 
various times throughout the year. In the event that translation is needed for any document other than English or 
Spanish, translation services will be contacted 2-4 weeks in advance to translate documents. When parents request a 
translated version of written documents in a language other than Spanish, we contact the Translation and 
Interpretation Services through the DOE.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school will take a survey at the end of the year asking parents to provide feedback on the quality and availability 
of services in order to make provisions if necessary for the 2017-2018 school year.  

 

We are currently collecting feedback from limited-English proficient parents regarding the language services from the 
2016-2017 school year, and will review and make adjustments per the survey suggestions.
