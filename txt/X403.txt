Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

Bronx International High School is a progressive, team-based and community-based school. We are dedicated to 
serving the academic and social needs of recently immigrated young people and their families. Our mission is to 
enhance our students’ cultural awareness, English and native language proficiencies, and intellectual and 
collaborative abilities. These skills will empower them to become active participants in today’s interdependent and 
diverse world. By critically analyzing and responding to complex world issues, students will achieve academic, 
personal, and professional success, as they become advocates for themselves and their communities. 

 

 

 
 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

● Our school’s instructional approach in educating English language learners has always been rooted in the INPS 
tenets of heterogeneity, experiential learning, language and content integration and collaboration. Incorporating 
these tenets not only allows us to facilitate the development of language skills but also support critical thinking, 
communication skills, and college/career readiness goals. Teachers have worked in discipline teams to reassess the 
scope and sequence for each discipline to refine, align, and incorporate elements of CCLS as well as the Danielson 
Framework. 

● Teachers utilize an online mastery based assessment system to provide students with ongoing feedback. Through 
this system students, teachers, and parents are able provide clear expectations and can identify areas where the 
student may require extra help or tutoring. In addition, teachers also use formative assessment to measure students’ 
progress in the obtainment of a goal to inform instruction and respond to student needs. We are looking to extend 
these systems through the Haiku platform and with 1-1 access to computers provided by the Apple grant.  

● Being the recipients of the Apple grant as part of the ConnectED Program we will be shifting our instructional 
practices and collaborative efforts to a web based system of communication and feedback. This grant provides 
student with 1-1 computers, vastly altering how teachers design instruction and assessment. This will further enable 
teachers to provide more individualized supports and extensions for all students. Students will be able to work at their 
own pace, giving advanced students the opportunity to extend their learning independently and providing struggling 
students with extra support from their teachers. Students can collaborate on projects online and manage their own 
time-lines for completion. 

 

 Bronx International HS excels in the Collaborative Teachers element of the frame work : Teachers are committed to 
the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in 
professional development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

Across the school, teacher teams methodically analyze and use student and teacher work and data, to inform key 
decisions that affect student learning across grades and content areas. The strategic work of teacher teams guides 
instructional decisions that ensure student mastery of goals and strengthen the school’s instructional practice. 
Leadership structures are rooted in building teacher capacity essential to leveraging instructional changes across

statements, deeper analysis of complex text, and insightful connections. The work of teacher teams informs the 
school’s partnership with the Consortium and Internationals Network for Public Schools and in creating standard-
based graduation portfolio units and aligning the common core student work to that of the Consortium.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Bronx International High School serves approximately 403 students, 93% of whom are English Language Learners. Our 
school's mission is to serve students who have recently arrived in the United States and are struggling with separation 
from their homeland and families and acclimating to the United States. They need to learn the English language and 
the content required to graduate high school at the same time. They also need careful social and emotional supports. 
They need extended time with the same team of teachers to build relationships and they need explicit English 
instruction in content area subjects.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Area of focus  

School leaders consistently communicate high expectations to the school community, encourage ongoing feedback, 
and hold a system of accountability. There is a focus on working together with families and their understanding of the 
school’s expectations, their roles and support. School leaders and staff promote high expectations and offer its 
constituents support toward meeting those expectations. However, the school is in the process of extending its 
responsibility to its families to ensure that in partnership families and students fully understand the school’s 
expectations linked to college and career preparation.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As a new consortium school we have developed PBATs for all of our core subjects as a graduation path for all our 
students. The tasks are aligned to the PBATs rubrics standard. In order to achieve this we must continue working on 
following: 

 

Continue working on aligning curricula to Common Core and content Standards and integrate key instructional shifts in 
tasks, regularly using student work to make curricular refinements. The school will continue to make purposeful 
decisions to ensure coherence of units of study across content areas informed by student work analysis creating access 
to all diverse learners. 

 

Content area teachers align scope and sequence to the Common Core Learning Standards and integrate key 
instructional shifts in cycles of learning. Teachers have done a crosswalk between the All subjects for grades 9-12 scope

and sequence and the Common Core Learning Standards, aligning them in every band for each grade level. Common 
core related skills align in the same manner as the scope and sequence moves up through the grade levels.  

Needs: 

Content area teacher teams will work together to reassess the scope and sequence for each subject and to refine, align, 
and integrate key instructional shifts. Teachers will memorialize their yearly curriculum maps on Google docs to share 
across grades and content areas.  

Curriculum maps will include a column highlighting common core alignment to indicate where the unit and lesson plans 
appropriately bridge to standards. Teachers will also post their units, and daily lesson plans illustrating common core 
alignment. 

Teachers will refine curriculum and instruction to develop a common language, build conceptual understanding, and 
literacy practices incorporated into lessons, so staff and students are be able to use and understand the work in spite of 
the student’s linguistic abilities.  

All lesson plans will include common core standards, a language objective, flexible groupings, differentiation and skills 
objectives that will be learned or explored. Also included are assessments, a procedure, aim, a “prepare and model”, a 
group practice, a share and a wrap-up or summary. Built into unit study and lesson plans are scaffolds, annotation 
techniques, multiple graphic organizers, writing prompts and transition words. 
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all Teachers will create at least one PBAT fully aligned to the Consortium rubric which would allow all 
students graduate with 4 academic PBATs and the ELA Regents .

 
  How to scaffold the research process? 

Integration of technology 

Across the school, teacher teams methodically analyze student work and data resulting from teachers planned curricula, 
to inform key decisions that affect student learning across grades and content areas. The strategic work of teacher 
teams guides instructional decisions that ensure student mastery of goals and strengthen the school’s instructional 
practice. Leadership structures are rooted in building teacher capacity essential to leveraging instructional changes 
across the school. Teacher teams meet twice per week to examine student work, refine academic tasks to fully align

Consortium and Internationals Network for Public Schools and in creating standard-based graduation portfolio units and 
aligning the common core student work to that of the Consortium.  

 

While we have 81% student attendance 49% are designated chronically absent. During the 2017-2018 school year, our 
attendance ranged from around 88% in our junior institute (9th and 10th grade) to 84 and 75% in our senior institute (11th 
and 12th grades).  

This year: 

Bronx International HS will focus on the 2018-19 11th graders, to ensure that we do not see the 10% drop in their 
attendance as they move through the 12th grade in 2019-20. Our theory is that weak student/teacher and 
student/school connections in 11th grade discourage students from continuing with their education in the 12th grade. 
We will also focus on creating conversations not only in Service Learning/advisory, but also in classrooms through the 
lens of curriculum. The goal of this is to reinforce what is happening in SL/advisory groups to create a sustainable, well 
rounded attendance program. When students realize that their counselors are not the only ones teaching them/talking 
to them about attendance, they may become more invested in themselves. 

 

Mentoring Plan for Senior 

All 12th graders will have a mentor for their portfolio graduation projects. They will meet once a week during the school 
day with a mentor on their interdisciplinary team to ensure there are expertise in all subjects. 

 

 

Advisory Plan 

Counselors will cycle through the Service Learning (similar to advisory) groups for their team(s), running circles focused 
on various aspects of absenteeism and attendance. 

 

The type and degree of intervention needed varies within the grade/teams. Through advisory circles, counselors will 
discuss various scenarios with prompts which will open conversation to the class. 

 

In addition to our advisory plan, we will continue to piloting a program with the 11th graders and their teachers. Our plan 
is to start the school year building a sense of community within the 11th grade. As three 10th grade teams merge 
together to form the 11th grade, it is not uncommon for students to stick with whomever was on their team in the 
previous years. We would like to give students and teachers an opportunity to know one another outside of the school

setting before delving in to the intensity and rigor of 11th grade academics. We believe it is crucial for the teachers to see 
the 11th graders as young people, before they experience them as 11th grade learners. 

To meet this end, students and teachers will spend 2 days at the Stony Acres Lodge and Wildlife Sanctuary. There they 
will participate in a wide variety of activities such as community building games, the low ropes course which requires 
students and teachers to depend on one another, communicate well and generally trust their community. In addition, 
the team will participate in the high ropes course and finally, there will be communal cooking and cleaning for each 
meal. The activities are run and debriefed by the staff at Stony Acres.  

 

The guidance team will follow up with other planned activities each month to promote participation and attendance of 
students as well as student/teacher community building.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 4: Teacher Practices 
and Decisions)

Tenet 4 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
4.2  School and teacher leaders ensure that instructional practices and strategies are organized 

around annual, unit, and daily lesson plans that address all student goals and needs. 

4.3  Teachers provide coherent, and appropriately aligned Common Core Learning Standards 

(CCLS)-based instruction that leads to multiple points of access for all students. 

4.4  Teachers and students work together to implement a program/plan to create a learning 

environment that is responsive to students’ varied experiences and tailored to the strengths 
and needs of all students.

4.5  Teachers inform planning and foster student participation in their own learning process by 
using a variety of summative and formative data sources (e.g., screening, interim measures, 
and progress monitoring). 
Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Teacher teams meet twice per week to examine student work, refine academic tasks to fully align them to Performance-
Based Academic Tasks ( PBATS ) that ensures students understand expectations for rigor in thesis statements, deeper 
analysis of complex text, and insightful connections. The work of teacher teams informs the school’s partnership with 
Internationals Network for Public Schools and Consortium in creating standard-based graduation portfolio units and 
aligning the common core student work to that of the Internationals Network. 

Grade teams use a, “Looking at Student Work Collaborative Analysis Protocol”, to analyze student strengths and needs, 
such as what the work shows that students are able to do and what is missing in the work in relation to the outcome. 
Teams measure how their assessment opportunities show student thinking, knowledge, skills acquired, and mastery of 
goals. An example of student mastery for grade expectations and expected graduation dates is data from the school's 
most recent Quality Snapshot (2016-17) citing 83% of students in grade 9 and 84% of students in grade 10 earned 
enough credits to be on track for high school graduation. There was decreased in this two metrics from the 2017-18 
Snapshot. 

 

● Teacher teams will use outcome based learning reflections, a process to discuss the percentage of passing rates, to 
plan and implement changes, and design next instructional strategies. For instance, during a teacher team meeting, 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           25 

 

teachers will discuss providing multiple opportunities for students to share their understanding and engage in 
productive struggle via writing an explanation of their work, showing their work, or in mathematics by computational 
work products. 

 

 

● During a teacher team meeting a mathematics teacher presented a brief background of student work. The teacher 
submitted a mathematics vignette to show three students’ understanding of a problem presented requiring them to 
examine an accompanying box and whisker plot indicating the cost of 12 CD’s in dollars. Students were asked to decide 
if the statements made were true. The team then engaged in an analysis of what the students were able to do and what 
was missing. The student data showed that the first student was able to articulate an explanation of his work. The 
second student was able to identify what was right and what was wrong, but lacked justification and the third student 
was able to identify the maximum and the minimum range with justification. The team reflections include vocabulary 
expansion and instructional adjustments on justification. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal  

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

After analyzing the “Framework for Great Schools” Report for 2017 our administrative team discussed that a strength in 
our school is that our administration works collaboratively with our faculty, parents, and students to develop a climate 
of inclusiveness and to inspire staff and students with a clear vision for student achievement. However, in considering 
our next steps we looked at areas in the “Framework for Great Schools” that we have new initiatives. For example, one 
area that we are working on is the implementation of our new one to one I-pad APPLE ConnectED grant program to 
create coherent instruction across the school through professional development, communication and collaboration 
between teachers and administration as well as teacher to teacher.  This will be guided to support the vision below: 

  We are not only content teachers and language/literacy teachers but in order to meet the 21st century needs of 

our students we must also strive to be media literacy teachers. 

  Therefore we are requiring that all teachers teach 2 lessons of Common Sense curriculum before the device roll-

out and to work throughout the year to integrate more technology into the curriculum.

  Using Common Sense will allow teachers to develop comfort with using and discussing technology in class 

without having to design lessons from scratch. Hopefully engaging in these lessons will allow teachers to 
eventually transfer some of these skills to their content areas.  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the

A committee is selected to review and select the State and Local Assessments that would be used for evaluation and 
improvement of instruction purposes. The committee comprised of both teachers and administrators (selected by the 
principal and UFT representative) met twice during the summer and once at the start of the school year to discuss 
which measures were to be used. Our teachers are involved with all important decision making, including those 
around assessment Our school governance has several important components: We have a Coordinating Council with 
representatives from each grade (we call them Clusters) team. This team meets weekly with both school 
administrators, goes back to their teams for input and then we make final decisions. The creation of assessments 
happens in Discipline teams, where teachers bring interim assessments and final assessments to colleagues for 
feedback Throughout the year the INPS, consortium and the Superintendent’s office will provide professional 
development in the process of looking at student work and revising teacher instruction and assessment to guide 
teachers through the inquiry process.

for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program.

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 09X403, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Bronx International HS will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  
 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46 

 

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA /State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

  

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.

At Bronx International High School we recognize that new to English students advance in content, skills 
and English language development more rapidly when they are in an environment in which they can 
interact with students possessing a diversity of English language and skill levels.  To target our highest 
needs students, we have 10 supplemental Title III classes serving 150 (including 6 SIFE) ELLs at the 
Entering and Emerging levels, 5 classes on Saturdays and 5 meeting after school on Wednesdays and 
Thursdays.  Within each class, teachers will use a strategy of flexible groupings in which students 
understand and expect that groupings will change frequently based on the learning objectives of the 
lesson.  Teachers take into account students' native language, English language proficiency, literacy 
levels, student interests, content skills and knowledge interests when developing and organizing these 
groups.  
In accordance with INPS (International Network for Public Schools) principles, classes and curricula are 
designed to enable students to engage in English language development through in-depth study of 
content.  Our Title III classes reflect our regular academic program in their approach to student 
engagement and learning by employing a student-centered approach through project-based learning in a 
collaborative setting.  Our Title III supplemental classes offer students extended time to apply new 
learning, engage in further academic discourse and partake in experiences that extend and enhance 
learning with the aim to accelerate English language acquisition and development. The language of 
instruction for all the Title III supplemental classes is English, following the same model as regular 
classes. 
The understanding that students may need extended time to gain and demonstrate mastery of specific 
skills and content is integrated into our approach to teaching, learning and assessment.  We recognize 
that students entering our school are coming from a variety of educational systems and experiences that 
have not prepared them in the same ways.  We have identified 150 students who would benefit from 
additional learning opportunities and the additional time offered in our Title III supplemental classes. 
Our Title III supplemental classes are vital for providing these extended learning opportunities to our 
highest needs English Language Learners.  Teachers of the Title III supplemental classes coordinate 
closely with their team members and guidance counselor to analyze student data around outcomes 
mastery, English level and reading level to identify and recommend candidates for our Title III 
supplemental classes.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Subgroups and grade levels: ELLs in the 11th and 12th grades who score at the beginning and 
intermediate level on the NYSESLAT read below a 7th grade level and are identified by their teachers 
as having trouble accessing social studies content. 
Rationale: In the content area of social studies ELLs struggle with specific content related academic 
vocabulary and concepts. Debating and public speaking and the research and preparation that goes into 
these activities open up multiple avenues to introduce and use this vocabulary and content specific 
concepts, enabling them to gain understanding within the context of projects connected to and 
supporting their Government, Economics or U.S. History classes. Instruction will focus on developing 
skills in oral and written English as well as creating arguments supported by evidence. Academic 
vocabulary acquisition in the content area of social studies and strategies for accessing dense text will be 
heavily emphasized as students work in small groups within the class, researching, writing and 
practicing for debates and oral presentations.  
This class is co-taught by a licensed ESL teacher and a licensed social studies teacher. All instruction is 
in English. 
Materials: 5 iPads, which provide technological support for our highest need students (text-to-voice 
technology reads pages aloud to students who cannot read); language and literacy development through 
reading, news, and literacy apps; vocabulary development (interactive dictionaries, visual dictionaries 
and native language support), especially helpful for low incidence languages and non-written languages; 
apps to create websites, video, photo stories (i.e. Weebly app, imovie, voice record pro); easy uploading 
capacity to school's google drive and haiku system (photos and videos);Voice Record, to record 
interviews and practice presentations and debates. We use this technology to support ELLs with 
language and literacy development. These resources are especially invaluable for our highest need 
students--SIFE, pre-K-3 readers, and low incidence languages (Arabic, Bengali). 
Access Newcomers, Building Literacy through Learning series from Great Source for ELLs, including 
the workbooks Access American History.  
•2) ESL and Living Environment: Science in Action to Support Literacy and Content Mastery for ELLs 
Subgroups and grade levels: ELLs in the 9th and 10th grade who have been in this country 18 months or 
less, are at the beginning level on the NYSESLAT and are identified by their teachers as struggling to 
access science specific academic language, content and concepts.  
Rationale: Students engage in hands-on science projects and experiments to support literacy in the area 
of science and mastery of the learning and performance objectives in the living environment classes. 
Lack of exposure to science specific academic vocabulary and concepts is prevalent among our newest 
arrivals who are targeted for this class. Attention is focused on the language of science to familiarize 
students with the particular way questions are posed and answered in science. Through hands-on science 
exploration students will develop literacy skills in English and science utilizing oral practice, keeping 
journals of observations and writing lab reports. 
Materials: Experiment kits  
This class is co-taught by a licensed ESL teacher and a licensed biology teacher. All instruction is in 
English. 
•3) ESL and Geometry: Asynchronous Learning to Support Literacy and Content Mastery for ELLs 
Subgroups and grade levels: ELLs in the 10th grade who are at the Entering or Emerging level on the 
NYSESLAT and are identified by their teachers as struggling to access math specific academic language 
and concepts.  
Rationale: Students engage in hands-on geometry activities and online adaptive instructional technology 
to support both literacy and mastery of the concepts in geometry. Students learn the materials at their 
own pace and may only move to another module or unit of study once they master the pre-requisite 
knowledge and skills. The online component aims for students to develop basic skills, with emphasis on 
academic language, through daily individualized online instruction, thereby enabling the teacher to focus

Subgroups and grade levels: ELLs in the 11th grade who are at the Entering or Emerging level on the 
NYSESLAT and are identified by their teachers as struggling to access math specific academic language 
and concepts.  
Rationale: A web-based curriculum that adopts a Sheltered Instruction pedagogy and that embeds 
academic language support throughout the lessons will be used to support the students identified for this 
class. The curriculum is designed intentionally and specifically to raise academic achievement and to 
make learning engaging for English language learners, and students struggling to learn algebra.

literacy in their native languages and students identified by their teachers as lacking basic numeracy or 
reading at or below 2nd grade level. 
Rationale: Students who have grown up with little or no education experience have much more to learn 
than just the mathematics in order to be fully functional at school. First and foremost, they must learn 
the English Language: how to read, write and speak. Thus, the need for a numeracy and literacy support 
program that provides intensive small-group instruction using hands-on activities and adaptive 
instructional platform.

The Title III program will provide ELL families with the opportunity to attend a variety of 
workshops so they can better assist in and understand their children's education and learning. 
Teacher facilitators and translators will be paid per session rate and instructional materials will 
be purchased to support activities. 
Workshops- A series of workshops will be held on different topics of interest to our ELL 
families. The workshops are organized and coordinated by the Parent Coordinator, Janet Dweh, 
and will be facilitated by teachers (ESL) and the guidance staff (Social Workers, Guidance 
Counselor, College Advisor and Work Based learning coordinator. All parents and guardians of 
ELLs will be targeted for these workshops. The workshops are conducted in English with staff 
and students providing translation in Spanish, French, Arabic, Bengali and various West African 
languages as needed 
Translation Services: Parents are notified of all meetings, workshops and school events in several 
ways, including backpacked and mailed letters, school messenger and the school website.  All 
communications, including school messenger phone calls are translated into French, Spanish, 
Arabic or Bengali. Staff is available at all meetings and workshops to translate French, Spanish, 
Arabic, Mandingo, Bambara and Mandinki. We also have a team of paid student translators for 
languages our staff does not speak and provide translation services from the DOE Translation 
Unit where necessary. Besides letters and school messenger calls, the parent coordinator, along 
with our Spanish speaking office staff attempt to call all families directly for notification of 
important events, workshops and meetings. 
In addition to the workshops, the PA meets monthly and above translation services are available 
for all parents who do not speak English. Translation is also available at Parent Teacher 
Conferences, held in September, November, February, April and May

Arrivals: This workshop is given as part of Curriculum Night and is specifically designed for 
parents and guardians of our most recent arrivals--those who have been in this country for under 
6 months. This group will include the families of most of our incoming 9th grade (about 100) 
ELLs and approximately 35 ELLs placed in 10th or 11th grade. Numbers are approximate 
because we have a high volume of new admits throughout September and October. For this 
workshop, parents are divided by language group, each group is provided translation by staff 
and/or student translators. The workshop is designed to explain and familiarize families with 
necessary vocabulary they need to understand and take an active role in their children’s 
education. We will discuss and answer questions on the differences in curricula and the 
educational systems here as compared to their countries of origin and how English as a new 
language is taught at Bronx International, including the INPS principles of English language 
learning. Facilitators and translators not required to attend Curriculum Night will be paid per 
session. 
2. December 13th, 2017 5:30 to 7:00 College Night for Families of 11th and 12th Grade ELLs. 
This workshop is designed to introduce and familiarize non English speaking parents and 
guardians with the language of the college application process and the steps necessary to begin 
this process. The workshop will be conducted in Spanish by the College Advisor and, in a 
separate room in English, with translation to French, Arabic and Bengali as needed. The 
guidance staff and teacher translators will be paid per session. 
3. January 17, 2018 5:00-7:00 Navigating Financial Aid for ELL Families (12th Grade):  This 
workshop is specifically for ELL families to explain and give one-to-one help with financial aid 
forms, applications, loans, grants and scholarships. Volunteers from the NYU College Advising 
Corps, along with our teachers and staff who speak French, Spanish, Arabic and various Western 
African languages work in the computer lab to begin FAFSA applications and go over necessary 
documentation needed to complete this process. The workshop also includes information on 
scholarships available to undocumented students and resources on financing college without 
government financial aid. Teachers and guidance staff are paid per session. Materials are 
provided in English and Spanish at no cost by the US Department of Education. 
4. March 21, 2018 6:00-7:30 The English Language Learner's Progress toward Graduation: This 
workshop informs families of the extra help opportunities, enrichment activities and extra-
curriculars available to support our ELLs and accelerate English acquisition. The focus will be 
on how parents, guardians and other family members, like older siblings, can help their Beginner 
and Intermediate students pass the English Regents and progress in their classes toward

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The assessment tool  we use to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLS is EdPerformance for 10th, 11th and 12  th   graders, 
which we administer twice a year to measure baseline and progress. All 9th Graders and any new students are given the LENS 
assessment. Students who score above grade 5 will be assessed in Ed. Performance at end of year.  Students who score on or 
below grade 3 will be considered for Bridges class and be administered the LENS assessment along with teacher-created 
assessments to establish grade level in reading comprehension, writing,  speaking and literacy skills. Results offer a breakdown 
of strengths and weaknesses and are shared with content area teachers across each instructional team (4 content area 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62 

 

teachers and 1 academic interventions/ESL specialist responsible for 75-100 students).  With this information we are able to 
tailor interventions toward areas of need and provide extra help geared toward the particular needs of each student. The 
information we gather from these initial assessments, as well as the ongoing ones, inform our instructional plan, the design of 
curriculum, interventions and helps us ensure that we are addressing the specific needs of all students.Our teachers work to 
develop reading and writing skills through all content areas.  Through this consistent reinforcement of reading and writing in 
their classes as well as in our after school and Saturday programming, students see improvement, in their scores over time. 
      
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The testing coordinator, ELL coordinator, 2 school adds, and the Genesis team of 5 teachers have structures in place for 
immediate assessment and evaluation for placement of all incoming students 9-11. This is on-going throughout the fall and 
usually surges again in early spring when we often get a second wave of new arrivals. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our program is measured through the analysis of a wide array of data sources, including: 
•     Graduation rate 
•     Course pass rate 
•     Regents pass rate 
•     Attendance rate 
•     Learning Environment Survey-student results 
•     Learning Environment Survey -parent results 
•     Learning Environment Survey-teacher results 
•     Drop out rate 
•     College class passing rate 
•    PBAT passing rate 
  
Bronx International High School is part of the New York Performance Standards Consortium which is a network of schools who 
have been granted a variance which allows for portfolio-based assessment in lieu of the New York State Regents Exams.  We 
only administer the ELA Regents exam, and therefore have only included our ELA Regents scores in this document. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Our Interventions Team, consisting of 2 ENL teachers, 3 guidance/social workers, the testing coordinator and a special 
education teacher meet weekly to address needs. The team works directly with 25 content area and ENL teachers  who each 
teach 1 period a week to provide academic interventions and/or direct reading instruction in small group settings (6 to 12 
students). 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The following is based on results of 2017 NYSESLAT and NYSITELL: 
 
The NYSITELL data indicates that 75% of our incoming 9th and 10th grade ENLs have tested as Entering (EN), 19% have tested 
as Emerging (EM) and 6% have tested as Transitioning (TR) level.  The data patterns reveal that as students move through the 
grades their literacy levels improve and most students move up to the Emerging and Transitioning level and many move to 
Expanding and Commanding levels to test out. The NYSESLAT test 2017 showed that only 7% of the entire school population 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63 

 

 

tested as Entering (EN) level, 26% of the ENL students tested as Emerging (EM) and 8% tested as Advanced or tested out.  In 
11th grade 27% tested as Beginner, 47% tested  as Intermediate and 30% tested as transitioning (TR) level. The percentage of 
the students who tested at Expanding and Commanding levels is 20%.  Finally, by Senior year only one student tested as EN, 4 
as EM and 20% tested as Transitioning; 54% of the ENL seniors tested as Expanding or Commanding.  It seems clear that over 
the course of their 4 years most of our students improve in their literacy skills.  
An analysis of our NYSITELL and NYSESLAT results for the school reveals several things: 
 
a)  Our population is incredibly heterogeneous in terms of language ability. 
b)  Most students classified as beginners and intermediates are situated in the lower grades (9 and 10) while most students 
deemed advanced and proficient are in the higher grades (11 and 12). 
c)  The vast majority of students show improvement in at least two of the NYSESLAT language modalities. 
d) Our NYSITELL data indicates that although most of our new arrivals test as Beginners and nearly all score very low in 
listening, reading, and writing, after this, the most crucial pattern we see is one of improvement. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The Guidance Team, which includes 2 social workers, 1 guidance counselor, and two APs (one is the ELL Coordinator) meet 
weekly. In turn, each  teacher team (5 teacher teams, each with 75-100 students) meets weekly with their guidance person 
(social worker of counselor). There is a consistent back-and-forth between teams so information can be disseminated and 
action taken to make adjustments to the program as needs arise through new findings. These two teams also cross-pollinate 
with the Interventions Team. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

a. Instruction at our school is delivered collaboratively by teams of six teachers who work to plan instruction for 
groups of approximately 75 to 100 students.   
b. Our school uses all of these program models, although in alignment with the INPS model, heterogenous groupings 
predominate.  Each group of students is block programmed and those students travel together throughout the 
day.  Within their blocks, 9th and 10th grade students are mixed, while 11th and 12th grade students form separate 
teams of about 100 students.  The blocks are heterogeneous but occasionally teachers may choose to group students 
within the block homogeneously if that suits the students’ and block’s needs for a specific task or project. 
c.  Integrated and Standalone ENL are implemented:  Beginning/Entering students will receive a minimum of 540 
minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of ENL standalone, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and 180 
minutes of standalone or integrated ENL (with ELA or any other content area).  Low Intermediates/Emerging will 
receive 360 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 90 minutes of standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated 
ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area. 
Intermediate/Transitioning will receive 180 ENL minutes per week which consists of 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA 
or other content area and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area). 
Advanced/Expanding will receive 180 minutes of ENL per week which consists of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA 
or other content area.  Proficient/Commanding or students who are former ELL's will receive 90 minutes of ENL each 
week which consists of 90 integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

As per the new CR Part 154 requirements, beginning September 2017, students will be carefully programmed to receive the 
mandated ENL and ELA instructional minutes based on new proficiency guidelines.  Beginners/Entering students will receive a 
minimum of 540 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of ENL standalone, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA 
and 180 minutes of standalone or intergrated ENL with ELA or any other content area).  Low Intermediates/Emerging will 
receive 360 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 90 minutes of standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA  and 
90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area.)  Intermediate/Transitioning willl receive 180 
ENL minutes per week (this consists of 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area and 90 minutes of standalone 
or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area). Advanced/Expanding will receive 180 minutes of ENL per week (this 
consists of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.)  Proficient/Commanding or students who are former 
ELL's will receive 90 minutes of ENL each week (this consists of 90 integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.)  
We have a series of delivery models to ensure that each student receives these mandated ESL and ELA minutes through 
discrete ESL classes as well as many classes taught by dual certified ESL/content area teachers. (ie: teachers who have dual 
certification in both ESL and a content area such as ESL/English, ESL/Social Studies and ESL/Biology certification.) Each 
instructional team includes at least one teacher who is licensed in ESL; in addition, all of our content area teachers are trained 
in language development and ESL methodologies and encouraged to pursue ESL certification.  The school schedule and teacher 
programming ensure that all entitled ESL students receive the mandated number of minutes required according to CR Part 
154.  In addition to our regular content curriculum all ELL students are given extra ESL instruction in order to meet the number 
of minutes they require of ESL instruction each week. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
At Bronx International High School our ENL teachers as well as all of our content area teachers provide content area support 
for ELLs through all content area classes. All students take math, science, social studies, and ENL and English every 
year.  Although all classes are taught in English, the language of instruction for specific projects and on any specific day is 
collaboratively determined – students use both English and their native languages to explore content and the locus of control 
for language is student-driven by the content and the students’ needs.  Instruction is not unidirectional from teacher to 
student in our school.  Students work in groups to complete collaborative tasks that both develop language and content 
knowledge. 
 
The instructional method used in delivering content area instruction is through the Internationals Network for Public Schools 
(INPS) Approach.  This research-based instructional approach utilizes five strategies which foster language development and 
meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.  They consist of heterogeneity and collaboration, experiential and 
project-based learning, language and content integration, localized autonomy and responsibility and one learning model for 
all.  A variety of instructional materials are used, such as: laptops, books, work books, dictionaries and teacher-generated 
activities.  Increasingly we are using digital resources since we became an Apple ConnectEd school and have a 1 to 1 iPad to 
student ratio. The educational principles of Bronx Internationals HS include an approach to curriculum that is student-
centered, inquiry-driven, and project-based, revolving around themes and essential questions that provide a balance between 
content and English language skill building.  Small, heterogeneous grouping within classes provide a powerful vehicle for 
English acquisition, wherein students from diverse language backgrounds use English to accomplish a given task, drawing on 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65 

 

their native language as a resource.  Language and literacy are developed through interaction with peers and teachers about 
meaningful ideas in authentic context.   
 
In order to provide our students with native language support in the content area we provide our students with bilingual 
dictionaries, peer group support, native language texts, as well as bilingual paraprofessionals to assist in the classroom. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

At Bronx International High School, ELLs are evaluated using the instructional strategies as described in Question # 6 (a-e) 
below.  At orientation, incoming ELLs are given a native language assessment.  Testing and native-language writing 
assessments are on-going throughout the year as new students arrive.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

           All students who are identified as SIFE (Students with Interrupted/Inconsistent Formal Education) are immediately 
placed in our SIFE program where they receive additional support in English literacy until a level of proficiency is achieved as 
determined by the SIFE coordinator and the SIFE leadership team along with the student’s teachers and guidance 
counselors.  The common denominator among these students is an inability to read or write in their native language.  Teachers 
and guidance counselors identify students who meet this profile through an examination of report cards, progress 
reports,  educational history and student work, student parent interviews and teacher referrals.  Once students are identified 
as SIFE the parents or guardians are informed and sign-off on an agreement that the student will complete a bridge year 
(Bridges) before entering 9th grade. After this year they are fully integrated into the regular program.   
            The Bridges teacher team includes a paraprofessional and students are provided with the same academic interventions 
and small group instruction as the rest of the school.  Two teachers participate in the after-school tutoring and Saturday 
Academy.  This year we have added an additional language arts period, school-wide, which is co-taught for Bridges by a ENL 
teacher and reading specialist. Over the past four years with the funds from the SIFE grant literacy program an accelerated 
literacy program was implemented school-wide and met with enthusiasm by staff, students and families. 
            Our SIFE model has three important features: 
•     An intensive Language Arts period is held during the regular core daily program to accelerate learning taught by a specially 
trained literacy ESL licensed teacher in small group settings of five to ten students in which instruction is guided by individual 
students’ needs.  This class is focused on reading comprehension, reading fluency and vocabulary development based on high 
interest topics drawn from the social studies curriculum with the support of the CUNY Graduate Center Bridges Program. 
•     Scaffolding students’ work in regular heterogeneous classes for most of the school day by developing collaboration 
between the SIFE teacher and content area teachers to generalize and practice newly learned skills and strategies across a 
variety of settings.  SIFE students receive 8 55 minute ELA/ENL periods weekly with certified ESL teachers. 4 of these periods 
weekly are co-taught with a reading specialist. 
•     All SIFE students are expected to attend extra after school home work sessions and are also enrolled in our weekly 
Saturday Academy, which serves to enhance their literacy skills through enrichment and academic support. 
•     Our SIFE Leadership team has completed a SIFE toolkit which will be shared with other SIFE schools throughout the city.   
•     Our SIFE Leadership team has also hosted a series of Open Houses over the past four years for SIFE Teachers from 
throughout the city in order to share best practices among educators of SIFE as well as all ELL students. 
  
b)     Instructional Plan for Newcomer ELL Students: 
              Newcomers to the school, along with their parents, meet initially with a guidance counselor who assesses their needs 
and academic development during intake.  All new students and their parents receive an orientation developed by the 
guidance staff along with the parent coordinator.  All students new to the United States and to NYC are given the NYSITELL

exam which assesses each student's English language abilities.  For students transferring in from NYC schools, test results are 
reviewed and students are then matched with teams of teachers who it is felt would best meet the needs of the specific 
student.  Students are placed in appropriate classes according to their specific needs.  The teachers meet in teams to discuss 
the specific needs of all new students.  A plan is formulated to best meet the needs of each particular student. 
  
c)     Instructional Plan for Developing ELLs: 
             The plan for developing ELLs receiving  services for 4-6 years consists of ongoing support and mentoring. ELLs with 4-6 
years of services are placed in appropriate classes to best meet their needs and continue their English language 
development.  Their teachers meet regularly in teams to discuss the needs fo the specific students.  A plan is formulated and 
updated regularly to meet the needs of each student.  ELLs who are receiving service for 4-6 years receive a full program and 
receive all the same support structures as the rest of our ELL poplulations.  Struggling ELLs who are receiving 4-6 years of 
service are encouraged and often mandated to avail themselves of all the extra support opportunities provided to all the 
students at large.  This help takes the form of one-on-one mentoring, small group instruction, after school homework help, the 
Saturday literacy program as well as a variety of other activities.  ELLs with 4-6 years of service are encouraged to try to take 
some college classes to help them to begin the transition towards college life.  These ELLs with 4-6 years who meet regularly 
with their guidance counselor and teachers on their team to receive support and feedback to help assess in their language 
development. 
  
d)     Instructional Plan for Long Term ELLs: 
             The plan for long term ELLs consists of ongoing support and mentoring.  Long term ELLs continue with a full program 
whether they are with us 5 or 6 years and retain all of the same support structures in place for the entire student 
population.  Struggling long term ELLs are encouraged to take advantage of all extra help opportunities provided to the 
students at large.   This extra help takes the form of one-on-one mentoring, small group instruction, after school homework 
help, writing center as well as a variety of other activities.  Whenever possible, long-term ELLs are encouraged to begin taking 
college classes to help them to begin the transition towards college life.  International High School long term ELLs regularly 
begin taking remedial college classes.  All long term ELLs in college classes receive support from a high school teacher mentor. 
  
e)     Instructional Plan for Former ELLs up to 2 years after exiting ELL status): 
             As students reach proficiency and test out through the NYSESLAT assessment, they continue to receive a full program 
of ESL services to support and provide for their continued academic growth and development of English proficiency.   Students 
receive higher levels of project opportunities and also have the opportunity to take college classes in any of their academic 
areas.  Our school offers these students the opportunity to take College Now classes through CUNY at Hostos and Bronx 
Community College.  Students who are determined to have reached proficiency continue to receive support from their 
teachers as needed.  Former ELLs continue to receive the mandated testing accomodations after they they have testied out on 
the NYSESLAT exam. All former ELLs in college classes receive support from a high school teacher mentor. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
                Instructional strategies and grade level materials used to provide ELL-SWDs access to academic areas and accelerate 
English language development: 
                   The Special Education Coordinator, an Assistant Principal and the Special Education teacher review all IEPs for ELL-
SWDs to ensure that all IEP mandates are being met and to ensure that the ELL-SWD student receives the appropriate program 
in the least restrictive environment.  After reviewing the mandates of the IEP, the full team of teachers meet with the Special 
Education teacher to discuss specific instructional strategies that would prove valuable to the growth of the ELL-SWD student 
and follow the mandates of the IEP.  The team along with the guidance counselor, Assistant Principal and Special Education 
teacher ensure that all of the mandates in the IEP are carried out. If additional support is needed the student is provided with 
additional support services as per the IEP.   
            The ELL-SWD students who may have learning needs undiagnosed in their home country, have been here a short time 
and are only beginning to learn English, and/or have experienced serious disruptions and inadequacies in their earlier 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67 

 

academic preparation are addressed by creating instructional opportunities geared to their needs. Students with Individualized 
Education Plans (IEP's) receive full support from the instructional teams to which they belong. Those students are included in 
mainstream classes, and receive additional services in language, counseling, and adaptive physical education. In biweekly 
meetings, the teachers of our instructional teams meet to review the progress of these and other students. Teams of teachers 
along with the guidance counselors meet regularly throughout the semester to review the progress of each student in 
accordance with their specific IEP. 
             Some of the specific instructional strategies for ELLs depending on the requirements of their specific IEPs include: 
Teachers, guidance counselors and special education teacher meet regularly to discuss the individual needs of the ELL-SWD 
student.  Once students have been identified as ELL-SWD and a program has been established following the mandates of their 
IEP, the challenge is to find ways to teach the student the skills they require while also teaching the student to read, write and 
speak English and acquire content knowledge when they may have limited, if any academic skills, have specific disabilities as 
described in their IEP and may have serious affective issues as well.  In order to service the ELL-SWD student in the least 
restrictive environment, students are mainstreamed into the regular academic class and each team provides extra services: 
including one-on-one work with a paraprofessional, small group instruction and after school tutoring.  School-wide, a Saturday 
enrichment program has been established, and changes in student programs are made to allow the student time to meet with 
the necessary special service provider depending on the students specific needs.   
             Other strategies include scaffolding students’ work in the regular heterogeneous classes for most of the school day by 
developing collaboration between the special education teacher or service provider and the content area teachers.  A team 
teaching approach would be used in which the special education teacher plans with the content area teachers to map out 
strategies an best practices and to access the students strengths and area which still need improvement. 
            If necessary, ELL-SWD students are expected to attend extra after school home work sessions and are also enrolled in 
our weekly Saturday Academy Literacy Program which serves to enhance their literacy skills through enrichment and academic 
support.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
             Bronx International HS  uses a variety of curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of 
ELL-SWDs to attain their IEP goals within the least restrictive environment.  Once students are identified ELL-SWDs our 
challenge is to find ways to teach students according to the mandates of their IEPs in the least restrictive setting.  The team 
meets with our Special Education teacher or service provider depending on the needs of that students particular IEP in order 
to determine the best instructional strategies to meet the needs to that student according to their IEP.  In order to service 
students who are struggling, each team has provided extra services:  including one-on-one work with a paraprofessional, small 
group instruction, and after school tutoring.  School-wide, a Saturday enrichment program has been established, and changes 
in student programs (such as an extra language arts period) have been made.  By adapting curricula to enable those students 
to succeed, by expanding the time available to team members to work with them individually, and by using the resources of 
paraprofessionals and student teachers and Teachers College field workers, they are supported in meeting the graduation 
certification requirements.  Our plan maintains that our future students with IEPs will receive additional academic assistance in 
accordance with the particular needs of their individualized IEPs.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
      All of our targeted intervention program are geared towards supporting all of our ELL subgroups; teachers running these 
programs implement the “Internationals Approach” in all of them. At Bronx International High School we recognize that new 
to English students advance in content, skills and English language development more rapidly when they are in an environment 
in which they can interact with students possessing a diversity of English language and skill levels.  To target our highest needs 
students, we have 10 supplemental Title III classes serving 150 (including 15 SIFE) ELLs at the beginner and intermediate levels, 
5 classes on Saturdays and 5 meeting after school on Wednesdays and Thursdays.  Within each class, teachers will use a 
strategy of flexible groupings in which students understand and expect that groupings will change frequently based on the 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68 

 

learning objectives of the lesson.  Teachers take into account students' native language, English language proficiency, literacy 
levels, student interests, content skills and knowledge interests when developing and organizing these groups.  
     In accordance with INPS (International Network for Public Schools) principles, classes and curricula are designed to enable 
students to engage in English language development through in-depth study of content.  Our Title III classes reflect our regular 
academic program in their approach to student engagement and learning by employing a student-centered approach through 
project-based learning in a collaborative setting.  Our Title III supplemental classes offer students extended time to apply new 
learning, engage in further academic discourse and partake in experiences that extend and enhance learning with the aim to 
accelerate English language acquisition and development. The language of instruction for all the Title III supplemental classes is 
English, following the same model as regular classes. 
   The understanding that students may need extended time to gain and demonstrate mastery of specific skills and content is 
integrated into our approach to teaching, learning and assessment.  We recognize that students entering our school are 
coming from a variety of educational systems and experiences that have not prepared them in the same ways.  We have 
identified 150 students who would benefit from additional learning opportunities and the additional time offered in our Title III 
supplemental classes. Our Title III supplemental classes are vital for providing these extended learning opportunities to our 
highest needs English Language Learners.  Teachers of the Title III supplemental classes coordinate closely with their team 
members and guidance counselor to analyze student data around outcomes mastery, English level and reading level to identify 
and recommend candidates for our Title III supplemental classes. 
  
Saturday Enrichment Academy to Support Literacy and Content Mastery for ELLs-20 sessions 9:00am-1:00pm 
• 1) ESL and Social Studies Enrichment: Debate and Public Speaking 
Subgroups and grade levels: ELLs in the 11th and 12th grades who score at the beginning and intermediate level on the 
NYSESLAT read below a 7th grade level and are identified by their teachers as having trouble accessing social studies content. 
Rationale: In the content area of social studies ELLs struggle with specific content related academic vocabulary and concepts. 
Debating and public speaking and the research and preparation that goes into these activities open up multiple avenues to 
introduce and use this vocabulary and concepts, enabling them to gain understanding within the context of projects connected 
to and supporting their Government, Economics or U.S. History classes. Instruction will focus on developing skills in oral and 
written English as well as creating arguments supported by evidence. Academic vocabulary acquisition in the content area of 
social studies and strategies for accessing dense text will be heavily emphasized as students work in small groups within the 
class, researching, writing and practicing for debates and oral presentations.  
•2) ESL and Living Environment: Science in Action to Support Literacy and Content Mastery for ELLs 
Subgroups and grade levels: ELLs in the 9th and 10th grade who have been in this country 18 months or less, are at the 
beginning level on the NYSESLAT and are identified by their teachers as struggling to access science specific academic 
language, content and concepts.  
Rationale: Students engage in hands-on science projects and experiments to support literacy in the area of science and 
mastery of the learning and performance objectives in the living environment classes. Lack of exposure to science specific 
academic vocabulary and concepts is prevalent among our newest arrivals who are targeted for this class. Attention is focused 
on the language of science to familiarize students with the particular way questions are posed and answered in science. 
Through hands-on science exploration students will develop literacy skills in English and science utilizing oral practice, keeping 
journals of observations and writing lab reports. 
•3) ESL and Geometry: Asynchronous Learning to Support Literacy and Content Mastery for ELLs 
Subgroups and grade levels: ELLs in the 12th grade who are at the beginning or intermediate level on the NYSESLAT and are 
identified by their teachers as struggling to access math specific academic language and concepts.  
Rationale: Students engage in hands-on geometry activities and online adaptive instructional technology to support both 
literacy and mastery of the concepts in geometry. Students learn the materials at their own pace and may only move to 
another module or unit of study once they master the pre-requisite knowledge and skills. The online component aims for 
students to develop basic skills, with emphasis on academic language, through daily individualized online instruction, thereby 
enabling the teacher to focus on critical-thinking, building rich classroom experiences, and providing extra help to other 
students who need one-on-one instruction. 
•4) ESL and Algebra II: Sheltered Instruction to Support Literacy and Content Mastery for ELLs 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69 

 

Subgroups and grade levels: ELLs in the 11th grade who are at the beginning or intermediate level on the NYSESLAT and are 
identified by their teachers as struggling to access math specific academic language and concepts.  
Rationale: A web-based curriculum that adopts a Sheltered Instruction pedagogy and that embeds academic language support 
throughout the lessons will be used to support the students identified for this class. The curriculum is designed intentionally 
and specifically to raise academic achievement and to make learning engaging for English language learners, and students 
struggling to learn algebra.  
•5) Bridges ESL and Math: Numeracy and Literacy Support for ELLs 
Subgroups and grade levels: 9th and 10th grade SIFE, 9th and 10th grade students with little or no literacy in their native 
languages and students identified by their teachers as lacking basic numeracy or reading at or below 2nd grade level. 
Rationale: Students who have grown up with little or no education experience have much more to learn than just the 
mathematics in order to be fully functional at school. First and foremost, they must learn the English Language: how to read, 
write and speak. Thus, the need for a numeracy and literacy support program that provides intensive small-group instruction 
using hands-on activities and adaptive instructional platform.  
************************************************************************************ 
After School Small Group Instruction Support for ELLs 
5 classes will meet twice weekly from 3:28 to 4:28 for a total of 42 sessions beginning November 4, 2015 and ending June 16,

studies specific academic vocabulary or content.  
Rationale: In the content area of social studies ELLs new to the country, reading below 4th Grade level struggle with specific 
content related academic vocabulary and content. Academic vocabulary acquisition in the content area of social studies and 
strategies for accessing dense text will be heavily emphasized as students work in small groups on projects that support 
content mastery and English acquisition.  
  
2. ESL and Living Environment-Targeted Enrichment for ELLs 
Subgroups and grade levels: 9th and 10th graders, here for 18 months or less, at beginning or intermediate level on the 
NYSESLAT and have been identified by their teachers as struggling to access science specific academic vocabulary or content.  
Rationale: In the content area of biology ELLs new to the country and English, struggle with specific content related academic 
vocabulary and science concepts. Academic vocabulary acquisition in the content area of biology and strategies for accessing 
dense text will be heavily emphasized as students work in small groups on projects that support content mastery and English 
acquisition. This class is co-taught by a licensed ESL teacher and a licensed biology teacher. All instruction is in English, 
following the INPS model.

struggling to learn algebra.  This class is co-taught by a licensed bilingual Special Education teacher and a licensed math 
teacher. Instruction is in English and Spanish. 
5) ESL and English: Literature Circles-Targeted Enrichment for ELLs 
Subgroups and grade levels: 11th and 12th grade students, scoring at the beginning or intermediate level on the NYSESLAT, 
who have not passed the ELA Regents and are identified by their teachers as struggling readers. 
Rationale: To advance as readers and writers, ELLs need practice reading independently from leveled books with high interest 
level. The Literature Circle class gives them structured opportunities to read, discuss and write about literature. Academic 
vocabulary and supporting an argument with evidence is emphasized as students discuss and write in the literature circles 
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

This year we have introduced a new course for all students in each grade, Reading and Discourse. This course is taught by 5 
ENL certified teachers, with Donna McKenne, dual certified in English and ENL acting as lead teacher and coach. Our goal is to 
address concerns about our students’ language and literacy growth, as well as moving students from an over-reliance on 
teachers to self-reliance and a sense of self-efficacy. Student-led discourse allows students to see peers as partners in learning 
and combines fluency, metacognitive awareness, translanguaging, and comprehension. We will teach students: 
 
To be aware of and share their ideas, questions, and confusions so all can learn from them 
To learn new methods to understand texts from more experienced peers and teachers 
To make thinking around texts visible with peer and expert modeling 
To advocates for themselves and, by extension, their communities. 
 
Through this course, we want students to enjoy reading and digging into texts through learning how to: choose texts for a 
variety of interests and purposes, be metacognitive and peer/self-monitor while reading, collaboratively unpack meaning from 
words, sentence syntax, and whole texts, and co-construct knowledge through discussions to develop their voice and self-
confidence in English. We will teach students how growing into a mindful reader and having a literate life is a process of self-
discovery. 
 
A significant piece of language instruction in the class will be through the Hochman method. Through this method, we will 
teach students about the ways meaning is communicated through the syntax of English sentences, such as SVO, prepositions, 
appositives, subordinating conjunctions, and logic chains like Because/But/So. This will be a tool for unpacking language both 
as they read complex sentences, and then when they write. 
 
This course is designed as a collaborative inquiry project focused on developing students into stronger readers, discussion 
leaders and to foster ownership of the English language. We will use inquiry questions tied to our work and identify students 
as subjects of our inquiry to measure and improve our approach.

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Since almost 100% of our students are ELLs or former ELLs, all school programs are “equal access.” In addition to the support 
and intervention services listed in the answer to Question 5 of this section, we have the following after-school classes; while 
they may not all be “academic”, all of them are designed to continue students’ language development through activities 
incorporating listening, speaking, reading, and writing of English:  
  
•     Student Government 
•    Music Club 
•     Art Club 
•     Digital Design 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71 

 

•     Dance Club 
                 Bike Club 
                 Soccer, basketball and volley ball teams 
  
  
All ELLs and former ELLs are invited to participate in the activities listed above at the time that they register for classes each 
semester. At registration they meet with their guidance counselor and teachers on their instructional team who describe the 
different activities.  Students make a selection with the assistance of their teachers.  Since 100% of our students are either ELLs 
or former ELLs the representation by ELLs in all of our school programs is substantial. 
  
Funding sources for after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in our school: 
Since our school funds are conceptually consolidated, the funding source for most of our after school targeted interventions 
listed in section 9 above and many of those listed in this section are covered by Title III funding as well as tax levy funding. The 
SIFE literacy and SIFE math classes which are held during the regular school day are currently funded exclusively with tax levy 
funds.  The funding for the enrichment class is also covered by regular tax levy funding since it takes place during the regular 
school day.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
It is the philosophy of the school that classroom teachers are the most knowledgeable as to what instructional supplies will 
benefit the ELL students from all ELL sub-groups in their content area classes.  Teachers work in teams to order classroom 
supplies for the ELL students they have in common.  The teachers in consultation with the colleagues on their team as well as 
in consultation with the schools SIFE teacher and guidance counselors which classroom supplies would be most beneficial to 
the students in all of the schools sub-groups.  Each teacher team selects the instructional material they feel will work best for 
the needs of their individual students.  This helps to best meet the needs of all of our students in the individual sub-groups 
within our school, Newcomers, SIFE, ELLs 4-6 years, long term ELLs as well as former ELLs.  Each team shares equally in the 
school’s NYSTL funds and chooses for itself how they wish to spend the schools their allotment of funds to best serve their 
individual students in all of their content area classes.  Teachers and students in all ELL-subgroups have access to a huge array 
of novels, textbooks, non-fiction, bilingual dictionaries as well as native language books.  All of the materials are available to all 
ELL sub-groups. 
Teachers are encouraged to attend ENL conferences to share information regarding various texts as well as other teaching aids 
and in addition our teachers work collaboratively to create their own instructional materials.   Teachers utilize computer 
software, maps, the Internet as well as various other forms of technology which helps to maximize instruction in all content 
areas and within all sub-groups.  Teachers in all content area have access to class sets of laptop computers with Internet access 
as well as two fully equipped computer labs.  Teachers are having students use power point projectors to share the results of 
group projects or individual research.  Smart carts with laptops are bringing technology into the classroom and extending the 
number of computers available to students outside the computer labs.  Various non-profit Internet organizations that provide 
feedback for students are helping students to revise and edit their work as well as suggesting additional resources.   
    The Teaching and Learning Committee has amassed a compendium of book lists, articles on literacy, and reading programs 
for reference by the instructional teams.   
    All students including ELL students in all sub-groups, have access to a variety of technologies including a technology lab, 
wireless laptop computers.  Students use various web based programs. Other resources available to all students and ELL sub-
groups include native language texts and all students including all ELL sub-groups have access to our rather extensive native 
literature collection. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

    All our students participate in our language development/ENL program.  All of our classes use the native language to support 
learning.  As described above, the locus of control over language use resides with our students and they use both English and 
their native languages to discover and develop content.  Some projects every year are done in the native languages and in

English and students are supported in developing their native languages to the greatest extent possible.  Students are 
supported by peers, community partners, family members and/or school personnel.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

    Our instructional teams meet regularly to ensure that required services and supports correspond to ELLs' age and grade 
levels.  All of the required services for high school-aged ELLs are available to students. We use a wide array of resources in our 
school including teacher-made materials, text books on a range of levels, trade books at many reading levels, and a large 
variety of non-text hands on materials.  In addition, our school has wireless access in all classrooms and students use the 
Internet to access resources.  If a teacher or instructional team is having problems locating published materials that are 
appropriate to the age of the ELLs then the instructional teams work together to create an adapt material which will be 
appropriate to the age level of the ELL.  Our teachers understand the importance of utilizing materials and resources for the 
ELL’s appropriate age level in order to keep them engaged in learning.  In addition, instructional teams are encouraged to 
attend professional development workshops throughout the year in order to help them better meet the needs of ELLs with age 
and grade level appropriate to the content of the classes.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
It is the philosophy of the school that classroom teachers are the most knowledgeable as to what instructional supplies will 
benefit the ELL students from all ELL sub-groups in their content area classes.  Teachers work in teams to order classroom 
supplies for the ELL students they have in common.  The teachers in consultation with the colleagues on their team as well as 
in consultation with the schools SIFE teacher and guidance counselors which classroom supplies would be most beneficial to 
the students in all of the schools sub-groups.  Each teacher team selects the instructional material they feel will work best for 
the needs of their individual students.  This helps to best meet the needs of all of our students in the individual sub-groups 
within our school, Newcomers, SIFE, ELL’s 4-6 years, long term ELLs as well as former ELLs.  Each team shares equally in the 
school’s NYSTL funds and chooses for itself how they wish to spend the schools their allotment of funds to best serve their 
individual students in all of their content area classes.  Teachers and students in all ELL-subgroups have access to a huge array 
of novels, textbooks, non-fiction, bilingual dictionaries as well as native language books.  All of the materials are available to all 
ELL sub-groups. 
Teachers are encouraged to attend ENL conferences to share information regarding various texts as well as other teaching aids 
and in addition our teachers work collaboratively to create their own instructional materials.   Teachers utilize computer 
software, maps, the Internet as well as various other forms of technology which helps to maximize instruction in all content 
areas and within all sub-groups.  Teachers in all content area have access to class sets of laptop computers with Internet access 
as well as two fully equipped computer labs.  Teachers are having students use power point projectors to share the results of 
group projects or individual research.  Smart carts with laptops are bringing technology into the classroom and extending the 
number of computers available to students outside the computer labs.  Various nonprofit Internet organizations that provide 
feedback for students are helping students to revise and edit their work as well as suggesting additional resources.   
    The Teaching and Learning Committee has amassed a compendium of booklists, articles on literacy, and reading programs 
for reference by the instructional teams.   
    All students including ELL students in all sub-groups, have access to a variety of technologies including a technology lab, 
wireless laptop computers.  Students use various web based programs. Other resources available to all students and ELL sub-
groups include native language texts and all students including all ELL sub-groups have access to our rather extensive native 
literature collection. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
    Prior to the start of the school year, new students are assigned to heterogeneous teams with, as far as practicable, students 
who speak their native language.  The new students are then paired with more experienced students who are responsible for 
escorting them to class and lunch, making sure they know how to get home, explaining school rules and customs, and acting as 
their translator and advocate in class.  A new family orientation meeting is held annually in June to welcome new students to

our school and to inform them about our school structure and activities and is repeated ant the end of August. 
   During this time a meeting is held with the parents of incoming ELLs to provide them with an understanding of the resources 
available to them at the school as well as within the community. 
    Many similar activities take place when ELL students enroll throughout the school year.  When a new student enrolls they 
meet with their guidance counselor and, along with the assistance of a translator, receive a one-on-one orientation to the 
school and the community.  Just as with the students who began in September, students who enroll throughout the year are 
paired with more experienced students who are responsible for escorting them to class and lunch, making sure they know how 
to get home, explaining school rules and customs, and acting as their translator and advocate in class. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Currently we offer Advanced French and AP French, Advanced Spanish and AP Spanish and have an Arabic class in 
development. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 Professional Development Plan: 
To achieve our instructional goals and implement our core beliefs an extensive structure of professional development has been 
developed.  This professional development structure is on-going and fully integrated into our school structure.   
The principal repository of professional development has been the instructional teams in the school.  Our entire school is 
divided into five team learning communities.  The three Junior Institute 9th and 10th grade teams are each comprised of five 
teachers and approximately 75 students on each team.  The two Senior Institute teams of 11th and 12th graders are comprised 
of 7-8 teachers each with about 100 on each of these two teams. The teachers meet twice weekly to plan, develop and 
implement their curriculum and instruction.  Teams typically interview and hire their team members, and meet at the 
beginning of the year to help each other develop goals.  They develop and revise curriculum and model collaborative work for 
their students.  Teachers also meet in cross-team groups to share student work and curriculum.  They are also sharing 
strategies for maintaining project-based curriculum with meeting the demands of the ELA Regents exams and the PBATs. 
  
Our SIFE Leadership team meets regularly to discuss curriculum issues and students’ progress within the program.  In addition, 
members of the SIFE Leadership team have run workshops to share techniques on meeting the variety of literacy challenges 
faced by teachers of ELLs.  We continue to work closely with academic experts exploring several approaches in order to 
develop a toolbox of strategies that all of our teachers can use with students and share throughout content areas. 
 
All of our content area teachers, ESL teachers and intervention specialists will participate in 20 full day trainings over a two 
year period with Megan Mehr, Instructional Specialist with the Internationals Network. 
 
In addition we will continue our work with  Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) coaches in a series of PDs--

"Adapting the Teachers College Reading and Writing Workshop to English Language Learners." These all day sessions will begin 
in the spring: 
 
Session 1-Reading Workshop/Independent Reading in the ELL Classroom:  Creating and sustaining independent reading and 
the instruction that goes alongside it can greatly impact ELL students.  We will discuss bottom lines for getting this work in 
place and particular strategies and structures for supporting ELL students. Participants: 9 ESL teachers, 1 bilingual Sp Ed and 1 
social studies. 
Session 2-Nonfiction Reading Across Content Areas:  So much of learning involves reading, especially nonfiction reading.  In 
order for ELLs to have access to content of any kind, becoming proficient in nonfiction reading is essential.  This workshop will 
support all content-area teachers in incorporating instruction around nonfiction reading and strategies for accessing dense 
academic text. 
Session 3-Fluency Workshop:  As the acquire vocabulary in English, ELLs need strategic work and practice around fluency in 
reading.  This workshop will offer a variety of approaches for incorporating this kind of instruction and practice into the English 
classroom and as part of academic interventions in small groups. 
Session 4-Using Debate to Support Argument Writing and Oral Academic English: Debate can be one of the most effective ways 
to understand and develop argument writing - a key component of the CCSS.  In addition, it affords ELLS with multiple 
opportunities to practice speaking and presentation skills. Participants: 9 ESL teachers, 1 bilingual Sp Ed, 1 social studies. 
Session 5-Conferring in the Reading Workshop:  Once students are all reading books appropriate to their levels and interests, 
teachers can help students make great strides in their reading through one on one or small group instruction.  This workshop 
will explore methods and content to support this important work, with particular focus on your lowest level readers, beginner 
level ELLS and SIFE students. Participants: 
6. Session 6-Next steps and planning for next year. 
  
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
  
All of our teaching staff, which includes teachers who do not hold ESL or Bilingual licenses, are provided with a series of 
professional opportunities.  The professional development program focuses on providing teachers with various instructional 
strategies for teaching English Language Learners.  It also focuses on how to prepare ELLs to meet and exceed the NYC and NYS 
performance and learning Standards.  These professional development sessions are facilitated by fellow faculty members and 
school administrators.  In addition to the full day workshops described above, professional development opportunities include 
but are not limited to: 
Supporting SIFE and IEP Students to Access a Rigorous Curriculum 
Academic Language for ELL Students 
Introduction on Language Development 
Sharing Curriculum Maps across Teams and Disciplines 
Language and Content Integration for ELLs: 
Native Language Use in the Classroom 
Let’s Give ‘Em Something to Talk About: Language and Content Integration 
  
In addition, our staff participates in the Internationals Network for Public Schools Professional Development workshops at 
three different points throughout the year. Our entire staff will meet with their peers from our sister International High 
Schools and attend workshops designed specifically for educators of recent immigrant ELL students.  Topics will include 
scaffolding instruction, differentiation of instruction, ENL methodologies, SIFE students, meeting the affective needs of 
immigrant children, and language development. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           75 

 

 

Other members of our non-teaching staff also attend staff development training.  Our school secretaries and parent 
coordinator take part in many of the above mentioned staff development activities along with teachers.  The Parent 
Coordinator attends the mandatory two day Respect for all Anti-Harassment Initiative to prevent bullying and bias related 
incidents.  
  
Since all of our staff participates in the above-mentioned professional development opportunities throughout the school year, 
plus many more staff members avail themselves of the professional development opportunities listed in part 2 above, 
everyone receives many more hours than the current 50% mandated total for bi-lingual/ESL teachers. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We hold annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs at least one time during each school year, in addition to the four 
regular parent teacher conferences.  At these meetings teachers discuss the goals of the program, the language development 
process of the individual student, the language proficiency assessment results as well as the student's language development 
needs in all content areas. At this meeting we will have content area teachers, the student counselor, and a school staff 
member to translate as needed.  If no staff member is able to translate than we will utilize the DOE Translation Unit to hold 
over the phone translations. 
Our teachers work collaboratively on five interdisciplinary teams and each team meets twice weekly to discuss students' 
language development and content knowledge progress, language proficiency assessment results and language development 
needs. 
In addition each interdisciplinary team has an after school 50 minute period on Tuesday set aside specifically for parent 
involvement time.  This period of time, which is within the teachers' contractual day is specifically set aside for meetings and 
contacts with parents of ELLs.  Each team is assigned a paraprofessional or Community Associate in order to place phone calls 
to parents to schedule meetings. 
  
2. In order to ensure that parent needs are accommodated we will utilize our faculty members in order to make phone calls to 
parents to arrange individual meetings.  When a faculty member is not available to translate we will utilize the DOE Translation 
Unit to ensure that all parents receive information about their individual parent meeting in their native language.  Our five 
interdisciplinary teams will work with parents schedules to coordinate the best time for the individual parent meetings. 
Upon parents arrival to school, they will sign in on a computer in the am in office with translation help when needed.  Teams 
will document which parents attend their meetings and will make follow up outreach to any parents who have not been able 
to attend a scheduled meeting.Paste response to question here:    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Bronx International provides ELL families with a variety of workshops so they can better assist in and understand their 
children's education and learning. 
Workshops- This year a series of workshops will be held on different topics of interest to our ELL families. The workshops are 
organized and coordinated by the Parent Coordinator, Janet Dweh, and will be facilitated by teachers and the guidance staff. 
All parents and guardians of ELLs will be targeted for these workshops. The workshops are conducted in English with staff and 
students providing translation in Spanish, French, Arabic, Bengali and various West African languages as needed. 
Translation Services: Parents are notified of all meetings, workshops and school events in several ways, including backpacked 
and mailed letters, school messenger and the school website. All communications, including school messenger phone calls are 
translated into French, Spanish, Arabic or Bengali. Staff is available at all meetings and workshops to translate French, Spanish, 
Arabic, Mandingo, Bambara and Mandinki. We also have a team of paid student translators for languages our staff does not 
speak and provide translation services from the DOE Translation Unit where necessary. Besides letters and school messenger 
calls, the parent coordinator, along with our Spanish speaking office staff attempts to call all families directly for notification of

important events, workshops and meetings. 
1) September 28, 2017 5:00-8:00 Curriculum Night Workshop for Families of ELLs-New Arrivals: This workshop is given as part 
of Curriculum Night and is specifically designed for parents and guardians of our most recent arrivals--those who have been in 
this country for under 6 months. This group will include the families of most of our incoming 9th grade (about 100) ELLs and 
approximately 35 ELLs placed in 10th or 11th grade. Numbers are approximate because we have a high volume of new admits 
throughout September and October. For this workshop, parents are divided by language group, each group provided with 
translation  by staff and/or student translators. The workshop is designed to explain and familiarize families with necessary 
vocabulary they need to understand and take an active role in their children’s education. We will discuss and answer questions 
on the differences in curricula and the educational systems here as opposed to their countries of origin and how ESL is taught 
at Bronx International, including the INPS principles of English language learning.  
2. December 7th, 2017 5:30 to 7:00 College Night for Families of 11th and 12th Grade ELLs. This workshop is designed to 
introduce and familiarize non English speaking parents and guardians with the language of the college application process and 
the steps necessary to begin this process. The workshop will be conducted in Spanish by the college advisers and, in a separate 
room in English, with translation to French, Arabic and Bengali as needed. 
3. January 18, 2018 5:00-7:00 Navigating Financial Aid for ELL Families (12th Grade):  This workshop is specifically for ELL 
families to explain and give one-to-one help with financial aid forms, applications, loans, grants and scholarships. Volunteers 
from the NYU College Advising Corps, HESC, along with our teachers and staff who speak French, Spanish, Arabic and various 
Western African languages work in the computer lab to begin FAFSA applications and go over necessary documentation 
needed to complete this process. The workshop also includes information on scholarships available to undocumented students 
and resources on financing college without government financial aid. Materials are provided in English and Spanish at no cost 
by the US Department of Education. 
4. March 22, 2018 6:00-7:30 The English Language Learner's Progress toward Graduation: This workshop informs families of 
the extra help opportunities, enrichment activities and extra curriculars available to support our ELLs and accelerate English 
acquisition. The focus will be on how parents, guardians and other family members, like older siblings, can help their Beginner 
and Intermediate students pass the English Regents and progress in their classes toward graduation and college readiness. This 
workshop will be facilitated by a dual licensed ESL/English teacher  and a science licensed teacher. Translation will be provided 
by teachers, staff and students.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Joaquin Vega, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Based on the Home Language Identification Survey, a record of adult preferred languages for written translation 
and oral interpretation are maintained in ATS: 

Spanish - 82%, 

Bengali – 3.1%, 

French – 10.1%;

Fulani - 0.7%, 

Arabic – 3.1%, 

Italian – 0.2%; 

Other – 0.8%.  

Copies of said information are shared with our Guidance Counselor, Parent Coordinator, Community Coordinator, 
and others. 

All written correspondence between the school and students’ families is provided in the language of their choice, 
which most often is in their native language. As a result, we use the NYCDOE’s internal translation unit to provide 
translations of all school correspondence in Arabic, Bengali, French, Arabic and Spanish including:  

a. Announcing important meeting dates (Open School Night, SLT meetings, Family Association meetings, etc.)  

b. Special events (Thanksgiving Feast, International Festival) 

c. Letters of concern about students’ academic performance and behavior 

d. Letters of congratulations praising student performance and behavior

about school policy, which they receive upon admitting their child to our school . 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language
