Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our mission is: “Excellence in Teaching and Learning.” Our vision reflects our beliefs that - “Every child enrolled in P.S. 
53X will: read, write and perform mathematically on or above grade level at the completion of each school year.”  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 53X remains one of the larger elementary public schools in District Nine, of the New York City Department of 
Education. It currently enrolls approximately 1,050 students in Grades Pre-K through 5. We currently have three full-
day Pre-K classes. 

Several systemic practices have been implemented in our school, driven by our goal to continually enhance our 
instructional program. We have instituted an “A-day and B-day” model that equalizes the teaching of literacy and 
mathematics. In tandem, there is a uniquely designed instructional framework that focuses on teaching and learning. 
Our fifth grade is currently departmentalized, which prepares students for middle school. There are extended weekly 
academic programs to provide students with additional academic support, beyond the regular school hours. The 
extended weekly programs include After-school, Saturday, Morning ENL, and Holiday Academies. At P.S. 53X, we 
currently have a music program partially funded by ‘Music and the Brain.’ Lastly, the student population is 
represented by our Student Council. 

In our effort to support teachers and increase collaboration, there are several initiatives which have been 
implemented. There is a monthly breakfast program for staff. A weekly 90-minutes block of time is allocated for 
grade-alike instructional planning. This is facilitated by a deliberate congruence in daily preparation period schedule 
according to grade designation. Lastly, teachers select professional development activities, on Monday afternoons, 
which are presented by their peers, in cyclical modules. We were the 2014 recipient of the United Federation of 
Teachers (UFT) Partnership Award. We are also the recipients of four large technology grants from the New York City 
Council. In support of our parents, weekly ENL classes are conducted for parents. Our affiliation with community-
based organizations includes: the Boy Scouts of America, City Harvest and Wellness in the School (WITS). In 
collaboration with WITS and City Harvest, we offer cooking classes for both parents and students. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Currently, our special education student population consists of students who receive education in the following 
settings: self-contained classrooms, integrated classrooms with general education population, general education 
classrooms with additional support such as academic intervention. Our special education student population needs 
include: speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, counseling and academic intervention, 
in tandem to their tailored instruction in their respective classrooms. We also have an English as a New Language 
learners (ENL) population which are predominantly of Iberian and African descent. Given that our ENL students are on 
different points of the continuum of English acquisition, their needs include that of tailored instruction which 
emphasizes listening, speaking, reading and writing skills. Instruction emphasizes both the social and academic usage 
of English to ensure that students are receiving a quality education. Students are also supported through small group 
instruction and academic intervention services aside from rigorous classroom instruction. We have a large population 
of students in temporary housing (STH), who are integrated into our school community seamlessly. We provide 
instructional support and provide them with consistent, meaningful instruction in alignment with the Common Core 
Learning Standards (CCLS). Our STH students need support in social adjustment, such is provided through our Positive 
Behavior Intervention Services (PBIS), assembly programs and individual counseling and health-related programs. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The preliminary School Quality Guide 2018 indicates that there are strengths in the following components of the 
framework: rigorous instruction, collaborative teachers, supportive environment, effective leadership, instructional 
and trust. Despite, having made progress in the areas of trust and strong family-community ties, the school will 
continue to focus on these areas and strengthen our efforts in building resounding relationships with the larger 
community.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Based on the most recent 2018 New York State English Language Arts (ELA) test results, we will continue to build on 
our focus area of making explicit and inferential statements from literary texts as required by Reading Literature 
Standard 1. The second focus area is that of Reading Literature Standard 3, which requires students to use key details 
to describe characters, their motivations, and their change over time and impact on the plot. There is a need to 
continue implementing rigorous curricula with keen attention given to Reading Literature Standards 1 and 3 as well as 
the Common Core Learning Standards Instructional Shifts. This dual focus will facilitate improved student 
performance on the prioritized Common Core Learning Standards and across other Reading strands. The analyses of 
data from the 2018 New York State Report Card, provided by the New York City Department of Education, indicate 
the importance of focusing on the select ELA standards aforementioned. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Enhance students’ ability to: read, write, and manipulate complex literary materials. 

● By June 2019, 2% of students in Grades 3-5 will perform at Levels 3 and 4 in reading, as measured by internal 
assessments such as: simulation tests, unit tests, and summative assessments - to include: the N Y S E L A and 
Mathematics tests, as well as the N Y S Fourth Grade Science tests. In addition, 75% of the students in Grades K-2 will 
demonstrate proficiency in using inferences to reflect comprehension of materials read. They will also demonstrate 
fluency and critical thinking skills, as measured by internal benchmarks, to include but limited to: the DRA2 and year-
long unit assessments attained through class work and assignments.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other 
high-need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

Professional development to support the school-wide 
implementation of the “Ready Gen” program with emphasis 
on addressing the priority standards and the strategic use of 
the program to support English Language Learners and 
Special Education students. Professional development 
opportunities will include: unpacking the priority Common 
Core Learning Standards (CCLS) in school wide and grade 
level meetings, analyzing the Annotated Questions from the 
2018-2019 test, which has been released by the state, so as 
to gain insight into the requirement of the respective 
standards at each grade level, developing questions and 
prompts aligned to each of the priority standards, and 
determine research-based strategies for supporting all 
students including English as a New Language learners and 
students with disability, so that they can master each 
standard. 

Work collaboratively to analyze student work and data from 
assessments which address the priority standards. 
Adjustments will be made to subsequent units and to the 
professional learning opportunities, as needed. Appropriate 
goals and intervention/enrichment action plans will be 
created and implemented for groups of students and 
individual students. Information on student progress, 
performance and next steps will be shared with parents.  

The school offers parent workshops including ENL, GED and 
computer studies. Town Hall meetings, “Back to School 
Night,” parent teacher conferences, Title I meetings, Spring 
Fair and other parent meetings are held to inform parents of 
the learning objectives, goals and initiatives of the school and 
to provide resources to help them support their children in 
meeting their learning targets. We have also established a 
school website to further augment our communication and 
outreach to parents. A parent-student handbook outlines our 
ethical and social guidelines for our students and families 
here at P.S. 53X. Additionally, a monthly parent newsletter is 
sent home with the instructional foci for each grade.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on the comprehensive assessment conducted in June 2018, with respect to teachers' commitment to the 
success and improvement of their classrooms and school, there is a need to increase teachers’ capacity and 
effectiveness in analyzing students’ work and in developing lessons which reflect the instructional shifts with an 
emphasis on text-based answers and academic vocabulary embedded in classroom discussions and student artifacts. 
The analysis of data is essential for effective planning and effectuating meaningful instruction. Data analysis will allow 
pedagogues to identify students’ strengths and weaknesses. Arising from this analysis, the following actions are being 
taken: (1) teachers are organized in grade-alike teacher teams for the purpose of instructional planning and pedagogy, 
as well as to review student-generated artifacts with the scope of enhancing their performance, (2) ninety minutes 
are allocated for planning and review of student-generated work each week, (3) the review of student work is done 
with rubrics and checklists, and, (4) teachers also review data generated from internal and external assessments that 
are used to modify instruction and grouping patterns within individual classrooms. On Monday afternoons during the 
professional development period, teachers are given an opportunity to review systemic practices in English Language 
Arts and Mathematics on a vertical platform so that the trajectory of teaching and learning can be synchronized on all 
grades, Pre-K through 5. There are school-wide breakfasts which allow teachers on all grades to meet, socialize and 
network as a means of enhancing the climate and culture of our school. (5) Strategies to address the needs of ENL and 
SWD students include designing lessons with multiple entry points, differentiated professional development will be 
given to teachers and parents of ENL and SWD students. These approaches have begun to generate measurable and 
observable results in keeping with the design of this plan.

SIFE, STH). 

All academic staff will meet in weekly grade-alike cohorts and 
conduct inquiry work centered around phonemic awareness, 
fluency, automaticity as key components of successful reading. 
Teacher team work will include cycles of: (1) examining and 
analyzing student work to determine student progress in the 
mastery of the standards and targeted shifts, (2) crafting lessons 
with the shifts and supports embedded to support student 
achievement, and (3) review of formative and summative tasks 
to determine rigor and alignment to the standards and targeted 
shifts. 

Teacher teams will meet weekly and conduct inquiry work within

A central Inquiry Team comprising of teacher representatives 
from each grade (K-5) along with supervisors and enrichment 
teachers is assembled. The team will meet weekly for the 
purpose of school wide planning and goal setting . 

The current P.S. 53X website provides parents and the 
community at large with information regarding the curricular, 
enrichment and extended day programs in the school. Specific 
academic areas in need of improvement or additional 
reinforcement will be communicated via parent conferences. 
Monthly parent bulletins will be distributed to inform parents 
about the instructional foci in reading and mathematics from 
Grades Pre-K through 5. Parent workshops will be held to inform 
parents on how to interpret the data with respect to their 
children.

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.)

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) are recruited through professional references, internships and student teaching 
initiatives. Newly recruited teachers are provided a support system. New teachers are assigned peer mentors. 
Mentors assist new teachers in getting acclimated to the school, its culture, curricula, instructional planning and other 
professional development opportunities. Peer mentors also guide new teachers in implementing the systemic 
practices of the school and will share resources, giving careful attention to new teachers’ needs, in an effort to 
improve their pedagogy. Supervisors also provide additional support through formal and informal observations. 

Strategies for Retention 

  Grade conveners assist new teachers with their adjustment to the school, in tandem to their assigned 

mentors. 

  Administrators are available to discuss concerns of the new teachers. 
 

Staff provides new teachers with the resources they need to for teaching and learning. 

Strategies for Assignments 

  Teachers, who are hired, possess certification that match the vacancies of the school. 

Support 

  New teachers are encouraged to attend workshops offered by NYCDOE in late summer. 
  All teachers who are new to the school have the opportunity to foster collaboration and continuous learning 

through our common planning schedule. 

  Teachers choose their own professional goals with administrators during the Initial Planning Conference and 

receive professional development to help them attain their goals. 

  Clear expectations are established and articulated for instructional goals by the instructional leaders. Grade 
meetings and teacher meetings are utilized to provide teachers with the necessary support for clarification, 
data analyses and instructional planning.

2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
In addition to being fully certified and licensed in their assigned areas, current staff will become highly qualified 
through participation in on-site professional development activities, such as grade meetings, study groups and off-site 
trainings, including Emerging Leaders Program, Common Core Fellowship, Teacher Leadership Program and District or 
Department of Education workshops. Participants will then facilitate peer sessions to “turn key” the information and 
knowledge gleaned in teacher led teams. Additionally, in weekly double-period grade meetings led by supervisors or 
grade conveners, teachers engage in instructional planning and data analysis of students’ artifacts such as class work, 
benchmark folders and periodic assessments. Through the process of teacher teams, each individual will have ample 
opportunities to hone his or her inquiry skills. In addition to the menu of professional development opportunities 
previously mentioned, in an effort to build capacity and establish leaders at the various levels of the school, staff 
members are also encouraged to continue their educational pursuit as their needs dictate, such as graduate or post-
graduate degrees and certification in areas of interest. 

Differentiated professional development opportunities will be provided to teachers based upon the goals teachers 
have set at the beginning of the school year as well as the informal and formal observations conducted by school 
administrators. Teachers also partake in a professional learning survey that indicates the type of professional 
development they are interested in. The professional development team will create a calendar that entails the 
professional development sessions that have occurred. These professional development sessions will include on- site 
sessions which are not limited to the following: inter-visitations, study groups, fishbowls, coaching, peer-coaching, 
mentoring, etc. Off-site professional development sessions will also be offered to teachers.

intervention services, etc.). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

We have a longitudinal program in literary studies, Language Arts and Mathematics in Grades Pre-K through 5, with 
an emphasis on developmental appropriateness in grade content materials. These curricula are derived from the 
Common Core Learning Standards. Twice per week the staff collectively engages in professional development around 
Common Core Learning Standards, Charlotte Danielson Framework and the Advance Initiative. Early childhood 
teachers have an opportunity to familiarize themselves with the upcoming grades’ academic expectations. Likewise, 
they also participate in weekly grade-alike meetings or teacher team meetings where they look at artifacts generated 
by students on their respective grades. They engage in data analysis to determine strengths and weakness as well as 
the adjustments deemed necessary to the instructional units. Parent workshops and meetings are facilitated to 
inform parents of the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards. In tandem, the school distributes a monthly 
Parent Bulletin which delineates the instructional foci in the respective subject areas. 

To assist pre-school children who are transitioning from early childhood programs the following will be implemented: 

 

 

School administrators and guidance counselors will provide orientation sessions for incoming Pre-K students 
by June 2019. 
School staff will mail a school brochure to families of incoming Pre-K students to share the school's goals for 
students. 

  Parent coordinator will provide a parent training to families of incoming Pre-K students on how they can 

prepare their children for school. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teachers participated on the Measures of Student Learning (MOSL) Selection Team to determine assessments which 
would be utilized. Additionally, teachers have an opportunity to participate in designing internal school assessments 
such as Performance Based Assessments (PBA) and end-of-unit assessments as well as class assignments and tasks 
which assess students’ performance and achievement. Teachers participate in weekly grade-alike meetings or teacher 
team meetings where they examine artifacts generated by students on their respective grades. They engage in data 
analysis to determine strengths and weakness as well as the adjustments deemed necessary to the instructional units. 
In tandem, they participate in two professional development sessions led by the school’s principal with the collective 
staff from Grades Pre-K through 5. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 53X, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all

At PS 53X, parents are invited to different parent meetings at no cost to the Title III 
program.  There is a long standing relationship with the parents of ELL’s within our community. 
Our principal launched a parental program that has been in effect for the past sixteen years. The 
program entails the teaching of English as a Second Language to our parents of English 
Language Learners. The program meets three times per week for two hours on each day. The 
classes provided to the parents are free. The personnel, who were selected to facilitate the ESL 
parent classes understand the cultural backgrounds and the native language of the parents. The 
parents not only acquire the English language, but they become assimilated to our society, which 
is one of their expressed needs. This class has a technological component to enhance the parents' 
English language.  Computer skills, Town-hall meetings are also held to inform parents about the 
curricula and content students are learning and expected to demonstrate proficiency on the state's 
standardized exams. The parents are also invited to a variety of workshops to learn how to help 
their kids at home. We have a strong parent involvement in our School’s Leadership Team 
(SLT). The parents serve as liaisons between other parents and the school. They share ideas 
generated from the wider parent community during the monthly SLT meetings. Such 
collaboration allows us as a school community to evaluate the needs of our parents and to create 
programs aligned with their expressed needs. The school has a monthly calendar for parents 
which outlines all the activities of the month. During parent workshops, members of staff are 
deployed to assist with translation. -We provide at least one academic workshop for parents of 
ELL's to engage in throughout the course of the year. - Monthly calendars are translated and sent 
home to parents. -All records of attendance and agendas are maintained by the supervisor.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At PS 53X, we utilize the DRA reading assessment to determine students’ strengths and deficiencies in literacy in Grades K-5. 
This 
data informs the administration and teachers whether or not our students are acquiring language in the different strands (i.e. 
listening, 
reading, writing and speaking). The data highlights which student groups are not making sufficient gains in phonemic 
awareness, 
vocabulary, phonics, fluency, etc. An early diagnosis of deficiencies allows us to tailor the curricula to meet the needs of the 
students and create supplemental programs that target those needs.  The data is dissagragated in order to identify what new 
systems can be introduced to move the students' performance.

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

At PS 53X teachers have common prep to meet in teach team discussions about their students' progress and 
difficulties.  Selected students receive I_Ready services to provide the necessary remediation and/or enhancing support   There 
are parent meetings to provide parents with ideas on how to support their children at home. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The ELL students met the AYP expectations and in the testing grades their test scores showed growth. In some cases, ELL 
students outperform the monolingual students.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Students receive I Ready services. Struggling students are also pulled out for academic support.  Instructional task cards are 
designed at the students' 'zone of proximal development'. The school instructional support also provide twenty minutes for 
guided practices to provide direct support to students according to their academic needs.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
After each unit is completed, students take a critierion-referenced test which indicates their academic 
performance. Students are grouped in three tiers. Students who are in Tier III receive academic services, such push in or pull 
out 
services. They are also invited to academies before and after school as well as to the Saturday and holiday academies. 
Students who show no growth receive a more tailored pull out service. In some instsnces, an evaluation process is started to 
further support the child. 
   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
After examining the results in the four tested modalities, we have noted the following patterns: 
• In Grades 1 through 5, the highest scores were in the listening and speaking components of the NYSESLAT. 
• The ELLs in Grades 3 through 5 improved their reading performance; however, there are deficiencies in their writing 
performance. 
   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Teachers will be involved in a professional development series about how to enhance ELLs' writing skills. The students are also 
invited to the Early Academy to enhance their writing skills. 
The students in grade 1 through 5 will be involved in writing and reading activities during the 135 minutes of the literacy 
block.  Teachers will confer with their studnets to enhance their writing skills. 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

        We have students who are pulled out to receive ESL services daily. To avoid students missing English Language 
Arts and mathematics instruction, students receive ESL instruction during content area periods. ESL students receive 
services according their NYSESLAT test scores.  The ESL teacher pulls them out from their classrooms to provide 
services.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

The organizational models that are currently utilized at PS 53X are self-contained transitional-bilingual classes for 
students that consider Spanish as their native language.  Our self-contained transitional bilingual classes spans from 
kindergarten through fifth grade. As their students' English skills improve, the students are moved into classes with 
less instruction in their first language and more English instruction.  Instructional support systems are offered to 
students in those classes.  Our students in the bilingual classes receive a period of Native Language Instruction and 
depedending on their English performance, they receive ESL services. Students are placed in homogenous classes. We 
have a  new arrival class and a transitional bilingual class on each grade.  Content areas are taught in English in the 
TBE classes. In the new arrival classes, the content areas are taught using the shelter instruction. Science instruction is 
rendered in Spanish.  
  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

This is out first year having a self-contained dual language class. Students receive ESL services if they are entitled. 
Instruction is provided in English on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays; meanwhile, instruction is provided in Spanish 
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

              Based on their NYSESLAT performance, ESL services are scheduled.  Beginners and intermediate receive two periods of 
ESL, while advance students receive a single period. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  
In TBE classes, content area subjects are taught in English using the shelter model.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

      The ELLs  in bilingual classes receive NLA and they are assessed on the content taught.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

The self-contained teachers who provide instruction to our TBE, Dual Language and ESL students follow a schedule that is 
aligned to the CR Part 154 guidelines for the amount of language allocated for each proficiency level. In our TBE classes, the 
teachers teach one period of Native Language Arts (NLA) instruction on a daily basis. Our students receive ESL instruction, if 
they are intermediate and beginning level students, our advanced students receive ELA instruction as per CR Part 154’s 
language allocation. Our content specialty teachers teach extra periods of science, social studies and arts to our ELL students. 
In our Dual 
Language class, the students receive instruction for 50% of the time in English, which is done in the content areas (i.e. science, 
social studies and the arts). The instructional target is aligned to the language target.  The instructional tasks are scaffolded 
according to the students' cognitive and linguistic abilities. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

  
   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The teachers follow the school instructional framework. Tasks are designed according to the content/skill being taught 
congruently with the students' abilities. Therefore, the tasks are at the students' zone of proximal development.  
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We have several programs to target the needs of our English Language Learners in literacy, mathematics and the content 
areas. 
One of the programs is the Early Morning Self-Contained ESL Academy. Our ELLs from Grades 3-5 receive additional 
instructional support four days per week, prior to the start of the regular school day. This program is conducted in the 
students’ 
language of acquisition, which is English. The program focuses on helping students who have been receiving ESL services or 
who have been in TBE classes for four to six years. This program targets their weaknesses in acquiring the second language. 
Their biggest deficiencies as a group have been in the areas of reading and writing, which is reflected in their NYSESLAT scores. 
In addition, some of our ELL students in the same subgroup aforementioned also participate in the After-School Enrichment 
Academy. Although some of these ELL students fall into the intermediate and advanced stages of language acquisition as 
determined by the annual NYSESLAT test, they also scored in Levels 3 and 4 on the New York State ELA and Mathematics 
exams. Therefore, the enrichment program targets them for literacy and mathematics in order to teach them strategies that 
will help them demonstrate progress on the New York State ELA and Mathematics examinations. Mastery of select skills and 
strategies will then translate into enhanced performance on the NYSESLAT. We also have Early Childhood after-school and 
spring academies. These academies will target students’ instructional needs in the four strands, listening, speaking, reading 
and writing. These students need to strengthen their foundation in literacy, mainly phonemes, high-frequency words, phonics 
and the structure of the English Language. The academies will be taught in the students’ language of acquisition. 
   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ELLs present difficulty on developing academic writing pieces. This school year teachers will continue using checklist, 
conferencing and modeling how to write academic pieces.  The TAG writng will be used on Tuesdays and Thursdays to engage 
on analyzing their peers' writing and offering ideas to improve the ideas. This promote the peer feedback making the students' 
voice heard and the teacher just offers guidance. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

I Ready, Ready Gen, Wilson, Foundations and Literature Works 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
New arrival students are invited to the Early Academy program. The ELLs who have more than three years in the country and

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Collin Wolfe, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Home Language Surveys indicate that more than 65% of our families consider Spanish as their dominant language, 
therefore all communication to parents is offered in English and Spanish. All parent letters are translated and 
parent workshops are facilitated with a Spanish and French speaking translators. We are also noticing an increase 
number of families who speak French. Therefore, letters are also being translated in French. In tandem, during 
meetings, staff members who are fluent in French translate for the parents. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

The translation team will be placed in strategic locations to translate to parents as per request.  

The evacuation sites and routes are translated so they will be distributed to parents. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

During the Mondays professional development sessions, different sessions are crafted and organized about the CR A-
663. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

There are different welcome posters around the school building, so parents can identify their language to receive 
translation. For major events, such as parent meetings and report cards, we have organized a team of staff members 
to serve as translators. Parents are aware of where to find and/or contact them. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

P.S.53X’s pupil accounting registration data indicates that families from Latin American, Caribbean and West African 
regions have increased. In strengthening our home-school partnership, all parent letters and other documents will be 
translated. Translation will also be provided at parent workshops, back to school night and during parent-teacher 
conferences. This information will be reported to the school community through written communiqués.
