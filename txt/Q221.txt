Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Mission Statement  

At P.S. 221, The North Hills School, our mission is to provide a nurturing learning environment in which students are 
challenged to reach their academic potential through a standards-based, rigorous curriculum. We are dedicated to 
developing and supporting each child’s unique talents within an atmosphere of cooperation and respect for individual 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

differences. Our focus is on the whole child. The North Hills School is committed to instilling in each student a desire 
to learn, to take appropriate risks, to solve problems, and to accept challenges. Teaching the values of good 
citizenship is integrated into all areas of school life. By working collaboratively as a team that includes teachers, 
parents, staff and administrators, we best prepare our students to be independent thinkers, lifelong learners, and 
responsible citizens who will be active and compassionate participants in our society. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 221 believes in high expectations for every student. These expectations are embedded in our curricula and 
classroom instruction, and are effectively communicated to our community of students, staff, and parents. It is a 
school-wide belief that all students are capable of success, and collectively we strive to support our children in 
reaching their learning potential. Coherent standards-based instructional foci are determined through collaborative 
efforts and are based on the needs of our students. We continually work to enhance our school-wide systems for 
communication, data collection and analysis, and safety to support student achievement. 

 

P.S. 221 

Theory of Action - 

Instructional Focus: STEAM learning 

If we continue to increase the knowledge, skills, and practice of all our students in: 

  Oral and written communication 
  Critical thinking 
  Problem Solving 
  Collaboration 
  Applying technology 
  Data driven decision making 
 

Leadership and project management 

Then, our students will be prepared to be contributing members of the 21st Century workforce. 

 

 

We pride ourselves on our warm, welcoming, and nurturing environment which supports student growth, 
achievement, and happiness. The faculty continuously collaborates in order to share strong instructional practices 
that engage all learners. One stand-out feature of our curriculum is our use of Thinking Maps. These are an important 
component of student engagement and learning in our building. Teachers of all grades, including our cluster teachers, 
have been extensively trained in the use of Thinking Maps and are committed to incorporating their use in classroom 
instruction. 
 

Thinking Maps are used school-wide to improve student learning and skills. They support students in organizing 
information and focusing their thoughts to access content, support higher order thinking and discussion, and produce 
more effective writing. Our students have been immersed in Thinking Maps for the past five years and new concepts 
are added each year to enhance the benefits our students derive from their use. This year the maps will be utilized to

support student achievement in science and social studies with the implementation of two new programs in these 
areas, Amplify and Passport, respectively.  

Our students have many opportunities to become active members in our school and greater community. P.S.221 has 
a student government that is responsible for planning and organizing charitable activities that focus on helping those 
in need. We believe in teaching our students the importance of being responsible and caring members of society. To 
increase our strong family-community ties, our entire school participates in community service projects. In the past, 
our efforts have supported the NY Common Pantry, Meals-on-Wheels, The Pajama Project, Book Fairies, and the 
Lexibean Foundation. Furthermore, led by our student organization, our students supported and contributed to the 
Ronald McDonald House-NYC via a coin collection, family welcome and food pantry bags, and the Queens Fun 
Run/Walk in spring 2018. Our students also collect for UNICEF in the fall and donate canned goods to a local food 
pantry during our Souper-Bowl Day. Annually, our fourth grade students share their singing talents and spread joy to 
the seniors during the holiday season at Brandywine Assisted Living Facility under the direction of our music teacher. 
Our students are also empowered to take part in making our school safe and peaceful by being monitors in our 
classrooms, hallways, and at lunch. Finally, our student government plans many exciting “Spirit Days” throughout the 
year, creating fun-filled experiences that unite the students and staff.  

We provide our students with opportunities to interact with the greater community to further enrich the curricula. 
Annually, children’s authors have shared their love of literacy and inspirational speakers share their insights with 
students, family and faculty. Each year we enjoy and learn from these varied presentations which in school year 2017-
18 included author Matthew Burgess and presenter Geri Mariano. For the third year, we participated in an inter-
generational project with our neighbors at the Deepdale Cooperative through a grant they received from the UJA-
Federation of NY. Our students met weekly with seniors to collaborate and create artwork and classroom supplies 
from recycled materials. While discussing, planning, creating and painting, the group shared ideas, laughed and 
learned from each other. Due to the continuing success of this collaboration, we have accepted their invitation to 
participate in another inter-generational project in school year 2018-19.  

Our active Parent-Teacher Association(PTA) is led by dedicated parents who work diligently to organize and sponsor 
many events that enrich our students’ learning and cultural experiences. Throughout the school year students enjoy 
programs which engage, teach, and entertain them. These programs include The STEAM Museum, Hands-on Science, 
The Brain Show, and Journeys into Native American Territories. The PTA also sponsors several fairs including the 
multicultural fair and the international food fair which celebrate the rich diversity of our community. We are 
fortunate to have many parents who eagerly share their time and talents with us through activities including 
classroom visits, family nights, and career days. 

P.S. 221 earned the National Blue Ribbon Award in 2013. Our students are encouraged to work hard and always do 
their best. The message is simple, but the results are impressive. Our strong academic program supports high 
achievement through the work of our conscientious students, the dedication of our talented staff, and the strong 
support of our parents. The equal emphasis we place on respect, responsibility, and caring for others, in addition to 
our academic excellence, sets us apart. From teachers, paraprofessionals and administrators, to the office staff, 
lunchroom and the custodial department, there is a commitment to seeing that the best interests of our students are 
served. 

We believe that every child is a unique gift and capable of success. 

 

Rigorous Instruction: 

At P.S. 221, our staff members are enthusiastic and diligent about sharing best practices and learning as a community 
in order to motivate students and promote high levels of critical thinking, participation, and learning. Our teacher 
teams review the learning standards, design lessons to meet the needs of our students, assess learning, and analyze 
data to inform instruction. We participate in thoughtful reflection to identify strengths, challenges, and common

trends within and across grade levels in order to raise the level of teaching and learning. Furthermore, these trends 
are discussed at vertical planning meetings to ensure all grades are aligned and maintain appropriate, rigorous 
objectives. 

As a school community that highly values professional collaborative learning, we engage in a multitude of methods to 
support our team. Administration and faculty partner to examine best practices and new strategies, and share 
resources that all teachers can utilize in their daily instruction. Through both formal and informal classroom 
observations, administrators provide teachers with specific feedback and recommendations regarding the classroom 
environment, rigor, questioning, student discussion, active engagement, and the use of assessment to guide 
instruction. These professional conversations guide self-reflection and provide opportunities to discuss how teachers 
can further develop instructional practices.  

Rigor within the classroom focuses on differentiated learning activities and discussions. Within our classrooms, 
teachers conduct mini-lessons and facilitate accountable talk among partners, small groups and the whole class. 
Learning is promoted through exploration and discussions which support the attainment of knowledge, the 
development of skills, problem solving, collaboration, and perseverance. Socratic Circles are a strategy utilized to in 
our classrooms to deepen understanding, enhance listening and speaking skills, and build stronger classroom 
communities. As teachers facilitate these conversations they are able to observe, coach, and assess students abilities 
to partake in academic conversations. From these observations, teachers determine multiple entry points and next 
steps in building academic student partnerships and groups. 

The Young Inventors and "Inventioneers" weekly enrichment cluster provides a new learning opportunity for students 
in grades 2-5 as they explore topics of interest, then design and create new products This program culminates in a 
Young Inventors Exhibition which celebrates their creativity, ideas , and inventions. To complement our strong 
academic focus, P.S. 221 features various teacher-run student clubs and teams for our upper-grade students to 
further develop their interests, talents, and confidence. The Green Team, Musical Theater Guild, Tech Team, Artify it, 
North Hills Harmonics, and our Hurricanes basketball team provide students with opportunities for learning, 
teamwork, and leadership development. Our tech team provides interactive demonstrations of our school's latest 
technology for our younger students, including our Pre-K class. In conjunction with their work on these clubs and 
teams, students plan and lead school-wide efforts and activities. Through a grant, we also provide chess instruction 
for our students in grades 2 and 3 which expands their critical thinking and strategy skills. 

Also enhancing our academic rigor is our focus on technology and our extensive arts program. Our computer science 
program's resources include a 3D printer and robots. To foster college and career readiness, our computer science 
teacher emphasizes computer literacy and proficiency with our students participating in code.org, scratch, Tinkercad, 
and website design. In the arts, students receive instruction in visual arts, music, and dance. Our students utilize 
various mediums, including paint, drawing, etching, collages, and creating original pieces through upcycling in the 
visual arts. A highlight for our 5th grade students is creating individual sketchbooks throughout their senior year. In 
addition to vocal instruction, our music program encompasses instrumental instruction which includes 3rd grade 
recorder, 4th grade ukulele, 5th grade guitar, and orf and percussion instruments for our primary grade students. Our 
students varied dance experiences throughout the grades include our annual spring dance festival and ballroom 
dancing for our 5th grade students.  

 

Strong Family-Community Ties: 

Special evenings are organized to further extend the children's learning and engage our families in our school 
community which include Family Art and Fitness Nights, the Science Fair, the Musical Theater Guild, and the Talent 
Show. Through this community-based, multidisciplinary approach to learning, our staff members get to know 
students beyond those in their own classrooms. Our Family Fitness Night, coordinated by our physical education 
teacher, encompasses varying physical fitness activities and sports skills, health literature, and water stations set up 
throughout our school. Family Art Night features staff, student and parent-led art workshops at which families create

projects using varying mediums. Our PTA hosts fall and spring Family Fun Nights for families to socialize, dine, and 
partake in various crafts and games. Our science teacher coordinates a Science Fair involving our entire school 
community. The Musical Theater Guild and Talent Show events provide opportunities for our extended community to 
gather and share their talents as singers, dancers, poets, and writers. Each of these events supports college and 
career readiness by providing students with opportunities to share and develop their individual interests, talents, and 
skills with the support of our staff, school community, and their families.  

In addition to these evening events, parents are invited to special performances by the students, including recorder, 
ukulele and choral concerts, ballroom dancing by our fifth graders, and dance festivals for our pre-kindergarten 
through second graders.  

Our Student-of-the-Month program recognizes a child in every class each month for outstanding efforts in varied 
areas including academics, technology, fitness/sportsmanship, the arts, and personal behaviors. The children who 
have been chosen by their teachers are honored at our monthly PTA meetings where they receive a certificate from 
our state senator and an invitation to the Student-of-the-Month luncheon. Students are the distinguished guests at a 
special pizza luncheon hosted by the principal and assistant principal. This program further strengthens our school's 
culture of learning and good will by acknowledging hard work, acts of kindness, respectful behavior, responsibility, 
and perseverance.  

With a focus on sustainability and green living, our community garden project was launched as a culmination of 
efforts to make science come alive for our children. Our fruit and vegetable garden has taught our children about 
agriculture, increased their appreciation of nature, and enhanced the appearance of our community. Our Earth Day 
celebration includes student-run stations on recycling, up-cycling, gardening, and being eco-friendly. Through the 
strong efforts of our Green team to increase recycling, reusing, and reducing, we were awarded the elementary 
division citywide award for Grow NYC Recycling Champions Program's Super Recyclers Contest. 

Administration, faculty, our parent coordinator, School Leadership Team(SLT), PTA, and families communicate 
regularly to maintain strong partnerships that support student progress and achievement. In order to share our high 
expectations and details about school life, we have numerous avenues of communication. All grade teams and 
clusters produce monthly newsletters with information on the varied content areas for families. These newsletters 
include units of study, specific learning objectives, academic vocabulary, Sanford-Harmony goals, and suggestions on 
how families can help their children at home. Our administration and parent coordinator work closely to arrange 
workshops on topics of interest for our parents. These workshops cross all facets of learning, and include social-
emotional, academic, and safety issues. The topics presented include emotional intelligence, special education, ways 
to handle difficult conversations with children, supporting English as a New Language learners, and preparing for 
middle school.  

With the assistance of our computer science teacher, we maintain a school website which enables parents and 
students to access important information about our school. This website includes links to each grade, the student 
organization, and the PTA. The grade links contain grade appropriate internet links to various reading and math sites. 
Each classroom and cluster teacher manages his or her individual site which contains information such as upcoming 
events, homework routines, and assignments. We are also tweeting school events @PS221team. Furthermore, 
important school information such as notices and schedules are posted on our website, in addition to hard copies 
being backpacked home.  

We use email blasts organized by our parent coordinator and robo calls utilized by our assistant principal to 
disseminate important information to our families. In addition to grade level newsletters, our parent coordinator 
works collaboratively with our PTA to produce a monthly calendar which includes basic information such as trips, 
lunch collection, school-wide assemblies, celebrations, and special evening events. These efforts reinforce the home-
school connection. Our PTA also sends targeted emails to remind parents of important information and deadlines of 
special events, and uses remind.com.

Together, as a united team of school staff and parents, we work to effectively prepare our students for college and 
careers.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Self-Contained Special Education: There are two self-contained classes in the 2018-19 school year. The targets for 
these classes include specific, individualized instruction to maximize student progress in content areas, critical 
thinking skills, and personal-social-emotional growth within an environment where students are supported.  

ICT Special Education Classes: There is one ICT class per grade level in grades K-5 for school year 2018-19. The target 
goals for our ICT students include rigorous, individualized instruction to support their achievement in standards-
aligned curricula.  

English as a New Language (ENL) Students: ENL students in grades K - 5 receive ESL instruction by a certified teacher 
who utilizes a push-in and pull-out model. In kindergarten, grade 3, and grade 4, we have dually certified teachers 
who deliver instruction within their classrooms to all ENL students. We address the needs of our ENL students with 
targeted, small group instruction in language acquisition and development, and content areas to support the 
attainment of knowledge and skills. We also provide social-emotional supports through classroom social-emotional 
teaching programs, and after school programs. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our 2017-18 Learning Survey results in the five elements - Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative Teachers, Effective 
School Leadership, Strong Family-Community Ties, and Trust - were in the range of excellent. In keeping with the 
Chancellor's Equity and Excellence for All initiative, we continue to target rigorous instruction and strong family-
community ties. With an emphasis on problem solving and collaboration, rigorous STEAM-based learning is our 
instructional focus.  

To succeed in the 21st century workforce, our students need to develop their capabilities as critical thinkers, 
communicators, and problem solvers. The jobs of the future, some of which we cannot even fathom, will require the 
understanding of science, technology, engineering, art and math (STEAM). By creating an atmosphere of curiosity and 
inquiry in our classrooms, we will support an environment which values collaboration, risk-taking, imagination, and 
creativity. Furthermore, the implications of work in STEAM-based activities will show children how ideas, discoveries, 
trials and errors, and new solutions can benefit our world.  

This year as part of our rigorous instruction, one of our key focuses will be on communication and collaboration. Using 
the CASEL competencies, and resources from Sanford-Harmony, and the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, we 
will further explore the importance of communication and collaboration in all academic areas, including our work with 
STEAM-based learning. Professional learning will focus on understanding how to best support respectful 
communication and effective collaboration in the classroom starting with our youngest learners in Pre-K.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
As we continue to focus on improving our students skills and knowledge in academic and social-emotional areas, our 
school's administration, teachers, and the SLT have determined that a school-wide priority is to continue our focus on 
STEAM-based learning. This priority will further enhance our mission of providing a rigorous and relevant learning 
experience for our students emphasizing their ability to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. To 
prepare our children for 21st century careers, we aim to increase their engagement in learning tasks integrating 
science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics.  

With a second focus on social-emotional learning this school year, our students will have opportunities to develop 
their interpersonal skills. Both STEAM-based and social-emotional learning support our students' abilities to problem 
solve and work collaboratively.  

Based on a review of our most current quantitative data, the overall proficiency rate in Math for Grades 3-5 was 
79.1% in Mathematics on the 2018 NYS Assessments.  

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Our STEAM-based focus will be on problem solving and collaboration as the Next Generation Mathematics Learning 
Standards cite solving unstructured problems while working with others in teams as part of what it means to be 
mathematically literate. During the course of the year, each grade will engage in 3 STEAM-based learning experiences 
focused on problem solving. Our goal is to increase our overall proficiency rate in mathematics by 3% as compared to 
our 2018 NYS Assessment rate.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
In accordance with the city and district-wide focus on social-emotional learning we will provide our students, staff, 
and parents with opportunities to develop their social-emotional understanding and learning. Over the past several 
years, our work around developing caring, respectful young citizens has incorporated classroom learning 
opportunities focused on kindness and respect. In 2017-18, our school adopted the Sanford-Harmony program which 
was used in all classrooms, Pre-K-5, to foster healthy relationships through the development of social skills. We will 
continue this work in the 2018-19 school year with the addition of the Mood Meter and RULER strategies developed 
by the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. 

Our school's mission is educating the whole child. Through enhancing children's relationship skills, appreciation of 
diversity, and developing their problem-solving and conflict resolution strategies, the social-emotional growth of our 
students is supported. 

Student surveys from school year 2017-18 revealed that 31% of students would be able to calmly telling others to 
stop an offensive behavior. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of our classrooms will develop Sanford-Harmony goals, participate in monthly lessons focused on 
social-emotional learning, and incorporate the Mood Meter and RULER strategies in their interactions to support 
acceptance, collaboration, empathy, and communication with the impact of having 50% of our students be able to 
self-regulate to manage difficult situations as measured by their responses on our student survey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The results of our 2017-18 NYC School Survey Report indicates that 100% of our teachers are actively trying to 
improve their teaching and take responsibility for improving the school. It also shows that 97% of our teachers say 
that their professional development experiences this year have included enough time to think carefully about, try, 
and evaluate ideas, and have the opportunity to work productively with colleagues at their school on professional 
development.  

This data confirms our belief that our strong collaboration supports both teacher and student growth. As committed 
professionals, teachers and administrators will continue to engage in collaborative efforts to better serve the needs of 
our students and the school through ongoing professional development, sharing best practices, and reflecting on our 
challenges and successes. 

Our ADVANCE data showed that there was a .05% decrease in the overall average score for component 1e, Designing 
Coherent Instruction. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will participate on at least one collaborative teacher team, which includes special 
education, ENL, STEAM, SEL vertical, and inquiry, to design instructional plans, analyze data, reflect on practices, and 
identify both grade level and school-wide trends with an impact of an increase of 2% in the overall average for 
component 1e from 2017-18 to 2018-19.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our 2017-18 School Survey Report indicates our high level of effective leadership. In the category of Effective School 
Leadership, the response rates for teachers saying that the principal encourages feedback, and participates in 
instructional planning with teams of teachers were 97%. This strong work in teaching and learning will continue to 
support the professional growth of teachers and staff. A new priority for school year 2018-19 will be the principal's 
leadership in emotional intelligence work and the social-emotional growth of our community. Furthermore, in order 
to build leadership capacity in our school, teacher leaders will be identified by the principal and supported through 
training opportunities and professional learning.  

In school year 2017-18, 54% of Monday professional learning sessions was facilitated by teachers who were leading 
initiatives or turnkeying information from their own professional learning and/or classroom expertise. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the principal will strengthen the school-wide culture of shared and distributive leadership and leverage 
staff strengths by having 80% of teachers participate in activities where they assume leadership roles in the areas of 
professional learning, STEAM, SEL, SE, ENL, content areas, and inquiry team. This increase in leadership roles and 
responsibilities will result in 65% of Monday professional learning sessions being led by teachers.

Guide demonstrates the strong impact of our community outreach and varied methods of communication. The data 
reveals that families are afforded opportunities to participate in classroom activities, are greeted warmly at our 
school, and are well- informed.  

As part of our commitment to encourage and develop partnerships with families and community-based organizations, 
we will provide our students and families with varied opportunities to be involved in life in school, our neighborhood, 
our city, and our world.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 221Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

P.S. 221Q will support parents and families by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand; 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community;  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality

To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; 

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

  hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school 

year; 

  encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams and Parent Association (or Parent-

Teacher Association)  
supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

 
  establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 
  encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; providing written and verbal progress 

reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their children’s progress; 

  developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about 

school activities and student progress; 

  providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a 

format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school surveys and 
feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents and students.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

Begin description here:            
The Title III program is open to all current and former English Language Learners in Grades K-5 
in order to help them meet the Common Core Learning Standards for English Language Arts and 
Math. Our program's rationale is that through providing supplemental small group instruction,we 
further support academic success and language proficiency for our ELL students. This 
instruction will be delivered in English by one certified ENL teacher and three dually certified 
ENL/general education teachers through a 1 hour before school program running on Tuesdays 
and Wednesdays from 7:20am-8:20am.  The students will be divided into four small instructional 
groups, based on their proficiency and grade level. The program will run from October 9, 
2018  through January 30, 2019.  The teachers will focus on language acquisition skills and 
content specific skills and concepts.  Learning activities will be designed to engage students in 
work including phonics, phonemic awareness, word study, decoding, comprehension, and 
writing.  The teachers will use a wide range of strategies including modeling, text 
deconstruction, and contextualization. Student glossaries in their home languages will be also be 
utilized to assist in making meaning. Tools to support learning will include Rosetta Stone 
Software, Thinking Maps, graphic organizers, books on tape and instructional videos. Emphasis 
will also be placed on the 4 modalities of Speaking, Listening, Reading and 
Writing. Instructional materials, which supplement those used in the classroom,  will include 
Phonics and Word Study, Practice Exercises in Basic English, Step by Step Language, Language 
Power, and 2019 NYSESLAT Review books. 
 
An after-school creative arts program, Studio In A School,  will be offered to all ELLs and 
former ELLs in grades K-5 in March - April 2019.  The day of the week will be scheduled based 
on the availability of the instructors and the class will be 90 minutes in length. The artists' 
instructional plans make meaningful links to the curriculum and support the creative, intellectual, 
and emotional growth of the students. Through engagement in multi-step processes, the students 
will be able to problem solve, apply knowledge, and and share their understandings in visible, 
concrete ways.  
Program notification and notices will be distributed in the preferred languages indicated by 
parents. 
Attendance records will be maintained by both the Title III instructional team and our pupil 
accounting secretary.

Begin description here:            
 
Professional development will be given to all teachers of ELLs at our school to train them on 
using appropriate ENL methods, strategies, and techniques to support student 
achievement.  Professional development is focused on improving our teaching methods in order 
to further support the learning of the children entrusted to us. Through the awareness and use of 
specific strategies that enable our ELLs to access the curriculum by seeing, hearing, using, and 
touching,  teachers can positively impact progress.  The team involved in this professional 
development consists of  the ENL teacher, dually certified teachers, and the general education 
teachers of our ELLs.  These professional development sessions will take place four times 
throughout the year on November 19th, January 28th, March 25th and May 20th during the 80 
minute block on  Monday afternoons.  The topics to be addressed will include academic 
vocabulary and language development, TPR, Thinking Maps for ENL students, and 
deconstructing complex text.  The ENL teacher turnkeys training from monthly ELL liaison 
meetings and professional workshops to our staff, and will explain and model skills and 
strategies that support ELLs in language acquisition. Additionally, the ENL teacher will engage 
in planning sessions on Monday and Tuesday afternoons with the grade specific teacher 
teams.  During this time, planning and organizing unit plans, specific lessons, and activities that 
meet the varied needs of the ELLs will occur. Conferencing between classroom teacher and the 
ENL teacher takes place daily as well as on Tuesday afternoons during other professional work 
time. The teachers collaborate on how to address the identified linguistic and academic needs of 
individual students, along with their social-emotional growth. The ENL teacher will increase her 
capacity to effectively carry out the activities in the Title III program through learning 
opportunities presented by the Queens North FSC along with additional support from the ELL 
Services Administrator, and through the acquisition of new materials and learning tools.  
 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

students learning and engaged during the summer months. The workshops presented are 
designed to meet the needs and request of our parents based on their input and feedback to our 
teachers.  Notices regarding the workshops will be translated in the home languages of our 
students and sent home to parents of all of our ENLS and FELLS which includes the Title III 
participants. Additionally, email blasts and messages via RemindApp will be sent regarding the 
workshops.  Parents sign-in at the workshops and translators will be available to 
assist.  Throughout the year, bilingual teachers and staff will make phone calls to parents to 
convey important information to them.  Finally,  parents participate in the school's annual Multi-
Cultural Day and International Food Fair during which they share information, food, games, and 
artifacts from their country of origin.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Formative assessments, which include class work and check-ins, and curriculum-embedded assessments guide our classroom 
teachers in planning instruction and differentiated learning tasks in order to improve student achievement.  TCRWP is one 
assessment tool our school uses to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs.  This assessment helps to determine the ELL 
students' alphabet recognition, phonemic awareness, and independent reading levels. Journeys is our literacy reading program 
which contains weekly assessments as well as end of unit assessments that are administered to students to assess knowledge 
and skills. Also, students are assessed in Math using Go Math beginning of the year, mid-year, and end of year assessments 
along with chapter assessments.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We utilize  a testing schedule which includes TCRWP assessments 5 times over the course of the school year as well as 
beginning, mid-year, and end of year assessments.  There are common planning periods for all teachers during which they 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

work collaboratively to analyze data and plan instruction based on students' needs. Our ENL team meets monthly to discuss 
formative assessment data, student progress, and instructional plans. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of our program for ELLs by analyzing the results of the NYSELAT, and the NYS ELA, Math, and Science 
Standardized  Assessments.  Additionally, we utilize Journeys performance tasks,  Go Math beginning/mid/end-of-year 
assessments, MoSL  assessments, and TCRWP assessments.  All these data sources provide us with information on student 
growth, and achievement.  Historically our ELLs demonstrate needs in areas of writing, decoding, and phonemic awareness. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

ENL teachers and classroom teachers meet weekly and our ENL team meets monthly to collaborate on strategies and monitor 
the progress of students who have been identified as needing additional support.  The RtI team reviews students 
recommended for intervention and determines services.. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
PS 221 analyzes TCRWP running records throughout the school year to identify English Language Learners who need additional 
support.  Students below the grade level benchmark receive AIS/RtI services. Tier I intervention is provided using a leveled 
literacy progam to support and track progress.  In addition, early childhood students receive Fundations instruction at the Tier 
I level. Tier II instruction is provided in small groups for a time determined by the RTI team.  If the child is in need of new 
services for a longer period of time or requires more intensive services, Tier III support and intervention is provided. The 
instructions provided with our RTI is targeted to meet needs that have been identified through varied assessments. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
After analyzing Spring 2017 NYSESLAT and 2017 NYSITELL data, our students are at the following levels:  Kindergarten: 
6 Entering,  3 Emerging, 1 Transitioning, 2 Expanding;  First grade: 1 Entering, 2 Emerging, 1 Transitioning, 4 Expanding, and  2 
Commanding;  Second grade: 1 Entering, 1 Transitioning, 1 Expanding, and 3 Commanding; Third grade: 2 Entering, 1 
Emerging, 4 Expanding and 7 Commanding;  Fourth grade:  1 Emerging, 2 Transitioning, 2 Expanding  and 2 Commanding;  Fifth 
grade: 1 Entering, 1 Emerging, 2 Transitioning,  4 Expanding and 5 Commanding.  As a result of the data analysis, appropriate 
instruction is designed to focus on students’ needs. Our past data has shown that most students advance at least one level per 
year.  New arrivals account for the numbers of entering and emerging students in the lower grades. EDAT data is used to 
identify the modalities in which students are struggling.  This information is used to determine instructional groups and drive 
instruction so students are receiving tailored, targeted teaching. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

During scheduled meetings with administration and the ENL teachers, data is analyzed and discussed, plans are evaluated, and 
adjustments are made.  The discussion at these meetings are the basis for adjustments to the program such as incorporation 
of new strategies and use of different resources (Language Power program, Journeys ELD section). 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

In our stand alone program, we have 1 ENL provider, Ellen Stockstad.  Our students in grades K through 5 are grouped 
in two ways:  heterogeneously by grade level, and homogeneously, according to their proficiency level, by grade 
level.   Instruction is based on reinforcement of core content from classroom.  Collaboration with classroom teacher 
drives this instruction. Emphasis is placed on speaking, listening, reading, and writing in our stand alone program.  In 
our integrated ENL program, we have 3 dually licensed teachers in Kindergarten, 1st grade, and 3rd grade and 
our certified ENL certified teacher.  Instruction is conducted in small groups for core content throughout the 
day.  Strategies such as TPR, scaffolding, and think/ pair/share are utilized.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           The number of instructional minutes a student receives adheres to the regulations mandated by NYS, and is determined 
by student English Proficiency levels as per NYSITELL or NYSESLAT exams.   Entering and Emerging students are allotted 360 
minutes  of ENL instruction per week.  They receive 180 minutes of in class instruction per week.  In grades Kindergarten, 1st, 
and 3rd the dually certified teacher provides these services during literacy blocks which are 45 minutes each, 4 times 
per week.  In grades that don't have a dually certified teacher, the ENL teacher pushes in 4 times per week for one 45 minute 
period during literacy block.  The other 180 minutes is when the student is pulled out by the ENL provider 4 times per week. 
Transitioning and Expanding students are allotted 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week.  In grades Kindergarten, 1st, and 
3rd the dually certified teacher provides these services during literacy blocks which are 45 minutes each, 4 times per week.  In 
grades that don't have a dually certified teacher, the ENL teacher pushes in 4 times per week for one 45 minute period during 
a literacy block.  Commanding students receive 90 minutes of instruction per week for two years following their 
commanding status.  These services are given either by the dually certified teacher or the ENL provider. All of the hours and 
service providers are entered into the STARS system.  Once entered, a report is generated to verify that student, service 
provider, and hours are correct. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Core Content Instruction is delivered in Stand Alone ENL and Integrated ENL by focusing on the Scope and Sequence for 
Science and Social Studies, the NYS Learning Standards for ELA and Math,, and the ESL Standards for Reading, Writing, 
Listening and Speaking. The curricula followed includes Journeys, Teachers College Writing Units, and Go Math. Instruction is 
in English.  Students work in flexible groups, with partners, and independently to develop language proficiency. A variety of 
methodologies are utilized to make content comprehensible such as scaffolding, TPR, visual supports, and fiction and 
nonfiction read alouds.  Glossaries and picture dictionaries are provided in native languages to support learning in the content 
areas.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

When necessary we have staff in the building assist a student in their home language.  Our ENL classroom has bilingual 
dictionaries, books in students' home languages and students also use Google translate.  Students are also able to use all of 
these resources in their classroom.  These supports are used for scaffolding and providing access to content, although our ELLs 
are instructed and tested in English. Students are permitted to use word for word glossaries on classroom tests.  For NYS 
Standardized Math and Science Assessments, students receive translated versions of the exams in their home language or they 
are provided with an oral interpreter if the assessments are not available in their home language.

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Our instructional plan for SIFE students is to provide small group instruction, along with incorporating technology.    Goals 
would be met using instructional approaches and methods such as cooperative learning/group work, discovery, TPR, role play, 
and differentiation. Instruction is differentiated to target our students in the US less than three years based on their 
assessments including NYSITELL, grade level benchmarks, TCRWP running records and NYSESLAT.  Newcomers participate in 
individual conferencing sessions and work in small groups with the teacher.  Grade 3-5 students also receive instruction on 
effective and specific test taking strategies.  All ELL students receiving services for four to six years are targeted with 
differentiated reading and writing strategies.  Reading strategies include finding the main idea, supporting details, fact vs. 
opinion, cause and effect, and using context clues to build comprehension.  Writing strategies include prewriting activities, 
modeling, shared writing, and word walls.  We have 2 long term ELLs who are also SWDs.  Students' assessment are taken into 
account when determining the strategies necessary to achieve ENL proficiency.  In addressing the needs of ENLs-SWDs, the 
ENL teacher has copies of the IEP and instruction is driven by data and student goals. Long term ELLs (6+ years) are required to 
take all state exams in their mandated subject areas.  The ENL teacher and instructional staff adapt curriculum to meet the 
needs of ELLs.  Course work is modified and teachers use varied methods of instruction.  Goals are met by using numerous 
instructional approaches and methods including cooperative learning, role play, differentiation and small group 
instruction.  Former ELLs, in years 1 and 2 after attaining commanding proficiency, are given extra time (tests are not timed 
any longer)  when test-taking and will receive 90 minutes of mandated ENL instruction. The ENL teacher collaborates with 
general education and special education teachers regarding former ELLs progress.  Strategies to support student progress are 
discussed as needed.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
At P.S.221 our plan for ELL-SWDs is to develop critical thinking and comprehension skills. We use a variety of instructional 
strategies and grade level materials to provide access to academic content.  Journey's, Teachers College Writing, and Go Math 
materials are used in addition to Fundations (Grade K-2).  Some instructional strategies include modeling language, TPR, realia, 
visuals, interactive read alouds and close reading. Teachers also use a variety of technology including The Times in Plain 
English, Storia, The New Immigration App and BrainPop to support content area instruction. Additionally, we utilize thinking 
maps, leveled libraries, content word walls, anchor charts, and varied learning activities for student practice, language 
development, and attainment of content area knowledge.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our ELL-SWDs are serviced within the classroom to the maximum degree that flexible scheduling allows. We mainstream 
students for clusters such as Music,  Art, Computer, Science, and Physical Education.  ELL-SWDs also work in inclusive groups to 
achieve English proficiency with ELLs who do not have IEPs.  Our school is focused on having multiple entry points and 
engaging all students. RTI approaches are provided for ELL-SWDs as well, if needed.  Our teachers utilize varied resources to 
address student specific needs which includes determining which literacy program would have maximum impact on student 
growth. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
P.S.221 offers Tier I, Tier II, and Tier III ELA and Math  intervention for all students including ELLs and SWDs. The language of 
instruction is English. Our early childhood students also receive intense Fundations instruction if needed.  Targeted 
instructional groups are created for all ELL subgroups depending on the specific need in ELA, Math, Social Studies, and 
Science.  Data is continuely collected to determine which students need additional support and our AIS/ RTI providers work 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

with students to focus on the individual needs within each group.  Our Entering/Emerging students are given targeted 
instruction.  Before school programs deliver differentiated instruction (speaking, listening, reading and writing) to meet our 
students' needs.  Our ENL teacher provides ENL stand alone services to all Entering/Emerging students targeting language 
acquisition.  Intergrated ENL is targeted in core content areas through the following programs: ELA- Journeys, Writing- 
Teachers College Writing Units of Study, Math- Go Math, SS- Houghton Mifflin Harcourt series, Science- Harcourt, 
HMH Science Dimensions (Pilot program grades 3-4). 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

New programs and improvements for the upcoming year:  
1.  We have three dually licensed teachers General Education & ENL as well as an ENL Teacher.  
2.  New PD hours: All teachers must receive a miniumum of 15% of their PD hours on ELL professional development, while 50% 
of the PD hours of ENL and bilingual teachers must be on ELL professional development.  
3. Integrated ENL/ELA/content area requires pushing-in and co-teaching, fostering greater collaboration between ENL and 
classroom teachers.  
4. In the past few years we have seen an influx of older new comers who are entering the upper grades. Our focus has been on 
language acquisition, and social and emotional development.  Sanford Harmony a social - emotional development program we 
are using school-wide in grades Pre-K-5. 
  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs which include the Student Organization, Tech Team, Green Team, Pet 
Keepers, Musical Theater Guild, Artify it, North Hills Harmonics, Renaissance, as well as the talent show and student-created 
plays. ELLs participate in programs based on interest, need, teacher recommendations, and discussions with 
parents.  Additionally, ELLs are given the opportunity to receive services during the school day including RtI and guidance, and 
participate in the Title III before-school program.  Our school also provides a self-sustaining after school program which assist 
ELLs with homework, socialization, and interest-based learning.  ELLs are able to fully participate in all school programs utilizing 
the help of peer translators or bilingual staff members, if needed.  An after school Leap Literacy Program is offered to all ELL 
and FELL students.  This program runs for approximately 2 1/2 hours, 1 day a week for 6 weeks.  This program encourages our 
students to interact and express themselves in small groups.  The morning ENL program runs for approximately 5 months and 
is offered to all ELL's. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our ELLs are supported through the use of picture dictionaries, Thinking Maps, and listening centers. We use a variety of 
technology supported through the use of SmartBoards, iPads, and computers to reinforce content area instruction. The 
programs used are The Times in New English, Storia, BrainPop, Website New Immigration App. and assorted video clips.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In our ENL program, home language support is delivered by utilizing picture dictionaries and books in the home language.  Our 
school does not have DL or TBE programs.  Teachers, paraprofessionals, service providers, support staff, and students help 
translate for our new ELLs and offer home language support as needed.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Our ENL certified and our dually licensed teachers provide required services based on grade level and need. Teachers work 
with their grade team and Ellen Stockstad to ensure that the resources and services meet the needs of our ELL students. Our 
ENL providers share materials to support all areas of instruction, and modify instruction as needed.  Our collaborative 
professional community meets during PD on Mondays and during other common planning time throughout each week to plan 
and differentiate instruction for our ELLs   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We do not offer any programs before the beginning of the school year to our newly enrolled ELL students. Activities for all new 
ELLs include providing grade and age appropriate books on varied levels, distributing supply lists, and sharing information on 
internet resources, including the school's website and access to our textbooks online.  Our parent coordinator Teresa 
Kirchhofer introduces herself to our new students and parents and invites them to participate in school events including our 
new parent breakfast, adds them to her email blasts, provides  information on our PTA, and encourages all to attend our Back-
to-School Night.  Our guidance counselor meets with new admits to assist in their acclimation to our school.  Additionally our 
ELLs in grades 2-5 are invited to our district's summer Title III program.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Part of our goal to grow as professionals and ensure that we are meeting the needs of all our students is to participate in 
professional development.  The ELL providers will participate in many professional development opportunities this school year 
including Thinking Maps, Journey's training, Go Math, and NGSS workshops. Information garnered at off-site professional 
development by any pedagogue is turn-keyed to all staff including our ELL providers, administration, classroom teachers, 
paraprofessionals, guidance counselor, social worker, special education teachers, occupational/physical therapists, speech 
therapists, secretaries, and our parent coordinator, when appropriate. Professional development hours can be done through 
in-person trainings and meetings as well as through online learning. Videos can be found on the ELL Educator Resources page 
at http://schools.nyc.gov/Academics/ELL/EducatorResources/default.htm. The FSC also provides training and development for 
teachers. Monday PD days are programmed to support teacher learning through turnkey meetings as well as bringing in 
presenters from outside the building. These PD sessions support teachers in delivering standards-aligned, rigorous instruction 
which supports ELLs in being college and career ready. 
The calendar of professional development dates for the current year will be as follows: Oct 30th  ; Nov. 27th  ; Dec. 18th Jan 
29th  ; Feb 26th  ; Mar 26th  ; Apr 30th  ; May21st  ; & Jun 25th .   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

To support our staff in assisting our ELLs transition from Elementary to Middle School, the ENL Teacher and the School 
Guidance Counselor have on-going communication with staff at the Middle School level regarding transitioning of our fifth 
grade students. Discussions include the students’ academic strengths, weaknesses, and learning styles, along with any 
pertinent data that may inform instruction. 
A minimum of 15% of the required professional development hours for all teachers must be dedicated to language acquisition, 
including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English 
Language Learners.  For all bilingual and English as a new language teachers, a minimum of 50% of the required professional 
development hours must be dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a 
focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language 
learners.  For each PD, agendas are distributed and sign-in sheets are passed around for attendance purposes.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Each year we hold an ENL Workshop for all parents of ELLs, and this year included parents of FELLs.  Throughout the school 
year, Ellen Stockstad will contact parents via a letter or phone call to set up individual appointments during her Tuesday parent 
engagement time or another mutually convenient time. These meetings can be face-to-face, email, or over the phone, and 
may include a interpreter if necessary. She will continue to support ELL parents by setting up other individual and group 
meetings as needed. Attendance will be recorded, maintained, and filed in the ENL classroom.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
PS 221 recognizes the importance of involving our parents in our school community. All parents are welcomed into our school 
and encouraged to ask questions, express their needs, and participate in school life. Our PTA meetings introduce parents to 
our ELL programs, the school's goals and objectives, learning standards, and assessments. Our parent coordinator works 
cooperatively with our school's administration and our teachers to provide workshops that are aligned with curriculum 
standards. She also provides relevant information to the entire school community; she shares information at parent 
orientations, and through school newsletters, flyers, calendars, email blasts, and the school website.  Information is translated 
into our students' home languages. The parent coordinator also reaches out to the school community to request assistance 
for new ELL parents.  Many parents offer to provide translation/interpretation services for newcomers and encourage them to 
become involved in school events. We have a Multi-Cultural Fair and International Food Festival where all ethnicities  are 
represented and celebrated.  We have bilingual staff who are fluent in Chinese, Korean, Spanish, and Greek. They are available 
to interpret at workshops, meetings, and events.  Notices are sent home in all languages available or stamped on top with 
"Important Information, Please Translate" in the major languages.  We also utilize NYCDOE translation services. Data is 
collected and analyzed from the school survey to determine the needs of our parents which guides future workshops.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Patricia Bullard, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At enrollment our ENL teacher meets with parents to make an initial determination of the child's home language. 
The ENL teacher also reviews the following ATS reports to determine written translation and oral interpretation 
needs: Preferred Languages RCPL, RPOB, RHLA, RBIR, the RLER-NYSITELL, and the RLER-LAT. The ENL teacher and 
pupil accounting secretary additionally check the Blue Cards to cull data on language preferences for 
communication. Attendance records are kept for parent/teacher conferences, workshops, and meetings which 
indicate when the translation unit is used. Our ENL teacher distributes surveys to parents to determine parent 
needs, concerns, requests, and interests in order to better serve them and their children. During both day and 
evening parent workshops, LEP parents are provided with either Translation Unit translators or parent volunteer 
translators.
