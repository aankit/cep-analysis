Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Vision Statement - Small school, big hearts, building a legacy of excellence.  

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Mission Statement - At PS 26, The Carteret School, we believe that the best way to ensure our students’ future is to 
give them the skills, ability and confidence to go out and create it. We will respect each student that enters our 
building by celebrating, and developing their uniqueness. Students are nurtured in a small school environment and 
receive individualized attention. We cultivate strong leadership skills in each student to enable them to make a 
difference in this world. As such, our students will develop the skills they need to make informed decisions as 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

independent critical thinkers. They will be active participants in their community, and learn the role of civic 
responsibility.  

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Carteret School is an elementary school with 282 students from grade Pre-K through grade 5. The school 
population comprises 2% Black, 33% Hispanic, 54% White, 10% Asian, and 2% other students. The student body 
includes 10% English language learners and 24% special education students. Boys account for 48% of the students 
enrolled and girls account for 52%. P.S. 26 is a small community school. It is truly a school where everybody knows 
your name. We have dedicated staff members who seek to ensure student success. One of the things that makes P.S. 
26 unique is the level of cohesiveness found across all classrooms. All staff members, including paraprofessionals, are 
integral members of the professional learning community. We are all highly invested in our students’ growth and have 
a shared belief and mission to impact their lives. Every member of our community shares this belief and does what is 
needed to support the school’s goals. We are a responsive professional learning community that works together to 
meet the needs of all students. 

To support our belief in educating students socially, emotionally and academically, we use the Leader in Me 
framework based on the work of Steven Covey – Habits of Highly Effective People. All professional learning is 
specifically tailored to our school. All professional learning is co-presented by the Principal, Instructional Coach, 
Teachers and any outside consultants and is individualized to school needs. Like our curriculum, we do not believe in a 
one size fits all approach to professional learning and seek to differentiate to meet the needs of all staff. Any outside 
professional learning is customized to meet our specific needs. We spent additional time this year working on school-
wide initiatives that support our students' social and emotional growth. All staff was introduced to Growth Mindset 
(Carol Dweck) theories and spent considerable time working on curriculum units that introduced these theories to our 
students. We spent professional learning time reading Power of Words (Responsive Classroom) to support school-
wide structures for development of teacher language (use of words, phrases, tone and pace) to enable students to 
engage in active, interested learning. Our school has partnered with the UFT Teacher Center, and as such we have a 
designated Teacher Center for professional development. We have a full time Instructional Coach to support this 
partnership that is funded through the school budget. The school has a strong emphasis on professional learning as 
evidenced by ongoing in-house professional development.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

As a school community, we met to examined our previous and current data. We created school goals around three 
distinct areas of growth – Academic Goals, Social Emotional Goals and Culture of Leadership. Within each area we set 
school goals designed to maximize instructional outcomes. Our staff worked to align our CEP/School goals at three 
distinct levels – school, classroom and student. Teacher teams met to create action plans based on an analysis of 
current student work samples and assessment data. Each grade level takes into account developmentally appropriate 
practices and major content emphasis. Benchmark timelines were established and assessment criteria identified for 
student progress toward meeting identified goals. At the student level, goals are individualized using CCLS and grade 
expectations as the end in mind targets. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

P.S. 26 currently has 24% students with disabilities and 10% ESL. Additionally, 43% of students are eligible for free 
lunch. Our classes are comprised of one Integrated Co-Teaching class per grade from K - 5. We offer services within 
the classroom setting to ensure successful transference of learning to grade level standards. Our students in the ICT 
classroom are predominantly speech and language impaired. We have a full time Speech Teacher on staff to address 
their needs. Additionally, we have a full time ESL teacher on staff. We offer ESL services within the classroom, with 
any additional minutes required outside in smaller settings. Our ESL students continue to make strong growth each 
year as evidenced by results of our NYSELAT exams.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Looking closely at our data, we identified areas of celebration and concern. When setting goals for the school, we 
took this data into account, but also took into account the unique characteristics of our small group. We have created 
a culture of trust in which we all work collaboratively to improve student achievement. All stakeholders at P.S. 26 
work toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school and beyond. 
Across the community, there is respect. As a result we have a highly supportive environment in which students feel 
safe, supported and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Areas of Progress  

1) Our Environment Rating also was Exceeding Target. (Supportive Environment) 

We have made significant progress establishing a supportive environment for staff, students and their families. 100% 
of our staff has received training in TCIS - Therapeutic Crisis Intervention Strategies. We have developed a common 
language and response protocol to ensure the social and emotional needs of all are being met. Additionally, we foster 
an environment where risk taking is valued and mistakes are seen as learning opportunities (growth mindset). This 
has empowered our staff to move forward professionally and be willing to engage in new learning. It has further 
empowered our students to be more active participants in the learning process.  

 

Area of Focus: 

Our recent Quality Review identified 1.1 – Pedagogy as an area of focus. We are rated Proficient on this indicator with 
evidence that leaders and staff believe that students learn best through responsive instruction that meets them 
where they are as learners, provide opportunities for independent thinking through engaging activities, and allows for 
student-to-student discussions. Student research projects, graphic interactive board displays, and students’ 
notebooks reflect high levels of student thinking and participation, however, evidence of student ownership was not 
visible in a few classes visited. Though we consistently engage in inquiry work to set learning goals, we are working to 
improve our learning tasks to ensure that all students are challenged to their maximum potential. We are engaged as 
a staff in a study of the power of developing growth mindsets and providing productive struggle within unit plans. We 
worked this year to increase student engagement at all levels through creation of structures that ensure consistency 
across grade levels and content areas.  

 

 Our focus this year will be on Rigorous Instruction. As a school, we are engaged in learning partnership with Teachers 
College Reading and Writing Project. We are working to ensure that rigorous instruction is happening across all 
classrooms. We have created protocols for teachers and students to evaluate learning against standards based 
learning progressions. The Framework for Great Schools report indicates the need to further develop instructional 
practices for our lowest performing students. We have made strides in the area of providing instruction within the 
least restrictive environment, but we need to better develop systems to create differentiated instructional tasks, as 
well as opportunities for student voice and choice, for all students.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Recent PPO Visits (2017-2018) identified rigorous instruction and using feedback to foster deeper learning in 
classrooms. While some classrooms foster high levels of student thinking, engagement and student ownership of 
learning, others are not consistent with these practices. Though we consistently engage in inquiry work to set learning 
goals, we are working to improve our learning tasks to ensure that all students are challenged to their maximum 
potential. We are engaged as a staff in a study of the power of working in Impact Teams. We have a partnership with 
Core Collaborative and NYC DOE CARP to foster our teachers knowledge of how to use the formative assessment 
process to differentiate and drive instruction. We are working to increase student engagement at all levels through 
creation of structures that ensure consistency across grade levels and content areas. 

 

Our instructional focus is to improve clarity of instruction through the use of high quality formative assessment 
processes. We seek to ensure that learning is targeted to students' specific needs and that they are aware of their 
learning expectations and goals. All students will be placed on a continuum for each focus standard, and matched 
with appropriate level tasks. They will be taught protocols for self assessing and receiving feedback. Additionally, we 
seek to ensure that learning is visible to all – teachers, students, families. This will be accomplished through strong 
communication with parents of learning expectations.  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 80% of students will make at least one year's progress as evidenced by Teachers College running records 
(K-2) and Serravallo Independent Reading Assessment (3-5).

Environment) Additionally, on the NYC School Survey, 94% of respondents felt that our school maintained safety and 
order. Our social emotional learning ranking on this data source was 90%. On our 2017-2018 Quality Review, we 
received Well Developed in (3.4) Establish a culture for learning that communicates. We have established a culture for 
learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students and families, and provide supports to achieve those 
expectations.  

On our 2017-2018 Quality Review, an area of focus was (1.4) Maintain a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes 
that supports the academic and personal growth of students and adults. We have identified the need to work 
together with teachers to establish structures to support the social and emotional developmental needs of all 
students and to ensure all students have equal access to high quality instruction. Further, we seek to create 
consistency school-wide as to how we respond to students in crisis. We have identified a target population of 
students who are at risk socially and/or emotionally and will set up systems and protocols to support their coping 
skills. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 25% of students identified as socially and emotionally at risk will demonstrate increased coping skills as 
evidenced by analysis of school's incident reports (OORS).

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Data analysis from 2017-2018 benchmarks and end of year MOSL indicated growth in Elaboration trait (Trait 3). We 
still have a school-wide weakness in Elaboration trait, with 50% below proficiency. Therefore, this year's focus for P.S. 
26 writing will continue to be on increasing elaboration skills across standards based units of study.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the 
instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. Our rating for this area of the framework 
has consistently been Exceeding Targets.  

School Survey data indicated that teachers trust the Principal at her word. (97%) Further, it indicated that they trust 
each other and seek opportunities to work collaboratively. Our learning community has been forged and the culture 
of trust established.  

Linking this component with 5C:Collaborative Teachers, we seek to create leadership opportunities for school staff, 
enabling us to build capacity, as well as provide differentiated professional learning opportunities to all. Specifically, 
we will continue to cultivate teacher leaders across grade levels who can become representatives on our Instructional 
Team. With the inclusion this year of Integrated Co-Teaching on each grade level, as well as two classes per grade, we 
can now have at least 2-3 teachers per grade. This provides us the opportunity to create leadership roles and give 
more voice to our teachers on our Instructional Team. These leadership roles will enable teachers to work 
collaboratively and provide feedback on instructional practices as critical friends. Last year we created a system using 
Peer Intervisitation Learning Walk protocols. These teacher leaders can now guide the process of peer observation of 
instruction using the protocols.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, as a result of 100% of teachers' participating in at least 4 teacher-led learning walks, using the school-
created protocol for providing feedback, 80% of teachers will achieve Effective or Highly Effective ratings on component 
3D, as measured by observational data from Advance Dashboard.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 26, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input.  

 

 

P.S. 26 will support parents and families of Title I students by:

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Based on 2018 NYSESLAT results,  3% of our ELLs are on the EN/EM level;  9% are on the TR 
level, 59% are at the EX level and 30% are at the CM level.  Based on current 
NYSITELL scores, 30% are on the EN/EM level; 40% are on the TR level and 30% are at the 
EX level.  Of the ELLs tested in 2018, 0% of students scored at a Level 1,  55% of students 
scored at a Level 2, 45% of students scored at a Level 3, and 0% of students scored at a Level 4 
on the NYS ELA Test. Of the ELLs tested in 2018, 11% of students students scored at a Level 1, 
33% of students scored at a Level 2, 22% scored at a Level 3, and 33% scored at a Level 4 on the 
NYS Math Test. Out of this number of test takers, 5 (55%) are ELL-SWD students. 
Our school focus is to improve communication skills by fostering conversations in a small group 
settings that improves listening comprehension, speaking and writing in response to shared 
texts.   PS 26 will use the  program Talk About Books Guided Reading kits from Mondo for 
students in grades K-2. This highly engaging, interactive program develops students' 
comprehension with an emphasis on talking about texts and meets Common Core and State 
Standards. The students' books feature engaging non fiction and fiction content with built in 
comprehension and academic language support.   Additionally students will be provided 
opportunities to craft written responses to texts read.   Students will be exposed to all modalities 
of language, through the use of shared text sets. We will also be using the Leveled Literacy 
Intervention Kits (LLI) . These lessons are designed to deepen comprehension through close 
reading, increase engagement, build phonics and word knowledge, and increase volume. 
Students will be instructed using guided reading, shared reading, and close reading strategies.  
We will also be purchasing additional Big Books (from the National Geographic Reach Set). 
These Big Books have photographs and pictures that will engage all of the students and will 
allow them to access their schema. The Big Books will be used for Shared Reading activities.  
We are inviting all of our ELL students on all proficiency levels from grades K-2 to participate 
in this Title III program.  
The program will have cycles ( one for Kindergarten, one for 1st Grade, and one for 2nd Grade). 
We will be focusing primarily on Grades K-2. 
The Second Grade program will take place on Wednesdays from 2:45 - 3:45 PM, beginning in 
October 2018 and ending in May 2019.  All instruction will be provided in English, with 
bilingual supports as needed.  The ENL teacher Miss J. Mulligan will conduct this program.   
The Kindergarten Before School Program will take place from October to May on Tuesday 
mornings from 7:00 to 8:00 am.  
The 1st Grade Before School Program will take place from October through May on Friday 
mornings from 7:00 am to 8:00 am. 
We would also like to subscribe to Raz-Plus to give our ELLs access to digital literacy and take 
advantage of any translation features that are included, so that families can also be involved with 
the student's literacy education at home. 
Our ELL students will be receiving additional support in developing and enhancing their 
listening, speaking, reading and writing skills through lessons aligned to common core learning 
standards. Students will be engaged in activities that are designed to increase their critical 
thinking skills, as well as language acquisition in English.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Our ENL teacher is implementing strategies from the work of Dr. Lily Wong Fillmore ad Mrs. 
Cucchiara(an associate of Dr. Fillmore), which mainly focuses on text complexity, close reading 
and the teaching of academic language. Teachers pre-teach vocabulary words and ask text 
dependent questions, followed by deconstructing and re-constructing rich (juicy) sentences. In 
addition, our ELL students will participate in small group Guided Reading lessons, Shared 
reading, as well as small group word study activities to develop their phonemic awareness and 
knowledge of sentence structures. Students will increase their writing abilities through intense 
small group instruction while practicing oral language through academic discussions (turn and 
talk). Teachers will provide students with different scaffolds, such as, graphic organizers, 
thinking maps, linguistic frames and sentence stems to enhance students’ writing.  
 Attendance records will be maintained for each session and kept in the ENL teacher's files. 
Notification about the Title III programs will be sent home in the parents' preferred languages. 
Descriptions of the programs will also be discussed during the Parent Orientation meetings. All 
information will be posted on our school's website, including the calendar of events, resources 
used and special announcements. This information can be translated into over 100 languages.

Begin description here:            
Ongoing professional development will be provided for the teacher delivering the Title III 
instruction through attendance at targeted professional learning course and during the mandated 
Monday PD time of 2:25-3:40. Staff members who have ELL students clustered in their 
classroom are mandated to participate in the training which will occur during Monday PD 
blocks.  Any classroom teacher interested in the training is welcome to join these PD sessions 
with the Principal's approval. PD specifically designed for ELLs can count toward the general 
and special education teachers' CTLE hours. 
The following professional development course work will be completed by the teacher working 
in the Title III program: 
The Power and Risk of Scaffolds for English Language Learners: A Focus on Fiction Reading 
Grades K-5 - This course is provided through Columbia University Teachers' College.  The 
course is designed to arm teachers with a variety of strategies for supporting students at varied 
levels of English language acquisition thrive within the reading of fictional texts, think about 
ways to scaffold and provide access to critical reading work by strengthening their language 
skills.  This course work connects strongly to our focus on improving ELL students' 
communication skills, due to its focus on the use of collaboration/partner work to improve ELLs' 
language skills. 
Reading Toolkits Institute: Maximizing the Power of Tools and Helping Kids Use them with 
Independence - This course is provided through Columbia University Teachers' College.  The 
course is designed to arm teachers with toolkits to support ELLs reading growth; including 
charts, microprogressions, practice texts and other tools that make teaching more concrete, 
specific and responsive.   This course work connects strongly to our focus on improving ELL 
students' navigation of varied text sets due to it's focus on the use of targeted scaffolds to support 
students' independence when reading.

January 16, 2019 and Monday, February 18 - Wednesday, February 20, 2019.   Additional dates 
and topics pertaining to ELLS provided by the Staten Island Borough Field Support Center. 
This course work will positively impact the progress of ELLs by developing teachers' knowledge 
about the ways to enhance student access to varied types of text.  The teacher conducting the 
Title III after school program, Miss Mulligan, will be responsible for leading targeted PD during 
Monday PD time that will increase the knowledge base of teachers working with 
ELLs.    Teachers will learn how to develop students' communication skills in small group 
settings through the use of purposeful talk.

Begin description here:            
PS 26 always encourages parent involvement. Due to the Common Core Learning Standards 
expectations, the implementation of Teacher College, the Eureka math program, and current 
social issues, we always seek to assist our parents in supporting their children academically and 
socially at home.  Our UFT TC Coach will conduct a parent survey at the beginning of the 
school year to ascertain the types of workshops our ELL parents are most interested in 
participating in, as well as uncover any barriers which may prevent them from doing so. Once we 
have completed this needs assessment, classroom teachers and the ENL teacher will create a 
schedule of offerings for parents.  Workshops will be provided during the monthly 
PTA meetings by classroom teachers and the ENL teacher.   
Many of the workshops will focus on common terminology used in classrooms. This is 
extremely helpful for our ELL parents in order for them to become familiar with the everyday 
language their children are learning and conversing within the school. As a result, a variety of 
parent workshops will be offered every month throughout the school year. All parents including 
our ELL parents are always invited to attend. All workshop notifications are sent home and 
posted on the school's website. All postings on the school's website can be translated into the 
parents' preferred languages. Bilingual paraprofessionals and/or outside translators will be 
available as indicated by parent request for all workshops. 
The following Parent Engagement activities will take place: 
TBD based on needs assessment and coordinated dates with our PTA 
September 5, 2018: New incoming Kindergarten 10:00 AM 
September 17, 2018:  Meet and Greet/Parent Information Workshops 6:00 PM  
Dates to be determined: 
- Bedtime story night (families are invited in to read bedtime stories with their children) 
- Math family fun night (math games will be introduced for families to play at home) 
-Multicultural Night (food tastings from around the world) - Parents/Families will be asked to 
make a cultural food and families will be invited in for a food tasting event

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Copies of all agendas, attendance sheets and invitations will be kept by the Parent Coordinator. 
All ENL specific parent activities and workshop notifications, attendance sheets and agendas 
will be kept in the ENL teacher's files. 
In addition, during the school year parents will be invited into the classrooms to attend writing 
celebrations and all other celebrations of learning. Parents will be invited to attend monthly 
theme-based parent learning walks (which would include visits to the classrooms). This would 
allow opportunities for parents to see how their children are learning in the classrooms. Parents 
will be guided by the administration and will be given a lens to look at (they will have 
opportunity for feedback and debrief also). Translators will be provided if necessary. 
Parents will also be invited to attend workshops explaining the curriculum so that they can be 
involved in their students' learning. These workshops will occur during the Tuesday Parent 
Engagement time and/or before PTA meetings. The workshop topics will include a review of the 
EngageNY Math curriculum, how to choose just right books for home, and how to help your 
child with writing at home. 
If going on trips, parents are invited to attend to enhance the learning experience for their child.

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 The early literacy skills of our ELLS are assessed using the Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) 
assessment.  This tool allows us to assess the student’s letter and word recognition, reading fluency, retelling, and 
comprehension.Our school  also uses the Serravallo Independent Reading Assessment to assess the comprehension skills of 
our  ELLs. The Independent Reading Assessment allows teachers to plan data driven reading instruction to help our students 
unlock complex texts. We also use Performance Assessments/Tasks/MOSL to assess our students writing skills. These tools 
allow us to assess the writing based on structure, grammar, and mechanics. Using this data, the students are placed into small 
groups where instruction can be differentiated and scaffolded according to their needs and level.The TCRWP assessments has 
a sight word assessment. In Kindergarten through first grade, the data shows that students who have mastered all of their 
sight words do better in reading. Sight words are difficult for many ELLs because there are no cognates for them to relate to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

and they do not follow the regular patterns on phonics and spelling. Once the students have mastered these sight words, 
many of them start to really show progress in reading. For example, two students mastered all of their sight words according 
to the assessment from TCRWP and both of these students were above grade level in reading by March, whereas those 
students who did not master the sight words, were reading below grade level. This data will help inform instruction in grades K 
and 1; during ENL times, there should be activities that allow students to have repeated practice with the sight words.  
The previous data showed that students who were below grade level going into 3rd grade, really struggled to move up in 
reading levels during that year and in the upcoming years. In order to make sure that students are able to continue making 
progress, students who are reading below their grade level by 2 levels or more will be instructed using a Reading Recovery 
type model built into the meeting time. Last year this model was implemented and 4 out of the 4 students that were reading 
below level, ended the year on grade level. 
Teacher created formative assessments (based on the MOSL) for writing are being used to guide instructional planning for the 
ELLs. This year we saw a weakness in the elaboration strand on the rubric; therefore, our focus for next year’s instructional 
plan will be teaching elaboration in writing. Each grade will have a set focus (for example, Kindergarten and First Grade will be 
focused on adding descriptive factors using the 5 senses) and they will plan their instruction accordingly. 
Other standards-based teacher created formative assessments and checklists are also being used to check in on the skills and 
strategies that are being taught during read aloud. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

This year we are starting up a brand new impact team structure; this structure will support the efforts of ensuring that the 
formative assessments mentioned above and all formative assessments are ongoing throughout the year and are being used 
to guide instructional planning for all students, including ELLs. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 We evaluate the success of our ELL program by looking at the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, and State exams. We determine if students 
have made progress from year to year. If we see an improvement and student growth, then we continue to use strategies that 
are helping the child. When we do not see improvement, we look at what else could be done to help the child grow (such as 
grouping, strategies, push-in periods, etc.). We also evaluate the success of our ELL program by keeping track of student work, 
not only the State exams, noting the growth of our students from year to year.    
We also use the NYC Performance Tasks for ELA and Math. These summative assessments are usually given at the beginning 
and end of the year. These summative assessments are used to identify baseline data and to track the progress that the 
students made throughout the year. In order to help our teachers monitor the student’s progress and to track areas of need, 
our teachers are working on making similar assessments that can be used during the other check in points during the year. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

This year we are starting up a brand new impact team structure; this structure will support the efforts of ensuring that the 
appropriate interventions will be put in place to address student needs. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
In order to guide instruction for ELLs, we use different forms of data. We begin by analyzing the Teacher’s College Benchmark 
reading levels to identify the students that are not meeting the standards for their grade level. We also use NYSESLAT results 
to determine other ELLs who will benefit from the RtI framework. This may include students who are Entering(Beginner) or 
Emerging and Transitioning (Intermediate)  level students.  If a student is approaching the standards, they receive Tier II 
instruction, according to the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework. These students receive additional periods of literacy 
instruction throughout the week.  If a student is far below the standards, students receive Tier III instruction. These students 
receive additional periods of literacy instruction, either individually (1:1) or in a group of no more than three (1:3).   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

 The NYSITELL results show that students with some knowledge of English are scoring higher on the NYSITELL. This seems to be 
that the NYSITELL is so heavily focused on oral language and speaking. As a result, true newcomers would be the only students 
to score low on the NYSITELL. In order to overcome this, students in grades K and 1 will receive more push-in service during 
literacy instruction to improve students reading and writing skills. Also, students with older siblings seem to score better on 
the NYSITELL. The data shows that 3 out of 6 children who have siblings scored in the Expanding category with 1 additional 
student scoring at the Commanding level. Most of the Kindergarten students attended Pre-K, which allowed them to develop 
some English language skills. Out of 10 kindergarten students, 9 went to Pre-K, 4 of these students scored Expanding and 1 
scored Commanding. In 2016-2017, 5 students were given the NYSITELL so far and 4 out of 5 will be receiving ENL services. 
Only 3 of these students scored Entering; the rest were in the High Intermediate or Expanding category. 24 students were 
given the NYSESLAT; 4 students scored Commanding, 3 students scored Emerging, 1 student scored transitioning, and the 
other 16 scored Expanding. Writing was the lowest scoring modality with all of the writing scores under a 13. These students 
will receive small group instruction to really focus on their areas of difficulty. The NYSESLAT data reveals that most students 
score well in Listening and Speaking, but struggle in applying their Reading and Writing skills to specific content areas. Since 
writing is a struggle for all students, the focus will be on helping students to develop their writing skills so that they can write 
clear, organized, and well-developed essays. The NYSESLAT data shows that across grade levels our students are performing 
better in the speaking and reading subtests. This may be due to the Socratic Discussions that have been happening in all 
classes. Also this past year, we started using a Reading Recovery based model with our first and second graders to help them 
reach their grade level goals in reading. On the NYSESLAT, we had 5 students take the NYSESLAT and 3 out of 5 
scored  Commanding this year. Our students had a more difficult time with listening and writing, so maybe we will have to look 
at a way to better support these areas of instruction. This year we are working on creating progressions for the students to use 
in writing, where they will have a specific success criteria. 
   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ENL teacher has access to ATS so that she can easily access the outcome assessment data. During the summer when the 
scores come in, the ENL teacher meets with the principal and/or assistant principal to review the data and to discuss any 
adjustments that need to be made to the tentative programming schedule. The findings are also shared with the classroom 
teachers so that adjustments can be made inside the classroom as well.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our school has a mixed model of instruction; we have a pull-out (stand-alone) and push-in (integrated) model of ENL 
instruction. We try to put the ELLs in one class so that it is easier to facilitate the push-in/integrated model of 
instruction. We have an integrated Push-In model for kindergarten, first, and second grade. The ELL teacher and the 
classroom teacher work collaboratively to plan and implement engaging lessons that meet the needs of all learners. 
Pull-out groups are put together according to grade. For example, we have a Third and Fourth grade group. Our ELL 
teacher has 4 licenses: Childhood Education, TESOL, Students with Disabilities (Special Education), and Literacy 
Education (birth-6 th). Any students are the beginner/entering and low intermediate/emerging level will receive 360 
minutes of instruction: 180 minutes of standalone and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA. Intermediate/Transitioning 
students will receive 180 minutes of instruction: 90 minutes of standalone ENL and 90 minutes of integrated 
instruction. Advanced/Expanding students will receive 180 minutes of integrated instruction. Proficient/Commanding 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

students will continue to receive 90 minutes of integrated instruction to help them transition and continue to acquire 
academic vocabulary.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

We do not currently have a TBE program due to lack of parent interest/request. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

We do not currently have a DL program due to lack of parent interest/request. 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The principal requires a copy of the ELL program to monitor that all the ELL students are receiving the mandated number of 
minutes of instruction. Beginner/Entering and Low Intermediate/Emerging students receive 360 minutes a week of ENL 
instruction by a certified ENL teacher, 180 of those minutes in standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL. 
Intermediate/Transitioning students receive 180 minutes a week of ENL instruction by a certified ENL teacher, 90 of these 
minutes are standalone ENL and 90 are integrated ENL. Advanced/Expanding students receive 180 minutes a week of ENL 
instruction by a certified ENL teacher, 180 of these minutes will be integrated ENL. Proficient/Commanding students receive 90 
minutes a week of ENL instruction by a certified ENL teacher; these minutes are integrated ENL. These services for 
Proficient/Commanding students will be given for 2 years after the student has reached the proficient/commanding level. 
  
STARS has also made it very easy to monitor that all students are receiving the mandated number of minutes according to 
their proficiency levels. Once the students are programmed in STARS, it is easy to run the ELL Data report to ensure that all 
students are appropriately programmed. The principal sends these reports to the ENL teacher each month to ensure that any 
new admits have been properly inputted and are receiving proper services according to the mandates. 
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 Content is delivered through thematic units within the ENL program during the pull-out groups. Content area subjects are 
taught in English, utilizing ENL strategies. Students are provided with Common Core Standard based Balanced Literacy 
instruction. The ELL teacher pushes in to reading periods (in grades K, 1, 2) using a variety of strategies to help scaffold 
instruction which is delivered in English. Such strategies include front loading vocabulary, incorporating picture support, 
shared reading, turn and talk,  deconstructing academic language, leading small group instruction (guided reading/strategy 
groups), accountable talk (Socratic Seminars), and higher order thinking questions. Native language is provided when available 
through bilingual books and bilingual dictionaries. A Reading Recovery type model is also used with students that are really 
struggling and are far below grade level. Many of the units are teacher created, but closely align with the Expeditionary 
Learning Units that are being used in Grades 3-5. In Grades K-2, the teacher also aligns the content that is being taught to the 
content that is used in the Core Knowledge Program. The ENL teacher also used Fundations to help students develop letter-
sound knowledge, Words Their Way to help students develop word relationships, and Great Books materials are infused to 
help facilitate Socratic Seminar Discussions. In each program model, the students are encouraged to have rich discussions with 
each other. Guided reading and strategy groups exist in all models of instruction (Leveled Literacy books, Scholastic Books, 
etc.) are used when meeting with groups.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Newly enrolled ELLs who speak Spanish at home are tested using the Spanish LAB.  The ELL teachers use translators to assist 
in accurately administering the exam. If there is ever a questions of an ELL’s special needs, a bilingual evaluation is conducted.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

The ELL teacher differentiates instruction to meet the needs of all ELL subgroups: 
a. P.S. 26 does not currently have any SIFE students. In the event that we do, we will make every effort to find the gaps that 
they have in their education and we will build upon what they know to try and help them gain the knowledge that they need. 
SIFE students will be placed in a general education classroom. These students will be partnered up with another student, 
hopefully one that speaks the same native language. SIFE students will also be encouraged to use materials in their native 
language when available. SIFE students will receive additional support in the form of small group instruction and one-on-one 
support. 
b. ELLs that have been in the US less than three years are placed in a general education classroom, where they receive 
additional support from the ENL teacher. When available we try to pair these students with other students that also speak the 
same language. The ELL newcomers are engaged in small group instruction to learn a strategy. For some newcomers, a 
Reading Recovery model is being implemented. In addition, students participate in workshop-model lessons based on the 
Common Core Standards. These students use technology throughout the day, including the use of laptops, IPads, Smartboards, 
and other web-based subscriptions (BrainPop, etc.). These children are also invited to stay for extended day and are 
encouraged (in grades 3-5) to stay for after school test preparation programs to help these students learn test-taking 
strategies.  
c. Students who have been receiving services for 4 to 6 years receive their mandated minutes and work in small groups; we 
use data to find what the student’s specific needs are and target these areas in the ENL program or in any other small group 
instruction. If necessary we evaluate the needs of these students through the PPT team and offer them many of the 
interventions that are also being offered to our at risk population. We have determined that there needs to be a focus on 
reading and writing with this targeted population. Running records are conducted to document student progress.  
d. We currently only have 1 long term ELL (who has been receiving services for 6 years). Data is used to find specific deficient 
skills. This student will receive small group instruction, which will make use of strategies that will benefit the student’s specific 
learning styles (Visual and tactile approaches). Scaffolding techniques and graphic organizers will be used to help the student 
complete academic tasks.  
e.  Support is provided for former ELLs. The ELL teacher meets with the classroom teacher to discuss and monitor the student’s 
progress. The ESL teacher still meets with the students a few times a week (90 minutes of integrated ENL) to support the 
student and ensure that the student is still making progress and transferring any skills and strategies taught to the regular 
classroom.  Former ELLs are included in the list of students (grades 3-5) for test modifications and accommodations. These 
testing accommodations are granted for 2 years after the students pass the NYSESLAT. Former ELLs are often called upon to 
assist newcomers in daily routines and activities.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELL students who have been identified as having special needs are placed on a special targeted list with the PPT team. Their 
general education progress can be monitored and addressed with various intervention strategies where necessary.  ELL 
teachers of students with disabilities have access to and utilize grade level common core standards and common core 
curriculum in order to provide the students with academic content on their grade level.  They provide this instruction by 
differentiaiting and scaffolding grade level lessons .  The ELL teacher also utilizes ELL techniques and strategies such as front 
loading vocabulary, visual and tactile lessons, role-playing, realia, technology, and deconstructing language to accelerate 
English language development. 
        
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our school uses scheduling flexibility for ELL-SWDs within the the ENL program.  These students are grouped with general 
education students during pull-out ENL groups.  Our school uses a variety of curricular and instructional accommodations to 
meet the needs of our ELL students with disabilities.  For example, we utilize an array of tactile and visual techniques to 
differentiate instruction.  Technology in terms of laptops, web based subscriptions, and smartboards are used to appeal to the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

different learning styles and facilitate their learning. We are also beginning a pilot program with Google Classroom to explore 
how technology can give access to ELL-SWDs and help them achieve their goals. Almost all of our ELLs-SWDs are placed in ICT 
classes. These students will receive small group instruction in math and ELA, as required by their IEPs.       
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our targeted intervention programs in ELA include, Wilson’s Fundations, Fountas and Pinnell’s Leveled Literacy Intervention 
System, and a Reading Recovery- based model. Wilson’s Fundations is used in the classroom as a Tier I intervention and in 
small group instruction as a Tier II intervention. Fundations helps build a student’s knowledge of phonemic and phonological 
awareness. Fountas and Pinnell’s Leveled Literacy Intervention System is used in small group instruction as a Tier II 
intervention. This intervention targets students who are below level in reading. Most students are having difficulty decoding 
texts; it helps increase the student’s fluency and helps build a student’s confidence in their reading ability. The Reading 
Recovery-model targets students who are far below standard in reading. These students receive individual (1:1) instruction or 
small group instruction (group no larger than 3 students). This model targets students who struggle with all areas of reading, 
including fluency, decoding, and comprehension. For math intervention, small group instruction is provided for ELLs who are 
below grade level in math.  This model is a push-in model; students use manipulatives and visual representations to gain an 
understanding of the concept being taught.  
Currently we are not offering these intervention services in other languages. We are building up our bilingual library so that 
such services can be offered to students in Spanish.  
Most of our targeted intervention services are offered for grades K-2 because we believe that a solid foundation is essential for 
students to continue to have success in their school careers.       
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    
We plan on continuing some of our current programs for the upcoming school year.  We will continue implementing 
the Fundations Programs in grades K-2.   We will continue using Eureka Math (EngageNY). Also, we will be having Socratic 
Seminars, which will help our students improve their listening and speaking skills. We are also continuing  to use Thinking 
Maps. We started a journey with the Superintendent and have received Professional Learning from The Core Collaborative; we 
will be implementing success criteria and will be working on creating learning progressions for every grade and standard. This 
year we will become a Teacher's College Project School and will be using the Units of Study for Reading and Writing.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs or services will be discontinued at this time. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are invited to participate in all school programs. The ELLs are involved in all supplemental programs, whether it be chorus 
or learning to play the recorder. We also have a theatre club, which meets after school (run by the Sundog Theater Company) 
and many of our ELLs are involved. ELLs are invited and encouraged to participate in such programs by their teachers. Flyers 
are sent to parents in their preferred language when available; if students show interest in the programs that are available, a 
teacher may explain to the parents what the programs are abaout (using a translator if needed). ELLs fully participate in each 
program. For example, in the theatre club, some students become the actors in a play; many of our actors are ELLs and they 
get up in front of the school and act out their assigned roles/lines. If they need extra assistance, the ENL teacher offers her 
services to practice with these students. Our Kindergarten class also puts on a show during graduation, and all students are 
involved in the show (reciting a letter of the alphabet and a line to go along with it). ELLs are given at least one letter and one 
line to recite.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Web based subscriptions are used to support ELLs and supplement the curriculum for ELLs. We use Brainpop.com and 
Starfall.com. We also use Reading A to Z to get additional guided reading books for our students. We use the Leveled Literacy 
Library to provide focused intervention and guided reading strategies. Within classrooms, students have access to e-books 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

(MyOn), laptops, IPads, Nooks, Smartboards, etc. These tools are used to supplement lessons with pictures, videos, books, and 
other activities. We also have a lending library, which has bilingual books and bilingual dictionaries. Many of the materials that 
we are using this year, including Eureka Math/Supplemental Math in Focus materials and the IRLA (Independent Reading Level 
Assessment) have materials that are translated into Spanish, which can be sent home for parents to use with their children.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

We currently have an ENL program. We do not have a large enough population to have a TBE or dual language program yet, 
but we still provide native language support in a few different ways. We have bilingual books, glossaries, and dictionaries 
available in the ENL library. We also have multicultural books available. During the year, we have a unit on multicultural tales 
and stories. We also try to make use of cognates with our students. Students are also partnered with another student who 
speaks the same language. These students can work together, one student translating when necessary to help the other 
understand the task. Correspondence with parents in provided in their native language as much as possible. Translated 
materials are sent home (from Fundations, IRLA, Math in Focus, EngageNY, Eureka Math, etc. when available).  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The required services and resources support and correspond to the ELLs’ age and grade. We use materials for the ELLs that 
provide the curriculum and scaffold it to meet their needs. 
 The required services support our ELLs’ ages and grade levels because students are grouped with students no more than two 
years above or below their grade level.  
Resources used correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  Students read leveled books which are age appropriate and no 
more than one year below their grade level. Services for ELLs-SWDs are adapted to meet the age and grade of these students, 
yet are still meeting their cognitive needs. The content is still the same, but the delivery of the content may be enhanced for 
ELL-SWDs. For example, we may use more visual supports, text sets that are on their lexile levels (NewsELA has some great 
resources available), etc.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school does not currently share a building. All materials are located in our school building. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ELL students are introduced to the ELL teachers before beginning their school year.  The ELL teachers help the 
new students find a classmate that can help them get acclimated with their new class. The ELL teacher tries to partner 
students together that can help by speaking to each other in their home language. The ENL teacher and/or parent coordinator 
will give the new students a tour of the building, showing them where essential spots are (bathroom, cafeteria, auditorium, 
classroom, etc.). We use the Leader in Me Program so the classroom teachers also help newly enrolled students get acclimated 
by having a class meeting, where the students can welcome, greet, and introduce themselves to the new students.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Our school does not currently offer language electives. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We do not currently have a dual language program.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 The ELL teachers have numerous opportunities for professional development.  They attend meetings at the district office led 
by the ELL compliance specialist and/or an instructional specialist.  In addition, the teachers attend workshops sponsored by 
the United Federation of Teachers and Teacher Center. All teachers have been involved in professional development on using 
“juicy words” and deconstruction of academic language in their classrooms.  
The ELL teachers turnkey the professional development during a series of teacher workshops held after school , during lunch 
and learn sessions, and during student non-attendance days.  Assistant Principals, common branches teachers, 
paraprofessionals, ENL teachers, guidance counselors, special education teachers, secretaries, speech teachers, all therapists 
(physical, occupational, etc.), and parent coordinators are all invited to attend.  
Every Monday during professional learning time (2:35-3:55pm) all teachers receive professional development; this year our 
main focus is developing progressions, using success criteria, using appropriate language with students to foster a growth 
mindset, and creating tasks that are appropriate and differentiated based on student need and level. We have been addressing 
the needs of ELLs during these meetings by making sure that there are entry points for ELLs and there are success criteria 
included for our ELLs to help them feel successful and to help foster a growth mindset, where we focus on progress and not 
solely a product. 
 
We have a Teacher Center Coach at our school so she is also able to develop and deliver appropriate professional learning 
opportunities. Our Teacher Center Coach and ENL teacher will be attending a professional learning series this summer and will 
be responsible for turn keying this information to our staff and to others in the district.   
All Professional Learning Opportunities have not been schedules yet, but the list so far includes: 
July 2017 - ENL InstituteAugust 2017 - What’s Different About Teaching ELLs? 
September - Impact TeamsNovember 3, 2017 - Task Creation 
April - ELL Conference (UFT Teacher Center)June 9, 2018June 14, 2018*Along with any other relevant ENL Professional 
Learning Opportunities that become available Professional development for teachers in supporting ELLs as they engage in the 
Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) is provided by our Borough Field Support Centers, as well as The Department of 
English Language Learners and Student Support (DELLS). Our school is also offering professional learning this year to teachers 
of ELLs in supporting ELLs as they engage in the CCLS; this ongoing professional learning will include trainings with The Core 
Collaborative, and Thinking Maps. The ELL teachers will also attend professional learning opportunities offered by the UFT, 
Teacher Center, and other various organizations throughout the year.  
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our fifth grade teachers work with ELLs who will be transitioning to intermediate school. Parents, staff, and students are 
invited to the receiving junior high schools to meet the new staff and learn about the programs offered in junior high school. 
The parent coordinator informs the parents when and where the meetings are being offered. In addition, some junior high 
schools host meetings at our school to inform the parents and students about their educational programs at their school. If 
necessary, translation services will be provided. Our school staff is supported by school leadership and the guidance counselor. 
Our school leadership and our guidance counselor offers opportunities for representatives from the middle schools to come 
into our school to talk to the students, teachers, and parents.  
To meet the mandated training for all ELL staff, we will turnkey the information provided at ELL trainings for all teachers during 
our allotted professional learning time on Monday afternoons,  teacher team meetings, grade meetings, or other designated 
PD days. The training sessions will assist teachers in scaffolding and differentiating grade level work for their ELLs. We also 
have built in periods for professional development. Once a week grade K-2 and 3-5 teachers meet with the literacy coach to 
get professional development, including ELL strategies. If the ENL teacher is unable to attend all sessions, the ENL teacher and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

the Coach meet prior to the meeting to ensure that ENL strategies and differentiation techniques for ELLs are included in any 
planning or implementation. The ENL teacher has also made 2 videos that are used to train staff members who teach ELLs. One 
video is on deconstruction of complex texts and one video is on Socratic Seminars (student led discussions). The videos include 
ways to get ENL students involved. Also, the ENL teacher meets with select teachers on an individual basis (especially new 
teachers) once a week to help them integrate ENL strategies into their lessons and to provide PD on certain ENL strategies 
(including juicy word work, discussions techniques, using sentence frames, etc.)  We intend for all staff members to be able to 
incorporate ELL strategies in their teaching. Records are maintained in the ELL Compliance binder, including agendas. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL teacher and classroom teachers will provide individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals, language 
development progress, and development needs in all academic areas, including the four modalities (speaking, reading, writing, 
and listening) and all content areas. These meetings will be scheduled during the parent engagement time allotted on Tuesday 
afternoons. If this is not convenient for the parent, another time will be chosen at the parent's convenience. If the parent is 
not able to come in for a face-to-face meeting, a phone conference will be scheduled. The teachers will use the translation unit 
(phone number), school personnel, and other translation devices to provide any translation or interpretation needs for parents 
during these meetings. Also, any hand outs that are provided will be translated when possible. These meetings will be held in 
addition to other regularly scheduled parent teacher conferences and orientations.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parents are frequently invited to our school. Teachers also invite parents in for parent celebrations, where students are able to 
share their work with their parents and/or other students. Once a month, the PTA holds a PTA meeting; all parents are invited 
to attend. Also, all parents are invited to join the School Leadership Team to get involved in the school community, planning 
events, creating community service projects, and discussing and concerns that parents and teachers may have throughout the 
year. During these meetings, we also hold parent workshops. For example, we hold workshops on the Common Core Learning 
Standards and what is expected from the students based on their grade level. Parent Workshops are scheduled throughout the 
year. The parents enjoy watching their children participate during celebrations and they enjoy working with them during 
parent meetings.    When translators are not available, we have parents who speak other languages who have volunteered to 
help translate for those parents who need that service. We’ve had translators attend the meetings in the past to allow those 
parents who speak another language opportunities to interact more.   In order to determine the needs of ELL parents we meet 
with them during the parent orientation.  We (the ENL teacher and parent Coordinator) speak with parents on their language 
needs.  Parents fill out the student's information cards with their language preference, we also speak with parents to verify 
their language needs.  We discuss the language they would like to be contacted in over the phone as well as in writing. Parents 
are also invited to attend family fun nights at the school (including Bedtime Story Night, Book Fairs, Family Dinner, etc.). This 
year we are also looking to host a multicultural night, where parents could donate a food from their culture, etc.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Laura Kump, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We use the Home Language Information Surveys (HLIS) to gather data about the native language of the students 
and the parents. We also use the blue contact cards to determine the parent's preferred written and oral 
language. Informal parent surveys and conversations with parents in person also help us gather information so 
that we can ensure that they will be provided with appropriate and timely information in a language they can 
understand.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of a school emergency, the over-the-phone interpretation services (Language Line Solutions) would be

set of emergency contact cards (blue bags).  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

All staff members attend a meeting at the beginning of the school year to review the Chancellor’s Regulation A-663, 
with the Parent Coordinator and ENL teacher who will turn key this information; in addition, a notice is given out at 
the beginning of the year to remind all staff of the resources that are available for translation and interpretation. This 
includes providing the over-the-phone translation service number for Language Line Solutions and the phone number 
and e-mail for the Office for Family Engagement and Advocacy Translation and Interpretation Unit. If any new staff 
are hired during the year, the Language Access Coordinator and the English as a New Language Teacher will provide 
basic training to ensure that they are also made aware of these chancellor’s regulations. If any staff members have 
questions regarding the Chancellor’s Regulations or the resources that are available to meet compliance, they are 
encouraged to seek out the Language Access Coordinator or English as a New Language Teacher. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Our school will make sure that limited-English Proficient parents are aware of their right to receive information by 
using the signage and posters provided by the translation unit. We will provide language request cards for parents to 
keep in their wallet; these cards will state the language in which they would like assistance. This will ensure that they 
know they can receive information in their preferred language by presenting the card to school staff.

Our school will fulfill Section VII of Chancellor's Regulations A-663. We work hard to ensure that translation and 
interpretation services are available for parents. We collect data regarding the primary language of the parents by 
looking at HLIS, the blue cards, the Parent Surveys, and through in person communication. We provide translation or 
interpretation services for parents by utilizing our school staff, parent volunteers, or over the phone services provided 
by the Translation and Interpretation Unit. We also make sure that we have copies readily available of the translated 
documents containing critical information, which include but are not limited to registration information, report cards, 
entitlement letters, and other health and safety forms.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school will use the parent surveys to gather feedback from parents regarding the quality and availability of 
services. We will also gather feedback during parent meetings and through informal school-made surveys and 
feedback forms given to parents after parent meetings and workshops. Our school has a private Google Community 
and a new website, which could be used to gather data on language requests and could offer links to surveys to have 
parents offer feedback on how to improve language services.
