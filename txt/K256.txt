Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

My vision vision is to create a solid foundation for lifelong learning.  

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Our mission is to collaboratively work together to achieve positive outcomes for the growth and success of all

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

We are a District 13 Elementary school located in the heart of Bedford Stuyvesant. We service school age children 
Pre-K to grade 5, predominantly of African – American and Hispanic descent. We are a balanced literacy school 
partnered with Columbia University, Teachers’ College. We are also implementing science based learning through 
several partnerships (M.A.D Science, New York City Hall of Science, Vision Education & Media-Robofun, New York 
University/PolyTech Robotics, the New York Historical Society, Studio In A School art program, and Sports and Arts ( 
New York Edge) after school program. 

 

We nurture the whole child socially, emotionally and academically. We focus on the growth of each child and teach 
children to care and promote building community. We offer students Spanish as a foreign language, and we have a 
state of the art science lab that allows students to experience science at a deeper level with a lot of hands 
experiences. We also offer students various learning experiences through high technology. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our special needs students in grades 3, 4, and 5 can use more direct and focus instruction on the individuals specific 
needs. This might include extended day instruction. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our school made the most progress with rigorous instruction for literacy in grades 3 through 5. Our challenges are 
rigorous instruction in science and social studies and in balanced Literacy school wide.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Our preliminary New York State Common Core 2018 English Language Arts scores for grades (3,4,5) indicate that our 
New York State Common Core 2018 English Language Arts scores for all grades (3, 4, 5) indicated that 50% of all 
students tested met proficiency by scoring at level 3 and 4. This data reflects an upward trend of 15% when compared 
to the NYS 2017 ELA scores for all grades.  

Our preliminary New York State Common Core 2018 Mathematics scores for grades (3,4,5) indicate that our New York 
State Common Core 2018 Mathematics scores for all grades (3, 4, 5) indicated that 46.2% of all students tested met 
proficiency by scoring at level 3 and 4. This data reflects an upward trend of 9.1% when compared to the NYS 2017 
math scores for all grades.  

As stated in our 2017-2018 Quality Review and the 2018 PPO, we need to continue developing teachers in 
Assessment-Based Instruction, Collaborative Team Teaching, and begin to study the new Standard based instruction 
in Science and Social Studies.Monitor teacher practice in the components of Balanced Literacy as a result of 
observations and discussions during 2017 - 2018 school year.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019 all teachers will utilize assessment-based instruction in all content areas, standard based curricula in all 
content areas, rigorous and cognitively engaging tasks that will meet the needs of all students in all content areas 
resulting in an increase of 10% on the New York State assessments.

their instruction for various purposes, such as, an entry point 
for launching a unit of study, re-teaching, small group work, 
differentiation of materials, etc. 

Administration will collect and analyze results of grade level 
pre- and post-assessments for reading and math units of study 
to monitor student progress. 

Teachers will indicate in their Reading, Writing, Math, Science, 
and Social Studies lesson plans adjustments to their instruction 
based on informal and formal assessments (Teacher anecdotals, 
teacher observations, conference notes, pre- & post unit 
assessments, students on demand writing samples, homework, 
classwork, etc.) 

Administrators will monitor and analyze teachers’ lesson plans 
in all content areas to note adjustments to instruction based on 
student data collected by the teacher from formal and informal 
assessments. (Teacher anecdotals, teacher observations,

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 13K256, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Benjamin Banneker will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

13K256, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 Our school uses Teacher's college Reading and Writing Assessment as a tool to drive instruction. Three times a year we do 
a  running record where we assess for reading comprehension and fluency. We utilize NYC Benchmark assessments ( Periodic 
Assessments and Performance Assessment).  We also have a writing assessment on both narrative and non-fiction writing 
where we assess grammar, descriptive language, vocabulary and form. these results give the teachers insight as to how they 
target their lessons and grouping.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

When most ELLs in the program make gains in the NYSESLAT by advacing to the next level or testing out of the ESL program by 
scoring proficient in the NYSESLAT. Also when ELLs score high 2's, 3's or 4's on ELA and/ or  math exams we feel that the 
program is successful. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
When our students are assessed and are in need of intervention we develop a small group intruction model to supplemment 
their needs for a determined period of time and assess them again to look for progress and evaluate if intervention works or if 
not we proceed  to the next tier.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Our Students perform better in listening and speaking. They are approching standards in reading while struggling with 
the  writing component. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

We use a combined push-in and pull-out model to ensure maximum efficiency and to comply with the mandated 
minutes required for each language proficiency level. We place students heterogeniously  in each class.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              As specified under CR Part 154, all our beginning and intermediate level English Language Learners receive 
360 minutes of ESL instruction per week. Our advanced students receive the prescribed 180 minutes per week. The students 
that test out receive 90 minutes of support in their classroom per week. They also get extended time in their city wide 
assessments for two years after they test out. 
  
  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                We are aware that any group of learners will be made up of students who are at different stages in their language 
acquisition and cognitive development; therefore we strive to provide instruction in such a way that addresses the needs of 
each ELL subgroup. 
        Newcomers at our school are serviced with the intention of giving them the language skills they need to function 
successfully in their new country, community, and school.  They are placed with English-speaking peers in an age appropriate 
environment in order to present them with language acquisition opportunities and extrinsic motivation as well as support 
from their peers.  Since many newcomers arrive with little or no English in any of the four language skill areas, our newcomers 
receive ESL services that are intended to provide both content area and second language instruction with  the intent of 
developing both BICS (Basic Interpersonal Communication  Skills) and CALP (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency). 
Literacy and language development take place through student participation in the teachers college writing and reading 
workshop as well as more specialized instruction from their ESL teacher.  The ESL and classroom teachers work together to 
make content area and language instruction accessible to students by employing sheltered English and a wide range of 
scaffolding techniques.  In addition to these supports newcomers also receive extra attention through our after school 
programs, access to literacy technology (computer programs, recorded books, internet, etc), and additional academic 
intervention if needed. 
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                We have staff in our building who periodically question the children in their native language for comprehension of 
topics being taught and report findings back to the classroom teacher so they can plan according to the findings.  
  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

. SIFE students are taught the foundations of the English language in conjunction with the content pertaining to their grade. 
We have the Spanish cluster who teaches foundations in Spanish for the Spanish speaking SIFEs.  
                Newcomers at our school are serviced with the intention of giving them the language skills they need to function 
successfully in school.  They are placed with English-speaking peers in an age appropriate environment in order to present 
them with language acquisition opportunities and extrinsic motivation as well as support from their peers.  Since many 
newcomers arrive with little or no English in any of the four language skill areas, our newcomers receive ESL services that are 
intended to provide both content area and second language instruction with  the intent of developing both BICS (Basic 
Interpersonal Communication  Skills) and CALP (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency). Literacy and language development 
take place through student participation in the teachers college writing and reading workshop as well as more specialized 
instruction from their ESL teacher.  The ESL and classroom teachers work together to make content area and language 
instruction accessible to students by employing sheltered English and a wide range of scaffolding techniques.  In addition to 
these supports newcomers also receive extra attention through our after school programs, access to literacy technology 
(computer programs, recorded books, internet, etc), and additional academic intervention if needed. 
We have no long  term ELLs but if we did we would place them in a small group so they can get extra support in the modality 
that they are struggling with until we see improvements.  
  
       As ELLs at our school reach proficiency by passing the NYSESLAT, they continue to receive 90 minutes per week through 
a  push in model in a  content area in order to ensure academic success. they also receive extended time during city wide 
testing. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
At our school all ELLs that have Individualized Education Plans (IEP) are in self-contained classrooms. This population receives 
individualized instruction from their classroom teachers, teacher assistants (in some cases bilingual), and the ESL staff as 
prescribed by their IEP. They also receive sheltered English instruction and various scaffolding techniques that will aide in their 
language and content learning. 
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We have our related service providers piggy back on what the classroom teacher is teaching to enhance our students' learning. 
We also use push-in as much as possible to maintain a balanced atmosphere. We also mainstream children that require more 
rigorous academics. 
  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Teachers use scaffolding techniques in their classrooms to accommodate the ELL population, and cooperative learning through 
math, science and  social studies content areas to build all aspects of language proficiency including reading, writing, listening, 
and speaking.  All teacher are also using small groups to more effectively target their instruction. All instruction is done in 
English.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We will keep all programs being  offered to our ELLs. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

None of our programs will be discontinued.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
The ELL population at PS 256 is given equal access to all programs. They are invited to attend our After School and Saturday 
academy. We offer Intensive Reading and Math instruction during these programs.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
In order to support our Ells in reading and writing we use materials like Finish Line for ELLs , recorded books and websites that 
fosters learning. In addition we employ the help of our technology teacher to teach our students how to utilize technology to 
do research, create web page design and review typing skills and math skills.  . 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is delivered through the use of dictionaries and by grouping students with a bilingual “buddy”.  The 
ESL teacher and paraprofessionals provide support as needed in the student native language. 
The services, support and resources we provide our ELLs at PS 256, matches the student’s age, grade and proficiency levels. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All materials used are age and grade appropriate. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

 

In order to support our Ells in reading and writing we use materials like Finish Line for ELLs , recorded books and websites that 
fosters learning. In addition we employ the help of our technology teacher to teach our students how to utilize technology to 
do research, create web page design and review typing skills and math skills.  . 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We have our SPINS counselor who offers throughout the year all newly enrolled students opportunities to meet key staff and 
students and give them a tour of the school so that they feel like a part of this community. The ENL teacher also offers this 
support to all ELLs. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We offer a Spanish cluster. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
In regards to professional development specifically tailored to ESL teachers, our ESL staff attends many workshops and 
professional developments courses offered by Teacher’s College, the office of English Language Learners and BETAC 
(Bilingual/ESL Education Technical Assistance Center). Professional development is ongoing, after school, and during grade 
conference meetings. These workshops are provided by other teachers who turns key, the assistant principal and principal as 
well as professional consultants throughout the year. These trainings are another opportunity for all teachers to receive 
workshops geared toward the specific needs of our ELL population. Professional development focuses on using Fountas and 
Pinnell Benchmark assessment system to assess all students. This data is then used to map out instructional strategies that are 
geared toward individual, small group, whole class, and differentiated instruction for all English Language Learners. This 
program will also provide systemic supplement of professional development based on proven methods of early detection and 
on English Language Learners intervention and support program.  The ESL teacher offers support and suggestions to classroom 
teachers on a continuous basis.  
The ESL teacher provides classroom teachers ELL training as per jose P. throughout the school year. 
Teachers of ELLs also receive all in-house workshops pertaining to the Common Core Learning Standards and are sent out to 
different ENL worshops to gain new insight and ideas throughout the school year. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The guidance councelor in conjunction with the SPINS councelor push into the senior classes throughout the year to explain 
and guide our ELLs in the middle School Application process and as to what is expected in Middle School.  
The ENL teacher is sent out to ENL workshops and turn key to the rest of the teachers of ELLs in the school. She also provides 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

worshops throughout the year on key language and content support ideas. These workshops are on an ongoing basis 
throughout the year. They are recorded through agendas given at time of workshop.   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Teachers of Ells in conjunction with ENL teacher have periodic meetings during parent engagement Tuesdays throughout the 
school year to discuss ELLs progress and recommendations. ENL teacher does translations in Spanish. If we need to translate 
another language we call the interpretation unit. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

The school offers ongoing workshops for parents on how to help their children achieve succes. Our  parent 
coordinator  organizes and reaches out to all parents to participate in various events. Ex. ELA, MATH, Work shops. We also 
have Literacy night, Father and son night, etc.  We survey our parents on their  needs  and based on the majority of responses 
we offer help or outreach.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Sharyn Hemphill, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In order to assess our school's written translation and oral interpretation needs and ensure that all parents are 
provided with appropriate and timely information in a language they can understand, we used classroom surveys. 
Classroom surveys gives us an idea of languages spoken, written and read in student's homes. We sent a survey 
home to each of our students inquiring as to whether or not the parent or guardian needed translation services 
for notices sent home.We also took an inventory of the HLIS for the ELLs in our program and an overview of the 
OTELE report for our school. We also used Students Emergency contact cards. We then tabulated the number of 
parents that spoke languages other than English and determined that there was a need for translation of notices 
and information about a child's academic performance, ways to increase student achievement and enhance the 
parents' understanding of academic standards, assessments and tests. We also provide information on parent 
communication needs for the Language allocation Plan for the school. The parent team and ESL Teacher confer 
with the parents by telephone, or on a one to one conferences about their individual needs.
