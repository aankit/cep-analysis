Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The dedicated staff at PS45 is deeply involved in furthering their instructional practices and continuing their own 
learning, which in turn provides a real life model for our students to do the same. Student learning experiences 
emphasize literacy, numeracy and higher-order thinking skills. Through the combined efforts of the home, school 
and community, each child unleashes his/her potential and develops a lifelong love of learning. Together, we

empower students to take responsibility for their own learning. Collaboration, SOARing and Believing leads to 
achievement and success. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S. 45R is a Title I school located in the heart of West Brighton on the North Shore of Staten Island. We are a diverse 
student population of 878 students: 47% Hispanic, 27% White, 16% Black, Asian 6% Multiracial 3%. 62% of our 
students qualify for free lunch and approximately 24% of our students are Students With Disabilities and 6% English 
Language Learners. The dedicated faculty at PS 45 is deeply involved in furthering their instructional practices and 
continuing their own learning, which in turn, will provide a real-life model for students to do the same. 

Each year, PS45 analyzes student data and teacher pedagogy trends to develop 3 public facing school goals. These 
goals align to the NYC DOE Framework for Great Schools.  

School Goal #1: We will use the three feedback questions to enhance our learning: What am I learning?  
How am I learning it? Why am I learning it? 

School Goal #2: I will take ownership of my learning through the use of self and peer assessment.  

School Goal #3: We will engage in authentic dialogue to share thoughts, feelings, insights, and concerns in a 
supportive atmosphere in order to listen to and understand each other without judgment. 

To fulfill Goal # 1 and 2, we have partnered with The Teachers College Reading and Writing Project. In analyzing our 
running record data, this partnership will focus on word study and reading behaviors in grades K and 1. For grades 
2-5, on writing with an emphasis on focus and stamina. Another partnership we have is with Core Collaborative. 
This partnership focuses on pedagogical protocols, specifically the lesson study protocol to plan Number Talks. in 
grades K-2. Through the support of the district, grades 3-5 is working with National Teaching Network to support 
mathematics instruction to gain a deeper understanding of the Standards of Mathematical Practice 1, 3 and 6, and 
on ensuring that all components of rigor are included while teaching each standard.  

To enhance school goal #1, we will be using the three feedback questions with our Marquis Studios partnership 
through the following residencies. Dual Language through Song, Circus Arts, Puppetry, Poetry, African Marketplace, 
Musical History Beats of the Western Hemisphere.  

To enhance school goal #2, we also partnered with Chess in the Schools provide students more opportunities for 
students to be able to self and peer assess by checking ideas and suggesting alternatives. 

In order to fulfill goal #3, P.S. 45 has partnered with the Professional Learning Collaborative (PLC) The PLC, in 
conjunction with the United Federation of Teachers and the NYC Department of Education, provides ongoing 
workshops in restorative practices and social emotional learning. The goal is to support positive relationships that 
enable students to learn. The parent component includes developing a parent charter and engage parents in 
community circle conversations to make sure all voices and perspectives are heard.  

Through the Learning Partner Program with PS5 and PS57, we have established a Vision of Racial Equity for teacher 
collaboration in the area of mathematics. It is as follows: 

Math is a cognitively challenging area that requires students to individually comprehend and analyze what steps 
need to be taken. Teachers create tasks that are racially and culturally relatable. Teachers help all students achieve 
by planning multiple entry points into the material so that students can reach their full potential. As a result of 
these practices, students feel that teachers know and understand them as people and as readers, and that

knowledge guides instructional decisions. Students feel their cultures, values and experiences are reflected and 
celebrated in their Math classrooms. Students are able to articulate their thoughts and question each other's 
thinking in productive ways. All students are fully engaged in a rigorous learning experience. 

Through our partnership with Parent Corps, our Pre-K students and families are engaging in a program around 
social emotional supports to create a safe, nurturing and predictable environment to help every child succeed 

Through the support of District 31, our 4th and 5th grade teachers are learning to Empower 21st Century Learners 
through the use of blended learning.  

We also partner with the NYC DOE Teaching Academy and the College of Staten Island in which we are committed 
to preparing future NYC teachers. Through this rigorous program student teachers are placed on a gradual release 
model to learn all aspects of teaching. 

We utilize Google Drive and our PD Cycle Maps to monitor and align the effectiveness of all partnerships and it's 
impact on staff and students. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have 24% of students who are students with disabilities.  

There are 6% of students who are English Language learners. We have 1 student entering, 4 students emerging, 11 
students transitioning, 30 students expanding and 6 students commanding. We are working specifically on supporting 
our level 4 expanding students for their individual goals of approaching the linguistic demands necessary to 
demonstrate English language proficiency in both small group and classroom settings.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

According to the Framework for Great Schools, we are exceeding target in Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative 
teachers and Supportive Environment and Strong Family-Community Ties. We are meeting target in Effective School 
Leadership and Trust. For the 2018-19 school year, we are working on teacher pedagogy. 

 
For the 2018-19 school year our goals are: 

School Goal #1: We will use the three feedback questions to enhance our learning: What am I learning?  
How am I learning it? Why am I learning it? 

School Goal #2: I will take ownership of my learning through the use of self and peer assessment.  

School Goal #3: We will engage in authentic dialogue to share thoughts, feelings, insights, and concerns in a 
supportive atmosphere in order to listen to and understand each other without judgment. 

Intended Outcomes: 

As a result of these goals our teachers will be able to: 

  Utilize the learning progressions of the CCLS as entry points into learning and build fluency and flexibility in 

using the CCLS for planning for teaching and learning. 

  Build upon teaching the characteristics of an assessment capable learner. 


Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
In the 2017-18 School Environment Survey, data show that we are exceeding target in the areas of rigorous 
instruction, collaborative teachers, supportive environment and strong family-community ties. We are meeting target 
in effective school leadership and trust. We will continue to work on building trust within the school community and 
the broader community through the use of school goal number 3.  

Over the last three years at PS 45, our students have shown positive growth in acquiring literacy skills in grades Pre-K-
3rd Grade. This is the result of putting in place a rigorous ELA curriculum framework with the Teacher's College 
Reading and Writing Program. This framework enabled teachers to provide whole group, small group, and 
individualized learning experiences for all students. Through this framework, we are able to develop a range of tools, 
strategies, and practices that allowed students to improve their literacy skills in reading and writing. 
 
 Our end of year data for 2017-18 school year, in which the MOSL Teacher's College Reading Assessments were used, 
shows us the following: 
 K: 70% of students are at or above grade level in reading  
 1st: 57% of our students are at or above grade level in reading  
 2nd: 67% of our students are at or above grade level in reading  
 3rd: 58% of our students are at or above grade level in reading  

However, this does not translate to 4 th and 5 th grades. The percentage of students who are at or above grade level 
drops by about 6 % percentage points in 4 th grade with 52% at or above grade level and about 9% in 5 th grade with a 
49% at or above grade level. While 90% of our students make 1 years progress, we need to examine why our ELA 
practice is not meeting the needs of our upper elementary students. In analyzing the data and further analysis of the 
mobility rate 90% of the matched cohort are making consistent, steady progress.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 93% of students will make at least one year's progress as evidenced by TC running records.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
According the 2017-18 NYC School Survey 90% of teachers and parents were satisfied with school culture safety. This 
number was 2 points above the city-wide average for all elementary schools. Additionally, 83% of the teachers felt 
supported to a greater extent or to some extent by the principal. This year we would like to improve in this area so 
that 85% of teachers feel supported by the principal to some extent or to a greater extent. Based on these measures, 
we would like to see growth in the percentage of teachers who feel they work in a supportive, safe environment. This 
would be achieved by addressing the following areas:  

Communication with staff - Involvement of all relevant faculty in discussions about students with academic and/or 
social/emotional learning.  

Communication with students- Consistently utilize the SOAR matrix in all aspects of the school community. This 
includes shared practices and consistent language used by all staff in order to increase effectiveness including the use 
of community and restorative circles 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 

1.  By February 2019, 100% of students will participate in community/restorative circles at least 3 times per 

week in order to engage in authentic dialogue to share thoughts, feelings, insights, and concerns in a 
supportive atmosphere in order to listen to and understand each other without judgment and build trust 
among staff.

staff members as well as staff not previously trained provided by 
the Professional Learning Collaborative. On-going support 
provided by PLC personnel. This ongoing support and 
professional development is provided to encourage open 
communication between teachers and administration in a 
confidential manner. 

School based PLC team to facilitate and address trends and 
cycles identified by SWIS data. This PLC team develops school-
wide incentives that encourage positive behavior which thus 
impacts school culture. School based PLC team members are the 
liaisons between their fellow staff members and administration. 
Staff members can report concerns to the liaisons confidentially. 
These concerns are addressed at bi-monthly PLC Team meetings.

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

In Math student proficiency levels remained flat or decreased in Numbers and Operations- Fractions, and Operations - 
Algebraic thinking. Therefore PS 45's focus standards for Math are Operations - Algebraic Thinking, and Numbers and 
Operations - Fractions. This was especially true when students are asked to apply their knowledge to multi-step 
complex problems.

support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on the feedback provided in the 2015-16 Quality Review an area of need was in 1.2 – Developing teaching 
pedagogy, Across classrooms teaching practices are aligned to the curricula and reflect an articulated set of beliefs 
about how students learn best. Across all classrooms teaching strategies consistently provide multiple entry points 
into the curricula. Teaching practices are informed by the Danielson framework for teacher and the CCLS and engage 
all learners in appropriately challenging tasks. Across all classrooms, students demonstrate higher order thinking skills 
and are encouraged to make connections to real world situations.  

For the 2016-17 school year, teacher engaged in a series of Impact Team meetings designed to identify strengths and 
gaps through a series structured dialogues that allows the group to focus its attention on our school's focus standards 
across all content areas. This allowed for planning towards specific needs of students. 

For the 2017-18 school year, teachers deepened teacher development practices through the expansion of tailored 
professional development that results in enhanced instruction and professional growth. Specific feedback in this area 
was “although measurable school goals are created by school leaders whereby teachers self-select goals are not yet 
connected to improved student pedagogy.” As a response to this feedback, at the beginning of the 2017-18 school 
year, we asked teachers during their Initial Planning Conference to create a student learning goal tied to questioning 
(3b), engagement (3c), or assessment (3d). In turn, administration provided feedback directly tied to the teacher’s 
student learning goal in the subject area observed. The teachers aligned their teacher goals to encourage students to 
think critically, reflect on what they are learning, how they are learning and why they are learning it. They then use 
the impact team protocols during teacher team meetings to evaluate a, analyze and develop a plan of action to 
support all learners and to improve overall achievement including  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By the end of 2018-19 school year 100 percent of our grade-level teams will engage in inquiry protocols using impact

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the 2016-17 NYC School Survey 88% of respondents (87) agree somewhat agree, agree, or strongly agree 
that PS45 offers a wide enough variety of activities and services to help improve life outcomes for my child. The staff 
at PS 45 feels that a wide variety of rich, engaging workshops and residencies are a crucial component to the 
academic and social-emotional well-being of a child and therefore will strive to ensure that all parents feel feel that 
their child and their families have ample opportunities to participate in activities across the school community.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 45R, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

P.S. 45R will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office. 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home

Our Title III after school program provides direct instruction which supplements the mandated 
minutes of ENL instruction students are receiving during the regular school day. This program is 
offered to selected ELL students in grades kindergarten through five. The program will run from 
January 9, 2019 to May 8, 2019 every Wednesday and Thursday. It will begin at 2:45 PM and 
end at 4:45 PM. The instruction for the Title III after school program will be taught by two 
certified ENL teachers. In order to maximize student performance, instruction will be provided 
in flexible groupings. One of the teachers will provide instruction to students in grades K-2 and 
the other will work with students in grades 3-5. Each teacher will group the students according to 
proficiency level and provide differentiated support. 
 
Data from the NYSESLAT, ELA state test and TCRWP reading and writing assessments 
demonstrated a need for this supplemental after school program. 6% of our students 
are English Language Learners. The NYSESLAT/NYSITELL results indicate that 8% of the 
students are performing at the Entering proficiency level, 14% are Emerging, 16% are 
Transitioning, 61% are Expanding. In addition, according to the NYS ELA exam, 52% of 
the tested students scored a 3 or 4, yet 1% of our ELL population who scored a 3 or 4.    
The four modalities of listening, speaking, reading and writing will be included in the 
supplemental instruction. Instruction will be taught in English with language support in Spanish 
if the students are at the entering proficiency level. The supplemental programs that will be 
funded by the Title III allocation and utilized in the after school program will be Imagine 
Learning Software and vocabulary based activities. These programs will be solely used for 
students that participate in the after school program. 
 
We selected these programs because research has shown that after school programs that are 
conducted in the correct way, affect instruction in a positive way. Imagine Learning is an 
engaging language and literacy software program that accelerates English learning.  It is focused 
on oral language, academic vocabulary, instruction in the five essential components of reading, 
and strategic first-language support. This program helps students by utilizing peer modeling, 
providing strategic first language support, boosting oral language development and strengthening 
academic vocabulary. In this program, ELL students are taught vocabulary through videos, 
pictures, glossaries, and direct translations. Words and concepts are repeated in multiple contexts 
in various books and activities, which provide students with a rich language experience and 
deeper understanding. The program highlights both general academic words and content-specific 
vocabulary words, so ELLs can use their new vocabulary across the curriculum throughout the 
day. Additionally, before students read informational leveled texts, key words are clarified and 
defined in the student’s first language.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
In addition, the English Language Learners will be supported through vocabulary based 
activities. Research shows that the natural technique of learning a new language is to build on the 
concept that language is representational of concrete objects and ideas. After using Imagine 
Learning students will use picture and word related activities. Research shows that this is the 
natural way for the newcomers to begin acquire the new language and for the more proficient 
students to increase their academic and content vocabulary. The students in grades K-2 will work 
with the Oxford Picture Dictionary for the Content Areas. This is a vocabulary development 
program designed for students who are learning English. It presents over 1,500 words drawn 
from the content areas of social studies, history, science, and math. It also contains narrative 
readings, rhythmic, catchy chants and written reinforcement activities. All in all, the vocabulary 
based activities are presented in thematically organized topics relevant and amusing to the 
students. The students in grades 3-5 will participate in a unit of study 
which aligns language and literacy skills to social studies standards. 
The students will explore various countries, their histories and cultures. 
Through the exploration of these countries, students will be able to discover 
the diversity that unites us all. The study will include the use of maps, reading comprehension, 
vocabulary and technology related research. All program documentation, such as student records, 
which includes pre and post-assessments, attendance records, program notification in parents' 
preferred languages, dismissal sheets, agendas, handouts, and purchase orders will be kept in a 
secure binder in the ENL room.

Our professional development for Title III teachers includes staff development from Teachers 
College, The Core Collaborative, and Imagine Learning funding for which will not be accessed 
from Title III budget. Staff developers from Teachers College are scheduled to visit the school to 
hold professional development for the staff in the content areas of reading and writing where 
strategies to assist ENL students will also be offered. In addition, professional development from 
Core Collaborative will be used to strengthen the ability of teachers to engage students in 
acquiring the skills and knowledge needed for academic success. Furthermore, staff developers 
from Imagine Learning will offer our teachers professional development on how to implement 
new features of technology program to help support our ELLs during the after-school program. 
This includes the correct use of the assessment part of the program which will be shared with 
classroom teachers and used as a tool for data driven instruction even during school. The ENL 
teachers will also attend professional development workshops offered by our Borough Field 
Support Center which will highlight instructional strategies and best practices for ELLs. 
School based professional development on collaboration and co-teaching will be offered to the 
ENL teachers and classroom teachers who work with ELLs. Professional development will be 
beneficial to the classroom teachers because research shows that those who acquire the necessary 
knowledge are able to perform appropriate assessments to determine the students' linguistic and 
academic needs and measure student learning. It will also assist them in understanding and 
appreciating their students' diverse cultural backgrounds, so they can maximize student

Begin description here:            
 In order to support staff to assist our ELLs as they transition from elementary school to middle 
school, our parent coordinator, our guidance counselor, and our ENL coordinator assist our 
ELLs and their families throughout the process of this transition. They ensure that important 
documents are translated into the students’ home language and provide translators if needed. An 
open door policy is maintained for parents who may have questions or concerns. 
Our school offers many activities for the parents of English Language Learners in order to 
promote academic achievement among ELLs. P.S. 45 has a full service parent center, in which 
families can attend workshops given by our ENL teachers, staff developer, guidance counselor 
and parent coordinator. We utilize our bilingual staff to make content at parent meetings 
accessible to all. We send translated invitations, make home calls and/or invite the families 
personally in order for them to understand the value of their participation to our school events. 
Each month, we invite parents of ELLs to attend our Read Aloud Morning and Math Morning 
(October 2018 - June 2019). These events highlight best practices in our classrooms as well as 
develop an open door policy between our ELL parents and their child's classroom environment. 
Topics for these events are based on student need. Parents are encouraged to play interactive 
math games with their children. These games reinforce mathematical strategies taught in class.

They also encourage interaction between parents and their children during and educational 
activity in the classroom. This is valuable for they will be more likely to participate in a similar 
activity when it is sent home again. During these special days, their visits are followed by ELA 
and math workshops offered by our Staff Developer/AIS provider, and our Data Specialist/AIS 
provider. These workshops will not be funded by the Title III budget. These workshops are based 
on the highlights of each month. With the help of our bilingual staff, parents of general education 
students and those of English Language Learners will learn about practical reading, writing and 
mathematical strategies with which they can assist their children at home.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
  During the 2017-2018 school year, early literacy skills of our ELLs were assessed using parts of TCRWP, Concepts of Print and 
Running Records. For the 2018-2019 school year, early literacy skills of ELLs will be assessed by the use of TCRWP, Concepts of 
Print, Running Records and TCRWP Letter/Sound Recognition. Teachers use data from these assessments to determine where 
student weaknesses lie. Instruction is then targeted to help students improve in these areas. The trends noted on the ELL data 
are that our ELLs need more support with letter sounds, blending of real and nonsense words, vocabulary and spelling. This 
information will help inform the school's instructional plan by providing a framework for what is needed during the word study 
portion of the reading block. Also for differentiation in the classroom, teachers of ELLs will support our K through 2nd grade 
classes by using Fundations and Words Their Way to further develop letter/sound correspondance, vocabulary and spelling. At 
the end of the 2016-2017 school year, as measured by TCRWP IRL, 0 % of our kindergarten ELLs were at or above grade level; 
50 % of our first and second grade ELLs were at or above grade level. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

To support ELL students in grades Kindergarten, I and 2, within the classroom, teachers use the Fundations program, which 
instructs students in phonemic awareness and word study. The use of Fundations contributes to fluency, vocabulary 
development and the applications of strategies for understanding text. Teachers use sight word flash cards and picture/word 
labels throughout the classroom to help ELL students more easily identify objects. AIS intervent services in reading for grades 1 
and 2 is also available for struggling readers. In mathematics, teachers use a standards-based approach for instruction. At PS 
45, we use Launch, Explore, Summarize and provide a balance of lower-level and higher-level demands. Students are 
presented with real-world problem solving, with each grade developing a specific success criteria to guide students through 
problem solving. Teachers use manipulatives, along with daily small group instruction to support all students, including ELLs. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At PS 45, we use formative assessments to identify baselines, progress, and areas of need. Teachers also use summative and 
formative assessments, along with daily work on Moby Max, a computer-based program which is specific to the student. Moby 
Max discovers and resolves missing math skills that are required for math comprehension. The program assesses students with 
a placement exam, provides practice, and continuously monitors student progress in learning and applying math skills. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once data has been reviewed, we use AIS in math to address the needs of struggling students. Reviewing data is an ongoing 
process throughout the school year. In September, we used the 2017 NYS scores on the ELA and Mathematics exams to 
determine which students would receive interventions until December. In December, classroom data from assessments was 
used to determine students receiving AIS interventions in math. Data will continuously be monitored and interventions will 
occur throughout the school year. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
In using data to guide instruction for ELLs within the RtI framework, our school closely monitors students and draws on 
multiple sources of information to identify students who are struggling in the classroom. Data is gathered 
through assessments, observations and student work. We take into consideration the child’s English and home language 
literacy, the number of years the student has received ENL instruction, NYSITELL and NYSESLAT results, teacher and/or parent 
request and student sample work in English and native language, if possible. Parents are notified in writing before supports are 
given. Using the RtI model, our intervention for instructional support is as follows: 
Tier I- in the classroom, the teacher tailors instruction (6-9 weeks): 
• small group 
• one-on-one 
• guided reading 
Tier II- AIS (Academic Intervention services) (6-9weeks): 
• referral for evaluation with the School Assessment Team. 
Teachers are in close contact with parents to keep them well-informed of their child’s progress through telephone 
conversations, using the translation unit as needed, and in face-to-face meetings during parent engagement time and pre-
scheduled conferences 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
  In thinking about and planning for ELL programs, our schools refers to NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, ELA and Math assessment data 
multiple times throughout the school year. RLER and RLAT reports are run monthly by the ENL Teacher/Coordinator to ensure 
all students, including transfers from other schools, are being serviced as per CR-Part 154. In all grades, data is gathered 
through the use of reading benchmarks, pre- and post-writing evaluations, and math assessments. Reading is assessed five 
times within the academic year. Writing assessments are administered every six weeks. Math assessments are conducted 
every one to two weeks, dependent on the unit of study, which general ranges from four to six weeks.

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Here at PS 45, we use cycles that range from six to nine weeks to provide AIS to struggling students. In monitoring progress 
repeatedly throughout the year, we are able to service students based on their academic needs. In doing so, we are then also 
able to track academic progress. In September, we opted to provide service for students scoring a one on the state exam. In 
December, we targeted students who were scoring level 2 on classroom assessments. Throughout the upcoming academic 
months, we will continue to monitor student progress and provide academic interventions to students demonstrating need. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

       
P.S. 45 provides a Free-Standing ENL Program using standalone and integrated models which are implemented in a 
way that will develop our students’ English language skills so that they can succeed in core content areas. As per CR 
Part 154 requirements, we allocate the minutes of instruction according to the students’ English proficiency level: 
Students at the Entering and Emerging levels receive a total of 360 minutes of ENL per week. Transitioning and 
Expanding students receive a total of 180 minutes of ENL per week. Finally, students at the Commanding level receive 
a total of 90 minutes of ENL per week. Our ENL program uses meaningful and 
• targeted instruction and activities 
• pull-out, small group (4-6 students), 30 minutes, 3 times per week 
Tier III- After monitoring progress, noticing lack of response to effective, rigorous interventions: 
purposeful instructions where ELLs explore ideas and concepts at a pace that is reflective of their level of English 
proficiency. They engage in a Balanced Literacy approach that builds their academic, language and cultural 
experiences. The target population is approximately 73 current and former ELL students who are entitled based on 
the established cut-off scores of the NYSITELL or NYSESLAT. Students in the standalone ENL program are grouped 
heterogeneously with mixed proficiency levels and grades. Our newly admitted students in the upper grades are often 
seen for ENL service with students in lower grades to help accelerate basic language and phonetic skills not addressed 
in the upper grade instruction. A class group may consist of two consecutive grade levels with combined proficiency 
levels, i.e. Expanding kindergarten with Entering first grade students.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

         P.S. 45 has two licensed ENL teachers to ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided for our 
students in the ENL standalone/integrated program. One teacher oversees the instruction of students in grades kindergarten, 
first, and second while the other provides for students in grades 3 through 5. Students at the Entering level are serviced eight 
times per week to meet the mandated 360 minutes of ENL instruction. 180 of those minutes are standalone instruction and 
180 minutes are integrated ENL/ELA. Emerging students also receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction. 90 of those minutes are 
standalone instruction, 180 minutes are integrated ENL/ELA, and the remaining 90 minutes are standalone instruction or 
integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area. Transitioning students receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction. 90 minutes 
are dedicated to integrated ENL/ELA instruction and the other 90 minutes are geared towards standalone or integrated ENL 
with ELA or any other content area. Furthermore, Expanding students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or any other 
content area instruction. Finally, students at the Commanding level receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL with ELA or any other 
content area. ELA instruction provided contains ENL methodologies to foster competency in the four modalities of listening, 
speaking, reading and writing. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 Instruction for Entering language learners includes the four skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing and are included in 
daily ELA instruction. Heterogenous, small group instruction includes ENL methodologies in a Balanced Literacy approach 
which consists of independent, shared and guided reading, literacy centers, leveled classroom libraries, literature circles, 
writer’s workshop, interactive read aloud and word study. The ENL teachers provide instruction using the Sheltered English 
approach that engages ELLs above the beginner level in developing grade-level content-area knowledge, academic skills, and 
increased English proficiency. This year, we have also integrated the use of the literacy program, SIPPS (Systematic Instruction 
in Phonological Awareness, Phonics, and Sight Woords) to help struggling readers build skills and confidence to gain reading 
fluency and comprehension. ENL teachers use clear, direct, simple English and a wide range of scaffolding strategies to 
communicate meaningful input in the content area to students. Teachers adapt lesson delivery to suit English proficiency 
levels with learning activities that connect new content to students' prior knowledge, allow collaboration among students, and 
offer ELLs the grade-level content instruction of their English-speaking peers. ELL students are encouraged interact with their 
peers socially and to use critical thinking skills during classroom discussions. Native language support is provided whenever, 
and however possible, to enhance comprehension. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  
Our ENL teacher, Maria Perri, also holds a bilingual extension in Spanish and is able to appropriately evaluate students in their 
native language using the Spanish Lab-R and Fountas & Pinnell’s Sistema de Evaluacion de la Lectura, a comprehensive 
assessment that determines instructional and independent reading levels. Our other 
bilingual teachers are able to conduct informal assessments to our Albanian and Arabic students to determine fluency and 
proficiency in the native language 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

In differentiating instruction for our students, proficiency levels are taken into consideration first. ELLs at the Entering and 
Emerging levels of language proficiency as determined by their NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores will receive 360 minutes of ENL 
instruction per week. ELLs at the Transitioning and Expanding levels will receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week. ELLs 
at the Proficient (Commanding) level will receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL instruction per week. All students will receive 
180 minutes of ELA instruction in their classroom. Content area instruction is provided in English supported by ENL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

methodologies. Differentiation will include the use of language buddies, bilingual dictionaries/glossaries, graphic organizers, 
and instructional scaffolding. The ENL classes consist of: Kindergarten (9 students), Grade 1(5 students, 5 at commanding 
level), Grade 2 (9 students, 7 at commanding level), Grade 3 (9 students, 3 at commanding level), Grade 4 (14 students, 3 at 
commanding level) and Grade 5 (6 students, 3 at commanding level). 
a. There is currently one SIFE student at P.S. 45. Our SIFE student is integrated into the various programs offered here 
including AIS, After School Homework Help, and Language Enrichment After-School Programs. P.S. 45 uses TC Reading and 
Writing Curriculum and Assessments, EnVisions Math, and Social Studies and Science materials aligned to the Common Core 
State Standards to immerse our SIFE student in content area learning. Reading Volunteers are available to struggling readers. 
Before School Test Prep and After-school Language Enrichment Programs ensure our SIFE student is offered additional support 
so she may achieve academic gains. 
b. Newcomer students and students who now require ELA testing after one year will be immersed in programs designed to 
help our ELL population assimilate into the mainstream at P.S.45. Students and parents are invited to orientation workshops, 
international and literacy nights are held, and students are paired with reading buddies to facilitate learning. After proper 
assessment with NYSITELL, TCRWP, and running records (Grades K-5), the ENL and classroom teachers will set up a program to 
support these students with cognitive development and core academic skills. 
c. Students receiving ENL service for 4 to 6 years receive additional support through our Academic Intervention Service in 
reading, writing and mathematics. At the moment, we have 9 students receiving service for 4-6 years, 4 of whom are SWDs. 
Sheltering and scaffolding activities are used to develop academic rigor. 
d. P.S. 45 currently does not have any long-term ELLs. 
e. Former ELLs who have tested Commanding will continue to be supported for the following two years with 90 minutes of 
integrated ENL instruction per week. Currently, we have 21 former ELLs at the commanding level receiving service per CR-Part 
154 mandates. During State exams, former ELLs will continue to receive extended time and small group accommodations. Any 
former ELL who may be struggling in math will be supported in extended day programs. Likewise, any former ELL struggling in 
reading will be supported through AIS. All former ELLs are included and encouraged to participate in all additional programs 
offered at the school. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 At PS 45, all students accelerate learning through the setting of individual goals and the use of success criteria. Our school 
uses Wilson Fundations to assist with decoding delays and Teachers College Reading and Writing Project in our ELA curriculum. 
Instructional strategies include the use of translated printed materials, scaffolding of lessons, graphic organizers with picture 
cues and the use of visual thinking strategies for improved comprehension. Explicit instruction of English vocabulary and 
grammar structures is used to promote language acquisition and a student’s background knowledge is built upon to increase 
comprehension. 
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
All ELL-SWDs receive ENL service according to their NYSITELL/NYSESLAT assessment results. Student IEPs are reviewed by the 
ENL teachers to insure instruction is aligned to individual IEP goals as well. IEP mandates are followed and students in self-
contained environments are never seen in groups larger than their IEP allows. All instruction is differentiated to accommodate 
individual student ability and learning style. Special Education Support Services (SETTS) are provided for students whose IEPs 
have these mandated services in place. Through the use of SETTS, students receive additional support in ELA and Mathematics 
while remaining in the general education classroom setting. All ELL students whose IEP mandates an Integrated Co-Teaching 
environment receive special education support along with their general education peers. 
  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

Current strategies for improving instruction include the implementation of a Balanced Literacy approach which consists of 
independent and paired reading, shared reading, guided reading, literacy centers, leveled classroom libraries, Writer’s 
Workshop, interactive read aloud, word study and teacher/student reading and writing conferences. This approach will 
continue in the 2017-2018, 2018-2019 school years and will continue to be implemented during a 90-minute literacy block. P.S. 
45 has implemented various intervention programs for ELLs: SIPPS, Fundations, Wilson, The Comprehension Toolkit of 
Strategies, Words their Way, Problem Solving and Exemplar Problem Solving. Evidence and research-based instructional 
programs are used to target ELA and Math interventions. Intervention services will be provided for ELA, Math, and Content 
areas for our struggling ELLs in English throughout the year. Data for these programs in grades K-2 is collected monthly; in 
grades 3-5, data is collected quarterly. The ongoing collection of data is used for instructional planning and to provide 
additional intervention and support. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

For the upcoming school year, we have implemented new programs for grades K-5: 
• VocabuLit- teaches Tier 1 and Tier 2 academic vocabulary 
• Daily Language Review- grammar instruction 
• SIPPS- phonics/reading program 
 
PS 45 has also provided teachers with 20 Interactive Promethean Whiteboard Systems in our K-5 classrooms. We have also 
added 195 laptops and 96 MacBooks with computer carts available on each floor for student use. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 
At P.S. 45, all ELL programs and services are being kept in place.    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All our ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs including our Arts Program which is an integral part of our school. 
All ELL students are invited and encouraged to participate in our band and strings. Vocal instruction is embedded into the 
general music instruction. Monthly ELA and Math Parent Meetings are held where ELA and math skills students are being 
taught in class are reviewed. This encourages and permits parents to assist and support their children with homework and test 
study. This year, we will continue our Read Aloud and Math Mornings for parents to attend. All letters are sent home in English 
and the native language inviting parents to participate. Translators are available as well for parents who attend our meetings. 
Using Title III funds, P.S. 45 offers a 15 week after-school program for our current ELLs which meets two times per week. We 
have purchased a technology program, Imagine Learning, to be used in the after-school program to further assist our ELLs in 
grades K-5. This innovative language and literacy software program for ELLs, struggling readers, and our students with 
disabilities, offers first language support in 10 languages. It combines research-based 
curriculum, state-of-the-art technology, and engaging activities and graphics to teach students skills they need to succeed. 
Additionally, all the listed services are available to our ELL population, including students who have reached commanding in 
ENL: 
 
Ø ENL (Extension of Services) 
Ø AIS 
Ø Wilson and Fundations 
Ø After-School Homework Helper 
Ø Before-School Test Prep – Reading and Math 
Ø After-School ENL Language Enrichment (Content Areas 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 
 SIPPS (Systematic Instruction in Phonological Awareness, Phonics, and Sight Woords) is used to help struggling readers build 
skills and confidence to gain reading fluency and comprehension. Instructional materials such as smartboards and computer 
software are used to support ELLs of all proficiency levels. In addition, bilingual glossaries and dictionaries are provided for our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

entering, emerging and transitioning level ELLs. In alignment with our use of the Teacher’s College Reading and Writing 
Project, we have implemented the Words Their Way Program at all grade levels and proficiencies. Our Social Studies 
curriculum is designed to prepare students for college careers, with lessons that are aligned to New York State Learning 
Standards, both Common Core and Social Studies. We use Inquiry Arc as the main instructional methodology where students 
gather, use and interpret evidence. Students participate in collaborative conversations about grade appropriate topics and 
texts with peers, diverse partners, and adults in small and large groups. In Science, teachers utilize FOSS Hands-On Kits in 
grades K-2 and Harcourt Text and Activities in grades 3-5 to supplement the Science Core Curriculum. Through investigations 
and hands-on activites, the emphasis of discovery is placed on younger students and beginner and intermediate level ELLs. For 
older students, as well as expanding and commanding level ELLs, the emphasis is on formulating and investigating their own 
questions. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is delivered in our ENL program through the use of bilingual libraries. We have recently purchased 
bilingual books in Vietnamese, Albanian, Sinhalese, and Chinese to add to our bilingual Spanish books. Newcomers in the 
upper grades are provided with bilingual glossaries in mathematics, science, and social studies. Every effort is made to provide 
all our ELL students with bilingual dictionaries as well. Our mathematics program, EngageNY Math, provides instruction and 
assessment in Spanish to support our native Spanish speakers in grades K through 5. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Consistent with our efforts to improve NYSESLAT scores, additional targeted instruction for ELLs will continue to be provided 
through the various programs listed. These programs are intended to support ELLs in achieving the Common Core Standards. 
All supplies and materials correspond to students’ ages and grade levels. TCRWP is incorporated into all grades, K-5. 
Fundations is used for the lower grades to assure support corresponds to students' age and grade levels. Supplemental 
instructional programs will continue to focus on language and literacy development as well as content area learning. The 
additional instruction will help the children progress toward achievement of rigorous academic standards that all students are 
expected to follow. Any notices about programs and services offered will be sent home to students in their native languages. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Parent Orientations are held for incoming students. An Open House is conducted to familiarize students and parents with the 
layout of the school and our bilingual translators help facilitate the tour. Our parent coordinator, teachers and staff are 
available to meet with parents, answer questions and provide assistance. All materials are translated into various languages for 
parents. Before the start of school, teachers also send home a welcome letter to all new students. The following activities help 
our language learners adapt to their new learning environment: 
PLAN FOR NEWCOMERS 
Ø Parent Orientation/Workshops 
Ø Bilingual notices 
Ø Reading buddies 
Ø Family Literacy Night 
Ø International Night 
New ELL students who are enrolled throughout the school year are immediately partnered with a peer who speaks the same 
language to help the student navigate through the school, provide translation for the teacher if needed, and help in the 
adjustment to a new setting. New students and parents are provided with the school's informational materials (discipline 
codes, newsletters and calendars, workshop notices) in the native language. Parents are also encouraged to use the school's 
website for further information and updates.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Staff Development is coordinated by a team that includes our Principal, Assistant Principals, Grade Leaders and ENL teachers. 
They work together to combine ideas on effective planning for all pedagogical staff. It will focus on the 90-minute literacy 
block (with a focus on guided reading, writing and conferring, Engage Mathematics and Book of the Month). Also, the Fountas 
and Pinnell Phonics Lessons Program will be addressed in after-school study groups. Teachers will plan and work together to 
teach this program efficiently and effectively. In-house professional development is available to all teachers of ELLs and focus 
will be on class environment and strenghtening student work. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Staff developers from Teachers College are scheduled to visit the school to hold professional development for the staff. 
Through Teacher’s College Professional Development, teachers focus on Skills and Strategies to address the needs of ELLs 
throughout the year. Professional Learning sessions will take place every Monday (80 minutes) and Tuesday (35 minutes). 
Working collaboratively, teachers form Impact Teams who review student work and then develop success criteria to build 
successful learners. All records for professional development activites, such as agendas, attendance, notes, will be maintained 
by grade leaders who will in turn provide administration with said documentation. Along with all professional development 
provided in-house, the ENL teachers also attend ENL professional development sessions offered by the Integrated Curriculum 
& Instruction Learning Support Organization. Yearly ENL Workshops include: LAP Training NYSITELL Administration Both ENL 
teachers pursue targeted professional development opportunities that address the needs of ELLs and turnkey all information 
to our staff. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
  
Annual individual meetings will be scheduled for parents of ELLs to discuss language development progress, 
program goals, and language development needs in the content areas. Parents will be made aware of language 
proficiency assessment results and steps being taken to better support students. All meetings will be conducted with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

 

qualified translators and attendance will be recorded. In order to ensure parent needs are accomodated, all 
records of annual individual meetings will be carefully maintained. Written attendance, agendas, documentation of 
all telephone communications and copies of letters will be kept. iLOG on ATS will also be used to documents notes 
of communication. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

  
At P.S. 45, our parents are very much involved in the school community. Parent involvement includes volunteering, 
joining and supporting the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA), and being a part of the School Leadership Team (SLT). 
Both the PTA and the School Leadership Team meet once a month. The PTA assists parents in becoming involved in 
their children’s education and supporting school activities. The SLT determines the structure for school-based 
planning and shared decision making. These school-based organizations are open to all parent and guardians of 
children our school, including parents of English language learners. The PTA ensures that notices go home in the 
native language. 
There will be annual Orientations in September to provide the parents of new English Language Learners any 
information they need on standards, assessments, school expectations and program requirements for bilingual 
education and ENL. At this orientation, parents are introduced to the different programs throughout the Region and 
the ENL program at P.S. 45. We will also use the Learning Environment Survey to evaluate the needs of parents. 
Parent orientation will also be conducted throughout the year, and within the first 10 days of admittance, as new 
ENL students are registered at the school in compliance with State mandates. Our parent coordinator, Sandy Sims, 
will attend all orientations to welcome parents. All materials will be made available in the native languages 
represented at our school. 
In an effort to address the needs of the parents at P.S. 45, we turn to the Learning Environment Surveys to help us 
evaluate how best to assist parents. In response to the survey, two (ELA and Math) three-hour workshops will be 
offered again on a Saturday to help parents and children get acquainted with the ELA and NYS Math exams. Last 
year’s workshops had excellent attendance. Monthly Math Mornings and Parent Read-Aloud Mornings are held 
with translators available for attending parents. At the end of each summer, the needs of parents are reviewed, 
and planning for the school year begins. We also evaluate the needs of our parents through our teachers who are 
most often in direct contact with our parents and there is a continuous effort to make parents of ELLs partners in their 
children’s education. School activities include: Curriculum Conference Monthly Math Morning for Parents Monthly Read Aloud 
Morning for Parents Barnes & Noble Book Fair ELL Annual Individual Meeting International Night Family Literacy Night Family 
Math Night Country Fair 
  
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
             
At P.S. 45, the ENL Program is designed to develop skills in understanding, speaking, reading, writing and 
communicating in English. This is a push-in/pull-out program. Students at the beginning and intermediate levels 
(based on NYSITELL and NYSESLAT) receive 360 minutes of ESL instruction each week. Students at the advanced 
level receive 180 minutes of instruction. In addition the classroom teachers provide 180 minutes of ELA instruction. 
The ESL teachers meet regularly with the classroom teachers during weekly common planning time to integrate the 
general education curriculum with the ENL methodologies. At this time, each child’s strengths and weaknesses are 
addressed. There is a collaborative effort to provide a solid foundation for ENL instruction, curriculum and 
assessment. 
There is collaborative planning in the content areas. Content area instruction is in English based on grade 
appropriate curriculum guides using ESL methodologies. Instructional adaptations are discussed using ESL content 
area instructional materials. 
To supplement the Balanced Literacy Program, the ENL teachers will continue to provide instruction in the New

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Christine Chavez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The data and methodologies used to assess our school’s written translation and interpretation needs includes the 
following:  

• Student Registration Form: helps us determine the language need of the parents 

• Parent Language Surveys: Part III - parents designate the language in which they prefer all written and oral 
correspondence to be handled 

• Home Language Identification Surveys (HLIS): student interview helps assess language needs 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

• The Language Allocation Policy (LAP) Part III ELL Demographics: contains a breakdown of ELLs by grade in each 
language group 

• Parent Orientations 

• Place of Birth ATS report (RPOB) 

• Parent/Student Ethnic Identification Surveys: completed at registration 

• Emergency cards: parents’ language preference is indicated on the card

In order to fulfill Chancellor's Regulations A-663, the school displays signs located at the entrance of the school 
indicating the availability of language services. The school’s Bill of Rights and the Parent Handbook, also translated in 
Spanish, provides procedures for insuring that parents in need of language assistance are accommodated. The 
school's safety plan is reviewed at monthly safety meetings and findings are shared with the School Leadership Team. 
Translations, written and oral, are provided as needed. We will distribute written notification to all parents, whose 
primary language is a language available through the Department of Education, of their rights regarding translation 
and interpretation services. Our bilingual staff members will provide the written translations and interpretation 
services needed to the greatest extent possible. When in-house staff is unable to provide translation services, we will 
request services from the Department of Education's Translation and Interpretation Unit. 

The written translation services our school will provide in corresponding with parents include the following:

Interpretation services will be provided through in-house interpreters on site whenever possible. The over-the-phone 
Translation and Interpretation Unit will be used when interpreters are not available and/or a specific language is 
needed that we are unable to produce translation for at the school. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

In gathering feedback from our limited-English-proficient parents on the language services we are providing, PS 45 will 
use the school survey distributed and collected in May. Information gathered will be reviewed with the School 
Leadership Team members and adjustments, if needed, will be made for the upcoming school year.
