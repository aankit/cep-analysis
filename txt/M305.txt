Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

At The Urban Assembly Academy of Government and Law (AGL), we are striving towards and committed to preparing 
students to gain access to careers that lead to economic and social mobility. In order to ensure that our students gain 
access to careers that lead to economic and social mobility, our goal is to ensure that 100% of AGL students: 

  Achieve their best possible outcome for graduation, i.e., advanced regents diploma, regents diploma 

(especially for students with disabilities), earning college credits while in high school, etc.; 

  Enroll and graduate from college; or 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

  Enter a training program that will lead to an industry credential; or 
  Obtain job placement with an organization/company where students can grow within the organization and be 

financially stable. 

Our plan for achieving our goal includes: 

  Engaging students in a rigorous curriculum that is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and 

Advanced Placement Course Standards; 

  Developing students social and emotionally by giving them opportunities to practice essential core skills 

(effective communication, collaboration/teamwork, critical thinking/problem solving strategies, 
independence and resilience) that will prepare them to be successful in any setting by engaging them in a 
variety of experiences; 

  Offering a variety of in school and out of school extra-curricular activities and ensuring student participation; 

and 

  Building a college and career going culture in which students learn about college and the college application 

process beginning in 9th grade, visit colleges, attend college fairs, parent workshops and exposing students to 
law themed and other career paths through partnerships. 

At AGL, we are planting the seeds for future success. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

As a career and college readiness high school, we are a member of the New York City Department of Education's AP 
for All Initiative. As part of this initiative, all AGL students will take a minimum of three AP courses by the time they 
graduate high school in English Language & Composition, English Literature, and United States History. Over the 
course of the next two years, we will increase our course offerings to include Spanish Language & Composition, 
Environmental Science and Statistics. Engaging students in rigorous college courses in high school will prepare them 
for the demands of college in a supportive environment while earning college credits. 

At AGL, we offer a comprehensive bridge to high school program for our 9th grade students that includes targeted 
academic support, social and emotional support through counseling and academic advisement, and extra curricular 
activities. The intense support that this bridge to high school program provides ensures that every 9th grade student 
receives one on one support that has lead to the majority of our students being successful in their freshmen year of 
high school. 

AGL also has several partnerships with outside organizations that support us in realizing our vision. Our founding 
partner is The Urban Assembly. The Urban Assembly is a non profit organization that provides a variety of supports to 
our school that includes college and post secondary readiness, social and emotional, partnerships, instructional, and 
leadership support. We also have a strong partnership with Henry Street Settlement who provides counseling and 
attendance support for chronically absent students in 9th grade. New to AGL this school year is our partnership with 
the Queen Genuises Program that provides valuable social and emotional support to our young women and Big 
Brothers Big Sisters Inc. Mentor Program that partners 10th grade students with attorneys from a local law firm for 
their remaining three years of high school. 

In addition, we have law themed partnerships with Street Law Inc., major New York City law firms, The Justice 
Resource Center, and the New York County District Attorney's Office. These partnerships provide our students with 
opportunities to learn more about the law field through participating in moot court and mock trial competitions, 
federal court and state court visits, and debate competitions about various topics. These enriching and real life 
experiences help to further develop our students' skills so that they are prepared for the larger world. 

At The Urban Assembly Academy of Government and Law, we are planting the seeds for future success. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have a diverse student population including 19% Students with Learning Disabilities and 4% of our students are 
English Language Learners. Our students with learning disabilities are provided with additional learning supports 
through ICT classes and differentiated instruction. We also have an ESL certified teacher to provide language, writing 
and speaking support for our students who are English Language Learners through targeted push-in services and 
additional writing support.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 
During the 2017-2018 school year, we focused on the following goals: 

1. Rigor in questioning and student discussion that will that will increase as evidenced by a 2% increase in the number 
of students who achieve a 75 or above on the math and English regents exams, from 17% to 19% in math and from 
58% to 60% in English. 

2. The school's learning environment will more effectively support the academic and social and emotional needs of 
our students, as evidenced by a 5% decrease in the number of students who are severely chronically absent and 5% 
increase in the number of students who have 95% attendance.  

3. Teacher collaboration will lead to improved student achievement, as evidence by a 3% increase in average credit 
accumulation for 10th grade students from 78% to 81% and a 10% increase in average credit accumulation for 11th 
grade students from 55% to 65%.  

4. 75% of teacher leaders will have demonstrated growth in their leadership of their teams based on the AGL 
Leadership Framework.  

5. Parent engagement will increase as evidenced by a 20% increase in the number of parents who participate in 
school activities such as parent teacher conferences, and the learning environment survey. 

We were successful in some areas and did not achieve our goals in other areas. While we were able to increase the 
number of students who passed the English Regents Exam from 77% to 89%, only 51% of students achieved a 75% or 
above meeting the college and career readiness metric. We did not achieve our goal in math. In addition, we were 
only able to reduce the number of severely chronically absent students by 1% and maintain the number of students 
with 95% attendance or higher. However, we did increase the number of students with 90% - 94% attendance by 7%.  

In terms of credit accumulation in both 10th and 11th grades, our numbers slightly dropped by 2% (78% to 76%) in 
10th grade and increased 25% in 11th grade (55% to 80%). 

We also made progress in increasing parent engagement with a 8% increase in the number of parents that took the 
learning environment survey from 45% during the 2016-2017 school year to 53% during the 2017-2018 school year. In 
addition, we increased the number of parent meetings the school conducted during the 2017-2018 school year by 
16%.  

During the 2018-2019 school year, we will align our goals with the district and UA/CUNY Affinity's goals by raising 
student achievement to ensure that students are meeting college and career readiness benchmarks. We will continue 
to focus on improving student engagement and achievement in our school community by providing a rigorous 
curriculum, continuing to improve social and emotional supports for our students, and increasing parent engagement.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
AGL has been successful with getting students to accumulate credits, pass regents exams, graduate from high school 
and enroll in college as evidenced by our graduation rates and college enrollment rates. Our four year graduation 
rates for the last six years are: 

2012-2013 - 82% 

2013-2014 – 86% 

2014-2015 - 87% 

2015-2016 - 83% 

2016-2017 - 83% 

2017-2018 - 79% 

The percentage of our graduates that enroll in college within six months of graduation over the last four years are as 
follows: 

2016-2017 - 61% 

2015-2016 - 74% 

2014-2015 - 78% 

2013-2014 - 69%  

Our graduation and college enrollment rates exceed the citywide average, the borough of Manhattan average and the 
overall average for our peer group. The citywide graduation rate is 74% and the graduation rate for our school's peer 
group is 76%. Our current college enrollment within six months of graduation is 3% higher than our peer group and 
4% higher than the city. We will continue to strive to improve our high school graduation rates as well as our college 
enrollment rates.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

While we have been successful with graduating our students from high school and getting them enrolled in college, 
our ultimate goal is to ensure that our students are graduating from college and obtaining employment in careers that 
provide economic and social mobility. We intend to achieve this goal by having at least 75% of our students meet the 
college and career readiness metrics in both English Language Arts and Math to ensure that they are prepared for the 
demands of college and graduate from college. Based on data from the 2017-2018 school year, 35% of our students 
are meeting the college readiness benchmarks in math and 51% are meeting it in English. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, we will increase rigor across all content areas by engaging students in a rigorous curriculum that lays the 
foundation for Advanced Placement courses, as evidenced by a 2% increase in the number of students who achieve a 75 
or above on the math and English regents exams, from 35% to 37% in math and from 51% to 53% in English.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

The English and Social Studies departments will make revisions to 
their curriculum to align with and to prepare students for AP 
courses in English Language & Composition, English Literature 
and US History. The curriculum for each of these departments 
will be vertically aligned across grades so that essential skills for 
successful completion of AP courses will be taught in the earlier 
grades. Departments will receive feedback on curriculum 
revisions and teachers will attend structured summer planning 
sessions to plan first two units of study that align with the new 
curriculum.  

 

Math and science departments will begin the process of 
curriculum revisions in October 2018. The goal is that all content 
area classes in the lower grades will become laying the 
foundation courses for AP courses in 11th and 12th grades. 

Professional development sessions will focus on lesson studies to 
plan for effective student engagement that aligns with the new 
school curriculum, analyzing student work products to monitor 
students' progress towards achieving mastery, classroom inter-
visitations to identify and share best practices but also to 
determine next steps for professional development and 
providing feedback on student engagement in the classroom.  

Teachers will participate in learning walks with school leaders, 
instructional coach and each other to observe model lessons 
where students are intellectually engaged and to observe the 
effective implementation of the revised English and Social 
Studies curriculum. School leaders and instructional coach will 
provide one-on-one coaching sessions to teachers to improve 
practices in these areas. School's professional development plan 
will be adjusted based on sessions to ensure that we are meeting 
the learning needs of our teaching staff. 

Mock AP assessments, mock regents and unit performance 
assessments will be used to measure the impact of implementing 
a new curriculum aligned with the skills needed to achieve 
mastery on the AP exams. Teachers will make adjustments to

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
In September 2018, we will host a family curriculum night to share with parents revisions to our school's program that 
includes all students taking at least 3 AP courses, course expectations, expected learning outcomes, and provide 
parents with support on how they can support their children at home. (Department leaders, college counselor, parent 
coordinator, principal and assistant principal) 

During the 2018-2019 school year, we will continue with the 11th grade graduation conferences that were started 
during the previous school year, and begin 9th grade student led conferences. Parents will have targeted meetings 
with their children to learn about their child's performance and how they can support their child's learning. (Grade 
team leaders, parent coordinator, social work interns/counselor advocates and principal and assistant principal) These 
conferences will also be used as an opportunity for the school to work with parents on how to strategically support 
their child at home to improve performance. 

The school's college counselor will host various workshops throughout the school year that includes opportunities for 
all parents to learn about the college process including what students and parents can do to prepare for college 
beginning in 9th grade, preparing for AP and College Now courses, attending college visits, finding a college that is a 
good fit, parents participating in completing college applications with their child in school and how to pay for college. 
The first workshop will be conducted during the 9th grade New Student Night and the remaining workshops will be 
scheduled during key points throughout the school year.

Part 5 – Progress Monitoring  

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By February 2019, English teachers will have created a complete revised course scope and sequence for all English 
courses for the fall semester that includes completed unit plans with mid-unit and end of unit assessments. Units will 
be designed to intellectually engage students as evidence by a 5% increase in the number of teachers who receive an 
effective rating in Danielson 3c Engaging Students in Learning. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
By February 2019, 40% of students will have demonstrated growth on the mock English Regents and mock AP English 
and US History assessments based on the results of the October 2018 administration of the assessments. 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Since the school’s inception in 2005, AGL has struggled with maintaining high attendance. The school has 
incorporated several programs, systems and structures to increase student attendance. We work very closely with 
Henry Street Settlement, a community based organization that has worked very closely with our severely chronically 
absent and chronically absent students in both 9 th and 10 th grades. Additionally, we have a Student Support Team 
that meets weekly to review attendance data, targets small groups of students to provide supports to students and to 
identify interventions for our students who struggle both academically and socially. 

Research shows that students who have 90% attendance or above earn 10+ credits per school year, are more likely to 
pass regents exams with a 75% or above, are more likely to graduate in four years and enroll in college. Our school 
data has repeatedly confirmed this research. Typically in our 9th grade, students average between 88% and 89% 
attendance as a grade which has resulted in 85% to 90% of 9th grade students earning 10+ credits in any given school 
year.  

Our school will continue to work towards improving student attendance during the 2018-2019 school year. Our 
theory of action is, if we create a learning environment that addresses the social and emotional needs of our students 
and increase student engagement in our school community, then students will want to attend school and interact 
with our school community in a positive manner.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the school's learning environment will more effectively support the social and emotional needs of our 
students through embedding social and emotional themes into our curriculum, connecting students to various 
opportunities and providing attendance support, as evidenced by a 5% decrease in the number of students who are 
severely chronically absent and a 5% increase in the number of students who have 90% or higher attendance.

be assigned to our school's social worker or social work intern 
who will provide weekly counseling, academic advisement and 
attendance support. Grade Teams and the Student Support Team 
will also identify cohorts of students on each grade who have 
unsatisfactory attendance and who are under credited to provide 
academic advisement and attendance support. Students will be 
provided with additional interventions and supports as needed.  

 

The school will continue to use Kinvolve, a computerize 
application, that is used to communicate with parents regarding 
their child's attendance and academic performance. 

 

Grade Teams and the Student Support Team will regularly review 
attendance data during weekly meetings using the Urban 
Assembly Heat Map Tool that provides real time attendance 
data. 

School Culture Committee will continue to support the 
implementation of our Positive Behavior Intervention Supports 
(PBIS) program. We will continue to have quarterly school-wide 
events and activities that will strengthen relationships between

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

After a comprehensive review of our school's data, we noticed the achievement gap between general education 
students and students with disabilities. During the 2017-2018 school year, the school's overall credit accumulation 
average for all students was 77.65%. The average credit accumulation for students with disabilities was 61.11%. We 
noticed the same gap in regents pass rates. The overall English Regents pass rate for all students was 89.05%. The 
pass rate for students with disabilities was 66.67%. For math, the overall pass rate for all students for Algebra I was 
58.82% and for students with disabilities it was 40.74%.  

During the 2018-2019 school year, we will focus on:  

Strengthening ICT partnerships that will result in designing instruction that supports all learners. 
Improving support of ICT partnerships  

 
 
  Monitoring the impact of implementing instructional strategies that support all learners, especially students 

with disabilities.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, effective teacher collaboration will lead to improved student achievement, as evidenced by a 3% increase 
in the average credit accumulation for 10th grade students with disabilities from 66% to 69% and a 2% increase in 
average credit accumulation for 11th grade students with disabilities from 55% to 58%.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

New expectations will be created for ICT partnerships in an effort 
to strengthen co-planning and delivery of instruction in ICT 
classrooms. ICT teaching pairs will receive individualized support 
by having their co-planning meetings observed and receive 
feedback by the school's instructional coach and the special 
education coordinator, observing co-planning meetings between 
the instructional coach and the special education coordinator, 
and through informal classroom observations by the instructional 
coach and special education coordinator.  

The special education department meetings will focus on 
identifying essential skills in each unit that students need to 
master and identify various scaffolds and instructional strategies 
to support students with disabilities to meet course content and 
skill expectations. The department will then measure the impact 
of implementing the specific scaffolds and strategies and monitor 
student progress by looking at student work.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In order to build a school culture that is designed to improve student achievement, there has to be strong school 
leadership that not only includes the principal and the assistant principal, but also teacher leaders. Teacher leaders 
play a very important role in a school because they become the vehicle for embedding effective practices in a school 
community. Building strong teacher leaders has been a multi-year process.  

As we move into year five of this work, we will continue to support the leadership of our teacher teams, however, we 
will heavily focus on the the leadership of our school's instructional coach and the special education coordinator as 
they are leading the instructional work around revising our school's curriculum and strengthening ICT partnerships to 
improve achievement outcomes for all students but especially students with disabilities.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this

and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the school's instructional coach and the special education coordinator will have demonstrated growth in 
their leadership through implementation of an impactful professional development plan that will support ICT 
partnerships and our school's instructional focus around increasing student engagement and agency as evidenced by a 
3% increase in the average credit accumulation for 10th grade students with disabilities from 66% to 69% and a 2% 
increase in average credit accumulation for 11th grade students with disabilities from 55% to 58%.

At AGL, we continue to struggle with parental involvement in our school community. We typically have low 
attendance at parent teacher conferences, in our PTA and low parent participation on the Learning Environment 
Survey . We recognize that this is an area that we need to continue to strive to improve in order to fully realize the 
vision of our school. 

During the 2017-2018 school year, we did demonstrate some growth in this area. We had 53% parent participation in 
the Learning Environment Survey which is the highest in the history of AGL. While this percentage is still fairly low, it is 
an overall increase of 29% from the 2014-2015 school year until now. In addition, we had a 16% increase in the 
number of parent meetings held during the 2017-2018 school year in comparison to the 2016-2017 school year.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 



Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Urban Assembly Academy of Government and Law, in compliance with the 
Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a 
parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the 
School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed 
members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The Urban Assembly Academy of Government and Law will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

●actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

●engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly 
to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

●ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

●support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

●maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

●conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

●provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

●host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

●schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or 
evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

●translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

●conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We use the Degrees of Reading Power Assessment (DRP) to assess the literacy skills of our ELL students.  We administer this 
assessment three times a year in September, December, and May. The assessment in September is used as a baseline 
assessment and the information gathered is used to identify students' reading levels and the results are used to determine the 
literacy skills that we will emphasize in instruction.  This data provides us with insight about the literacy skills of our ELL 
students, which when combined with the NYSELAT and NYSITELL scores, provides us with a more holistic picture of our 
students' skill ability. In addition to the DRP, our students take the NYC English Language Arts Performance Assessment in 
October and in May. The data from these assessments inform the instructional scope and sequence we provide our students 
and supports provided during classroom instruction.  Currently, we provide all 9  th  and 10th grade students with two periods 
of reading and writing instruction each day.  During one of these periods of ELA instruction, our ELLs work with an ESL-certified 
teacher to receive reading and writing support. In addition, all 9  th grade students are utilizing Reading Plus, a web based 
reading intervention program.    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Upon receiving the results of the DRP and NYC English Language Arts Performance Assessments, data implications meetings 
are held to review the data and determine next steps. Typically the data is used to identify grade level appropriate texts, 
student grouping and to determine instructional strategies that teachers will use to support student learning. These meetings 
take place during all staff professional development and during department team meetings.  In December, the DRP is 
administered for a second time to measure the effectiveness of the instructional strategies and support that teachers have 
provided to students. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of our programs for ELL students based on a few key data indicators:  ELL students earning the credits 
they need to be promoted and to graduate, ELLs passing the regents exams they need to graduate, and we also measure the 
effectiveness of our programs based on students' progress on the DRP, NYC English Language Arts Performance Assessments 
and NYSELAT exams.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

As mentioned in question 2, data implication meetings are held three times a year.  The first data meeting is held during our 
annual summer staff retreat, the second one his held in January and a final meeting is held in May/June. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Assessments that we use to evaluate and inform courses that we offer, content that is taught, as well as the supports that our 
students receive during classroom instruction include regents exams, NYSELAT, credit accumulation, the DRP, and NYC English 
Language Performance Assessment.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

As mentioned in question 2, data implication meetings are held three times a year.  The first data meeting is held during our 
annual summer staff retreat, the second one his held in January and a final meeting is held in May/June. 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

ESL instruction is delivered in a push-in model (co-teaching) in ELA classes.   In addition the push-in model, we offer 
ELL students a writing elective course taught by a certified ESL teacher that aligns with our school's writing elective. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

We have an ESL certified teacher who delivers instructional minutes in push-in ELA classes as per CR Part 154 to all of our 
ELLs.  This amounts to 45 minutes per day x 5 days a week.  In addition, students in 9  th   and 10  th   grade receive two 
periods of English instruction totaling 450 minutes per week.    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 At UAAGl we use the workshop model of instruction which ensures that lessons are differentiated for students. For ELLs, the 
workshop model provides a significant amount of time of independent and/or small group work time, during which the ESL 
instructor is able to work with students in small groups to support their language proficiency development.  In addition, we are 
focusing on literacy development school-wide.  Teachers incorporate several literacy strategies that assist all students but 
especially our ELL students with access to grade level complex texts that align with the common core standards.  Some of the 
strategies that teachers in all content areas use are vocabulary rings (each ring contains 4-7 vocabulary words that will be used 
throughout a unit of student that provides the definition of the word, a picture of the word, synonym, and an example of how 
the word is used in a sentence), user guides (Chunks a long text into smaller segments, with guiding questions that help 
students make meaning of the text, definitions are provided for key vocabulary words that may intefer with students making 
meaning of the text, and double entry journals that also chunks a text and teaches students how to annotate the text.  As part 
our literacy focus, teachers incorporate non-fiction and informational texts as well as have students writing for argument 
across all content areas.  While our literacy focus is school wide and is designed to support all students, it also provides ELL 
students with additional support outside of ESL instruction.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Our ESL teacher ensures that native language assessments are provided as necessary for our ELLs and helps to create native 
language assessments as necessary.  For example, when we administer mock Regents exams, we offer ELLs the opportunity to 
take the exam in their native language and then use the results of the exam to determine if the student should take the 
Regents exam in their native language.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

ESL instruction is differentiated for ELLs partly through the classes they are programmed for.  In addition, the ESL teacher 
differentiates her support for the different subgroups of ELLs in the classes that she pushes into. Because our population of 
ELLs in each grade level is very small, the ESL teacher is able to provide targeted instruction for each student she works with.    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
As previously mentioned, at UAAGL, we are currently focusing on literacy as a school.  As part of our initiative, we have 
implemented several literacy strategies to provide students access to complex, grade level texts that align to the expectations 
of the common core standards..  These literacy strategies include vocabulary rings, user guides and double entry 
journals.  Teachers also use DRP scores to provide leveled texts to students in class. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

As a small school, we are able to provide flexible programming for our ELL-SWD so that they achieve their IEP goals and attain 
English proficiency with the least restrictive environment.  Students with IEPs are typically placed in an ICT setting or class that 
has a special education teacher who provides SETTS services.  This ensures that students are receiving the support that they 
need to achieve their IEP goals.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ELLs currently receive primary instruction through their English class.  However, they receive targeted support in other content 
areas, including social studies, math and science through small group tutoring with the ESL teacher.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Currently, we are not considering new programs for the upcoming school year.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Currently, we are not planning to discontinue any ESL services for the upcoming school year.    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs have equal access to all school programs, including after school programs and supplemental services.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All ELL students have access to mobile lab top carts in their classes, SMART board technology and a computer lab. In addition, 
ELL students have access to independent reading libraries which include a range of leveled texts for our students.  Our 9  th 
grade ELL students utilize a web based reading program called Reading Plus three times a week.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is delivered  through the push-in teacher in English classes, as necessary.  Currently, the only program 
model we have is ESL, so native language support is provided through native language assessments and texts as necessary.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required services and support correspond to ELL students' ages and grade levels because that support is provided in grade-
level classes.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
All ELL students have access to mobile lab  top carts in their classes, SMART board technology and a computer lab. In addition, 
ELL students have access to independent libraries which include a range of leveled texts for our students.  Our 9  th grade ELL 
students utilize a web based reading program called Reading Plus three times a week.   As a co-located school, we offer  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
In June and in August, we have a new student night orientation for all of our incoming students.  For incoming 9  th grade 
students, we offer an extended day program that offers literacy support on Mondays, extra-curricular activities on Tuesdays, 
and small group tutoring on Wednesdays that are run by licensed teachers.  We expand this offering as needed to upperclass 
students who are in need of additional support.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish    
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
ELL personnel are expected to attend and participate in school-wide weekly professional development that we have at our 
school that focuses on literacy and assessment practices.  In addition ELL personnel are expected to attend outside 
professional development offered by the DOE.    
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our staff participates in weekly professional development and ESL teachers attend ELL specific professional development 
sessions throughout the school year that focus on ESL strategies, methodologies and compliance. We maintain a binder that 
has the school's professional development plan, agendas and attendance.    
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Each student in our school is assigned a teacher who makes quarterly phone calls to parents to discuss students' academic 
progress, performance and attendance in all content area classes.  Documentation of these phone calls and next steps that 
come from the calls are documented on a Google spreadsheet.  Teachers also schedule meetings during parent teacher 
conferences to discuss students' progress. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
At the Urban Assembly Academy of Government and Law, in compliance with the Title I mandates, has implemented a parent 
involvement policy that is aimed at strengthening the relationship between our school, parents and the community.  We strive 
to involve ALL parents in our school community.  We invite parents to participate in our PTA and SLT.  The parent coordinator 
reaches out to limited English speaking parents to invite them to our meetings and other school activities and often translates 
for parents to include them in our meetings to have their voices heard.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Alison Breedy-Johnson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

When a student is enrolled at UAAGL, the parent coordinator ensures that all parents complete the Home 
Language Indentification Survey either at 9 th grade orientation or when a parent comes to the school to register 
their child. The parent's language preference is identifed and used to provide both written and oral 
communication to parents if translation is requested by the parent.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

We will identify parent translation needs using the home language survey and the parent coordinator will reach out 
directly to parents who may need services but did not indicate it on the home language survey. All pertinent parent 
communication will be translated and there will always be a staff member available for translation for face to face 
meetings.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the
