Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

The student body includes 1% English language learners and 20% special education students 

As a result, the High School of Art and Design provides a range of settings to meet the varied needs of the students. 
Students are placed into the appropriate setting as mandated by their Individualized Education Plan (IEP). Academic 
courses for students with disabilities are organized as either self-contained, Integrated Co-Teaching, or General 
Education with SETSS. The variety of classes ensures that students are programmed into the least restrictive 
environments, which then promote learning, engagement, and growth. Instructional Support Services teachers and 
general education teachers continue to collaborate to implement differentiated instruction to serve all students. 

In addition to these class options, students receive the mandated counseling, speech therapy, and other related 
services as described in their IEPs.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Framework for Great Schools  

As a result of shifts in leadership, the High School of Art and Design is currently an institution in a state of transition. 
This year, teachers and administrators are working on collaborative teams to address students not passing nor 
mastering state assessments due to a deficiency in literary skills. These goals aligned with the school’s instructional 
focus, as defined at the beginning of the school year. The faculty and staff continue to make efforts to increase 
collaboration to ensure that all students receive access to rigorous instruction. 

A. School-Defined Instructional Focus:  

To strengthen literacy skills for all students across all content areas by creating daily lessons that engage students in 
text that is both challenging and accessible and which will require students to discuss and respond to text-dependent 
questions.  

B. Area with Progress: Assessment  

Teachers have a deep understanding of the standards-based curricula, and they, as a result, design assessments and 
performance tasks that measure student growth and learning. After analysis of student work and team meetings, 
teachers are able to design and implement instruction that addresses ongoing student needs in the classroom. 
Teachers provide feedback, both oral and written, that articulates next steps for student growth and improvement. 

C. Area of Focus:  

Collaborative Teachers/Rigorous Instruction 

Through teacher collaboration, school stakeholders are beginning to articulate a set of beliefs about how students 
learn best. Members of the school community need to continue to collaborate to develop these beliefs, especially in 
their relationship to the Danielson Framework for Teaching and instruction. As teacher pedagogy begins to reflect a 
coherent set of beliefs, the needs of all students will be met, thus resulting in school-wide improvements in the 
quality of student discussion and work products.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Findings:  

Problem of Practice 

While the school as a whole has made progress on improved mastery and pass rates in math 
there is still an achievement gap specific to the bottom third and students with disabilities 
compared to other subgroups.  

 
Based on June Regents data, students are struggling with constructed response questions which comprise a majority 
of the percentage points on the exam. Students struggle with these questions due to the literacy component to the 
question. Additionally, based on the cohort data below there is a achievement gap in the college readiness index. 

Supporting Evidence : State report Card; June 2018 Regents Item Analysis; College Readiness Index; NYC Quality 
Snapshot.

Based on June Regents data, students are struggling with constructed response questions which comprise a majority 
of the percentage points on the exam. Students struggle with these questions due to the literacy component to the 
question. 

Based on the June 2017 Algebra I Exam, 41% of the students (127/307) achieved at least 50% of the points in the 
constructed response section; 23% of the IEP students achieved at least 50% of the points in the constructed response 
section (20/88) 

Based on the June 2017 Geometry Exam, 18% of the students (51/283) achieved at least 50% of the points in the 
constructed response section; 4% of the IEP students achieved at least 50% of the points in the constructed response 
section (1/27) 

Based on the June 2017 Algebra II Exam, 11% of the students (22/202) achieved at least 50% of the points in the 
constructed response section; 5% of the IEP students achieved at least 50% of the points in the constructed response 
section (1/21)

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Instruction for Mathematics will be targeted to improve rigor and therefore improve outcomes on Common Core 
Algebra 1 Regents exams. As a result, students with disabilities and those in the bottom third will increase their overall 
college and career readiness index score for the senior cohort in the amount of 5%.

into place a plan to support each student in achieving this goal. 

 

 

 

Every member of the department will infuse Stop and Jots, 
followed by a turn-and-talk to support students unpacking 
complex mathematical word problems requiring them to analyze 
the question, develop a strategy to solve the verbal problem, and 
then verifying the accuracy and reasonableness of his or her

Develop, and assign at least six real-life application performance 
based tasks that require students to analyze a scenario, 
determine the appropriate mathematical tools to apply in the 
scenario, and interpret the results. 

 

Incorporate the use of Deltamath.com for most homework 
assignments. This is a web based program that allows us to 
scaffold topics, differentiate for different student needs and it 
provides students with immediate feedback. In addition, 
embedded within the program is a tutorial for each and every 
problem. Students will be required to also show their work in 
their notebook to serve as evidence that they did in fact do the 
work and to permit teachers to see each students thinking. 
Furthermore, each teacher captures real-time data about 
content understanding by individual, trends and patterns within 
the class and it permits them to also use this data to drive their 
instruction helping to identify areas that must be re-visited. 

 

Grade level-research papers will require each student to obtain, 
represent, and present data to support his or her position 
regarding a specific topic. Similar to the P.B.A.s above, students 
will need to determine specific data sources, method of data 
presentation, as well as interpret their data to support his or her 
claim.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Findings:  

Problem of Practice 

While the school as a whole has made progress on improved mastery and pass rates there is 
still an achievement gap specific to the bottom third and students with disabilities compared 
to other subgroups. 

 
Based on June Regents data, students are struggling with constructed response questions which comprise a majority 
of the percentage points on the exam. Students struggle with these questions due to the literacy component to the 
question. Additionally, based on the cohort data below there is a achievement gap in the college readiness index. 

Supporting Evidence : State report Card; June 2018 Regents Item Analysis; College Readiness Index; NYC Quality 
Snapshot.

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed 
to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other 
high-need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

 

(Student Support) Development and application of a school-
wide instructional literacy focus that supports needs of Black 
and Latino males. 

 

Objective Goal (How will results be measured?): Literacy 
benchmark assessments, regents predictors, and school-wide 
research interdisciplinary projects and argumentative essays. 
Specific focus will be spent on the targeted subgroups; literacy 
based formative and summative assessment showing a 5% 
increase by January and 10% by May for those subgroups. 
Data that will be used will come from benchmark 
assessments, regents predictors, scholarship reports, and 
regents in June. Additionally, a 5 to 10% increase for the 
target group in closing the achievement gap in credit accrual 
for promotion (9th, 10th, and 11th grades) and college and 
career readiness index compared to the overall student 
population. 

 

Build upon the literacy tools developed the previous year; 
Accountable Speaking, Reading, and Writing; Targeted CCLS 
Anchor standards based on College and Career Readiness 
Literacy Skillsets. 

 

Implementation: 

 

  Provide additional strategic reading classes (i.e., 
before, during, after school) or reading/writing 
workshop for students who are struggling with

development tools in their student agenda book. 
(Teachers) Students: a) analyze, apply, & synthesize 
evidence during lessons and summative assessments 
using the accountable speaking and reading; b) 
organize and review the evidence they gathered in 
Part One: Accountable Reading & Talk, construct a 
claim, select specific evidence that supports that claim 
to synthesize (create) their argument, add a 
concluding sentence that ties it all together, and self-
assess their completed argument using the steps in 
Part One: Accountable Reading & Talk. (T-E-A-R: 
Thesis or claim, Evidence, Analysis, and Relate back to 
claim) 

  Continued use of school-wide accountable reading 

annotation strategies. (Teachers)

grade level terms per the Common Core Literacy 
Standards. 
Lesson and Unit Plans will be aligned to anchor 
standards (Teacher teams and Inquiry team will help 
teachers develop these during CPT Mon-Wed and 
Monday PDs) 

  Continued planning and implementation of school-
wide Accountable Speaking, Writing, and Reading 
support tools. (Individual teachers) 

  Development of inter-disciplinary grade-level research 

projects that are argumentative based and grounded 
in CCLS College Readiness Anchor Literacy Standards 
(Fall/Spring). Data specialist will develop eportfolio 
accounts to serve as a repository for major student 
work from classes including the research project; 
grade teams will give feedback during team meetings. 

  The linkage of similar topics, concepts or skills from 

two or more subject areas taught collaboratively with 
another teacher. 

  Vertical teacher teams develop cross-curriculum sub 

objectives within a given curriculum guide. Those 
teams develop enrichment or enhancement activities 
with a cross-curricular focus including. suggestions for 
cross-curricular “contacts” following each objective 
They also develop model lessons that include cross-
curricular activities and assessments. (Mon-Wed; CPT) 
Interdisciplinary curriculum uses essential questions 
to guide exploration across disciplines. 

 

  Teachers develop assessment activities that are cross-
curricular in nature. (Monday PD time and Wednesday 
CPT: led by AP and/or team instructional leader) 

  Professional development will be planned and 

conducted for cabinet and PD committee in August. 
Professional development differentiated based on 
teacher experience and expertise. Additionally, 2/3 of 
all PD will be led by teachers or teams. PD held every 
Monday and on Chancellor Conference days. Data on 
the targeted subgroups will be reviewed after every 
marking period. 

  PD will be conducted in a differentiated way 

throughout the school year based on the needs and 
experience levels of teachers. 

  At end of every marking period, at team meetings, 

teachers peer review curriculum maps and give critical 
feedback. Teachers choose themes/concepts that 
have opportunities for collaboration and deeper 
exploration across curriculum areas. Lessons and 
assignments begin to focus on understanding the

interconnectedness of ideas across academic 
disciplines, rather than fact memorization. 

  Ongoing curricular revision throughout the year 

during one period of CPT a week. 

  Every month teachers will have completed at least 2 

units of study on Atlas Rubicon that are aligned to the 
CCLS and that target the literacy standards. (Mon-Tues 
CPT). Lessons will be more consistently aligned to 
targeted literacy based standards, engagement will be 
evident as measured by the Danielson rubric, Atlas 
Rubicon reports will demonstrate closer alignment 
between targeted/assessed standards. 

  Alignment in English/SS and Math/Science with regard 

 

to themes (content), targeted standards, and 
assessments. 
Students improve their literacy skills based on the 
starting points in the literacy benchmarks given in 
their English classes at the beginning of the school 
year. 

Monitoring: 

 

  Grading and reviewing of inter-disciplinary 

argumentative essays (Fall-2nd and 3rd marking 
period) and inter-disciplinary grade level research 
projects (Spring-3rd marking period); data specialist, 
horizontal teams, APs. Results will be reviewed and 
broken into data where target subgroups are 
analyzed; data specialist, horizontal teams, APs. 

  Peer to peer curricular assessment using school-wide 

unit plan rubric. (horizontal and vertical teams to 
ensure alignment during a Monday PD)

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Findings: Students with disabilities and students in the bottom third comprise a disproportionate amount of the 
students who fail to matriculate the appropriate amount of credits to promote to the next grade level and/or pass 
regents exams. 

Supporting Evidence: ELA Benchmark assessments. June 2018 scholarship reports. January 2018 regents results. 
June regents results. 2018 Summer school enrollment numbers for credits needed to graduate. 

Strengths: There are some students with disabilities who are supported and successfully complete their academic 
requirements. 

Needs: All students need to successfully complete 10 credits in an academic year. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
Develop school-wide instructional strategies that strategically support the needs of students with IEPs and students in 
the bottom third. Students with disabilities will improve at least 5% in pass rates for promotion from one grade to the 
other.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Common planning time (CPT) for Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) 
teachers: 

 

Teachers use CPT to plan units and lessons together and develop 
instructional strategies that include differentiation, 
modifications, scaffolding, and adaptations that target individual 
student needs.  

 

Teachers also determine what team teaching strategies are most 
appropriate for the lesson and class(Team Teaching: Both co-
teachers deliver instruction to the whole group at the same 
time.) The following are team teaching models: 

 

  One Teach, One Observe: While one teacher leads the 
lesson, the co-teacher collects specific data about the 
students, the co-teacher or the environment. 
Station Teaching: Teachers divide content and students. 
Three groups of students rotate through three stations 
in which they work on non-hierarchical activities. 

 

  Parallel Teaching: Two co-teachers teach the same 

content to separate groups simultaneously. 

  Alternate Teaching: One teacher works with the large 

part of the class while the co-teacher works with a 
smaller group. 

  One Teach, One Assist: one teacher leads instruction 
while the co-teacher circulates providing unobtrusive 
help as needed.

Topics chosen during CPT. The interdisciplinary units will focus 
on college and career literacy anchor standards as well as 
overlapping content. The following are the CCLS standards that 
will be targeted: 

 

Reading 

  Cite strong and thorough textual evidence to support 

analysis of what the text says explicitly as well as 
inferences drawn from the text. 

  Determine a central idea of a text, determine the 

meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, 
and analyze its development over the course of the text, 
including how it emerges and is shaped and refined by 
specific details; provide an objective summary of the 
text. 

  Determine an author’s point of view or purpose in a text, 
delineate and evaluate the argument and specific claims 
in a text, assessing whether the reasoning is valid and 
the evidence is relevant and sufficient; identify false 
statements and fallacious reasoning. 

Writing 

 

Introduce precise, knowledgeable claim(s), establish the 
significance of the claim(s), distinguish the claim(s) from 
alternate or opposing claims, and create an organization 
that logically sequences claim(s), counterclaims, reasons, 
and evidence. 

  Write arguments to support claims in an analysis of 

substantive topics or texts, using valid reasoning and 
relevant and sufficient evidence. 

  Gather relevant information from multiple authoritative 

print and digital sources, using advanced searches 
effectively; assess the usefulness of each source in 
answering the research question; integrate information 
into the text selectively to maintain the flow of ideas, 
avoiding plagiarism and following a standard format for 
citation.

Teachers will use this time to provide support to students: 

 

Design teaching aids and lessons that are flexible. 

Assist with homework and classwork assignments. 

Develop easy-to-use monitoring tools that are needs-based. 

Develop a set of resources and interventions that are 
individualized for students. 

Develop or implement a system that allows for easy and 
comprehensive data collection to help monitor and adapt 
lessons. 

 

Promote least restrictive environment (LRE) and higher level 
class scheduling for Students with Disabilities (SWD ) and bottom 
third students. 

 

LRE is part of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act 
(IDEA). IDEA says that children who receive special education 
should learn in the least restrictive environment. This means 
they should spend as much time as possible with peers who do 
not receive special education. 

 

IDEA says two things about LRE that are important to understand 
when working with the IEP team: 

 

The child should be with kids in general education to the 
“maximum extent that is appropriate.” 

ICT classes, or removal from the general education class should 
only happen when the child’s learning or attention issue—
his/her “disability” under IDEA—is so severe that supplementary 
aids and services can’t provide him/her with an appropriate 
education. 

A key word here is “appropriate.” It refers to what’s suitable or 
right for the child. Sometimes, putting a child in a general

Students who have demonstrated proficiency in subjects where 
they are receiving services of ICT or self contained classes will be 
recommended for removal of those services the following year.  

 

During the IEP Annual meetings, members will review student 
data from Skedula, STARS, benchmark assessments, etc.  

 

Monitoring will be put into place which will consist of quarterly 
reviews of student progress to see if the least restrictive 
environment is a successful setting.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

October Curriculum night: parents are engaged in classroom 
exercises that focus on the instructional shifts. There, parents are 
made aware of the school-wide instructional cohesion that 
students experience across content areas. Parents will visit each 
of their child's teachers by following the child's schedule. During 
that time teachers will share with parents their instructional 
objectives for the class, assessment strategies, alignments to 
common core, etc. This is different than your standard Parent 
Teacher Conferences. This event takes place early in the school 
year prior to grades being available for parents.

welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

While the school has increased the number of students applying and auditioning the diversity of students with regard 
to race and ethnicity is decreasing; specifically, black students enrolled in our school have decreased from 25% in 
2014-2015 to 19% in 2016-2017.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
Increase the recruitment of students who are geared towards a visual arts CTE program via an effective articulation 
program and the establishment of similar arts based feeder schools; with an emphasis on outreach to schools located in 
economically disadvantaged areas so as to retain the diversity of our student population.

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Current students and Art teachers serve as representatives at all 
high school fairs in each borough. 

Effective articulation process based on establishing 
communication with feeder schools, similar art program middle 
schools, visiting middle school op[en houses, inviting middle 
schools to our spring arts festival, and guidance counselor 
outreach to middle school counselors. Particular focus will be 
placed on schools in economically disadvantaged areas in order 
to attract students from the targeted subgroups.  

Systemize the audition process: auditions will be conducted via 
8th grade counselor registration after applications are due in 
December. This will enable students to attend the auditions in 
greater number due to a lack of competing dates with other 
audition schools who have their dates in early December. 

Offer a workshops for 8th graders looking to apply to Art and 
Design. the workshop will focus on creating portfolios in 
anticipation of participation in the audition process. Teachers 
will be offered per session for this activity. There will be several 
workshops in the fall and spring; there will be follow up to 
ensure that these targeted students audition. Particular focus 
will be placed on schools in economically disadvantaged areas in 
order to attract students from the targeted subgroups.

for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,

State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Arts and Design High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The High School of Art & Design will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Team meetings, Inquiry Team, curricular adjustments, and guidance review. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

By tracking student achievement in course completion (credits/grades); on standardized exams (NYS Regents exams, NYC 
Measures of Student Learning, NYSESLAT, PSAT/SAT; and through graduation statistics, we are able to determine the success 
of our program. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Tutoring, SAT prep, SETTS (if applicable), Saturday Academic Academy, PM school, push in services 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Not applicable (we are a high school). 
  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
The data patterns across proficiencies reveal the effects of students’ learning disabilities on their performance on this 
exam.  100% of ELLs who have received ESL services for more than six years are students with IEPs.  The majority of these 
students were born in the U.S. and speak English fluently.  Many do not read or write their home language, but only speak 
it.  However, they continue to score at less than proficient levels on the exam.  These students are outperformed on the exam 
by non-ISS students, who usually reach proficiency within three years of being served in ESL classes.  Moreover, these students 
always perform better on speaking than any other section; their skills are challenged in the listening, reading and writing 
sections by their decoding disabilities.  
  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
ELA Regents data is reviewed by guidance, the inquiry team, and English AP at the beginning of every term.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

This year, we have revamped our ESL program to reflect the new New York State Education Department mandates regarding 
number of minutes, as well as push-in (to core subjects) v. self-contained settings.  HSAD always attempts to group ELLs by 
grade within ELL level, when possible.  The programming challenges arise from the extremely small size of our ELL population; 
the fact that the majority of our ELL population also has other specific IEP-driven programming needs; and the needs of our 
particular school (a CTE art school).  These have led us this year to serve the majority of our ELL population in a push-in 
model.  The ESL teacher pushes in to two ELA classes (one 9th grade and one 10th grade) and one Global Studies class (10th 
grade).  Those classes are homogeneous by grade and ELL level of students served via push-in.  There are two very small self-
contained classes which capture the balance of students whose grade level or program exigencies prevented their being 
served in one of the push-in periods.  These classes are heterogeneous with regard to grade level; the ELL level is 
homogeneous there. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 
 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Not applicable. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not applicable. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

              To ensure that ELLs are programmed by proficiency level for the mandated number of  instruction minutes, 
the ESL teacher works closely with the Assistant Principal of English/ESL and the Assistant Principal of Guidance (who 
is in charge of programming at the school), as well as program office staff.  The ESL teacher obtains the necessary 
reports (RLAT, RLER, RNMR, among others) to verify placement information and to ensure that programming staff 
receive it. 
         a.      Under CR Part 154-2, the NYSED mandates different minutes of service minimums based on NYSESLAT 
achievement level.  At present, HSAD has ELLs only at the transitioning and explanding levels.  Students at the 
transitioning and expanding levels receive 180 minutes of ESL instruction each week from the certified ESL 
teacher.  The majority of these students are served in a push-in setting in a core subject (ELA, social studies).  The 
balance are served in a self-contained ENL class.  The ESL teacher has dual certification in ESL and ELA and is qualified 
to serve the ELLs in their core ELA needs.   
  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

      A variety of strategies is implemented across the curriculum to address student content and academic language needs.  For 
example, if a classroom teacher speaks the native language of any of the ELLs, that teacher offers vocabulary and translation to 
ELLs on an as-needed basis.  Science and social studies vocabulary tutoring has been implemented with both peer and adult 
volunteer tutors.  Math tutoring is available in several of the native languages.  Peer partner arrangements are established 
wherein a non-ELL native speaker of a particular language is assigned to an ELL of the same group, as a classroom 
“buddy.”  Native language materials are available across the curriculum in our school library.  
  
         Additionally, the ESL teacher meets with all current and former ELLs during common free time to support them in content 
area classes.  The ESL teacher provides translation, interpretation and explanation for all content area texts and assignments, 
when requested by teachers or students.  The ESL teacher also directs students to appropriate support materials that facilitate 
acquisition of content through sheltered English or native language. 
  
        Teachers across the curriculum use literacy techniques and context clues when instructing groups with ELLs.  Our school 
inquiry team is focusing on ELLs and developing further suitable strategies based on the data obtained therein. 
  
        The ESL teacher is also licensed in English Language Arts.  With the English department, she has participated in all 
professional development activities conducted around the Common Core, and adapts and implements the teaching and 
assessment strategies acquired in these sessions for the ELL population. 
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
      As HSAD does not have a bilingual program or provide native language arts instruction, the school does not evaluate ELLs in 
the native language.  
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

 6.     a.      At present, there are no SIFE students enrolled at HSAD.   Because HSAD is an audition school, students who wish to 
enroll must have access to information about our entrance process.  This information is available to those enfranchised to an 
academic system; it would not reach someone not attending school.  Should any pedagogue, counselor or administrator 
perceive potential SIFE status in a student, we will use the SIFE questionnaire to determine if the student requires 
categorization as such.  In the unlikely eventuality  that any SIFE ELLs enter our school, we will follow the program model 
prescriptions of the DOE in serving such students.  
        b.      Over the past three school years, we have enrolled a very small number of ELLs who were in US schools for less than 
three years.  These ELLs have received extra tutoring services from the ESL teacher each day during her professional 
period.  They are also enrolled in our school tutoring program two days each week during lunch periods.  The ESL 
teacher/coordinator also conferences regularly with these students’ core curriculum teachers, developing scaffolding 
strategies that will support the acquisition of CALP.  
        c.    (also contains d):  As noted above, ELLs comprise a very small percentage of the student population at HSAD, and it is 
often possible for an ELL to be unique in that status in a content area class, particularly at the level of 4 or more years of 
service.   Moreover, as ESL classes are heterogeneous with regard to placement in terms of years of service, the proficiency 
level subgroups are mixed.   ELLs at these levels are steered toward extra-curricular activities that support their language 
development.  They are strongly encouraged to participate in our peer tutoring programs.   In addition, they are enrolled in 
special Regents preparatory sections to ensure that they receive the instruction they need to master the exams. 
   e.    Former ELLs are tracked by the ESL teacher after they score at the proficient level and are no longer for ESL classes.  The 
ESL teacher conferences with all of their content  area teachers to monitor the former ELLs’ preparedness for Regents exams 
and other assessments.   The ESL teacher offers tutoring to former ELLs on the same schedule as is available to current 
ELLs.  Moreover, ELLs who achieve proficiency on the NYSESLAT are eligible for extended time on Regents  exams.  The ESL 
coordinator tracks these students and ensures they are granted this testing modification.  We also enroll transitional students 
in our after-school Regents preparatory tutoring sessions. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

        Teachers of ELL-SWDs use a variety of leveled materials, depending on the class population’s needs and the subject 
matter.  For courses terminating in Regents exams (e.g., Global History, U.S. History, Living Environment, Earth Science), all 
students (general education and ISS) have access to the same text.  Classroom ISS teachers will provide supplementary 
materials targeted to their classes’ populations.  These include the full range of possible scaffolding supports, including 
glossaries (both English and native language); graphic organizers; visual resources; and reading-level graded texts. With regard 
to instructional strategies, teachers use group-based techniques that extend achievement in the individual student.  Among 
these are Think-Pair-Share; cooperative learning strategies (in which each individual is responsible for a separate component 
of a successful whole); literature circles (for both fiction and non-fiction texts); and Think-Alouds.  Annotated reading is part of 
every  subject class across the curriculum. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

Art and Design uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWD(s) within the least 
restrictive environment; using Common Core Curriculum Standards, anticipation guides and language acquisition activities are 
incorporated across a multitude of subject areas so that students below, above and at grade level can reach their potential. 
  
At present, the majority of ELLs on register at HSAD are SWDs.  Following the flexible programming protocol, we meet 
mandates in the following sequence:  IEP (for special education accommodations); ESL (for placement in and level); art (to 
accommodate student major choice); and academics (to ensure timely accrual of graduation credits).  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The ESL teacher coordinates intervention services for ELLs across the content areas.  She receives curriculum materials from 
social studies and science teachers that are used during tutoring sessions with ELLs.  These materials are all in English, and the 
ESL teacher adapts them to support ELLs in the content areas.  She also arranges for native language tutoring in Math in 
Chinese with two of the senior math faculty.  As noted above, ELLs are strongly encouraged to participate in our peer tutoring 
and Friends of Art & Design tutoring programs. 
  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Due to budget constraints and the extremely small number of ELLs enrolled at our school, no new programs are being 
considered for the upcoming school year. 
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We intend to keep in place all programs currently on offer to our ELL population. 
  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

All programs at HSAD are available to every student.  HSAD offers major study fields in graphic design, illustration, 
photography, film, cartooning and animation, fashion and architecture.  Extra-curricular activities include clubs in a number of 
artistic disciplines, drama club, philosophy club, student government and athletics.   There are no limitations to access for ELLs 
to any program offered in the building.  During ESL class, the ESL teacher highlights extra-curricular and other non-class-based 
activities to the ESL students, and works with administrators and other teachers to make sure ELLs are always represented 
among the student participants.  This year ELLs are participating in extra-curricular activities in a number of the above-
described disciplines. 
HSAD does not have any after-school programs dedicated to ELLs.  ELLs participate with the general population in our Regents 
Prep, SAT Prep and any after-school or Saturday enrichment programs the school offers. 
  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
In addition to the regular classroom texts (which all ELLs receive), teachers across the curriculum engage ELLs with realia and 
audio-visual materials.  In addition, the ESL teacher provides self-generated support materials in a variety of subject areas, 
particularly social studies and science.  Second language dictionaries are available in the ESL classroom.  We have a good range 
of adaptive novels and other texts for ELLs to use in conjunction with assigned texts in ELA classes.  Our library has a range of 
materials in all subject areas in native languages.  We also have a full range of electronic teaching tools available in every 
department, including LCDs with web access, Smart Boards and computer carts with a sufficient number of wireless laptop 
computers for use by all students in a class section.  
  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
HSAD does not offer native language instruction classes.  We do offer heritage foreign language class in Spanish.  
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Required support services are organized and scheduled through the Guidance department.  Counselors review programs, 
transcripts and IEPs to ensure that all support services and resources are grade and age appropriate. 
  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

In addition to the regular classroom texts (which all ELLs receive), teachers across the curriculum engage ELLs with realia and 
audio-visual materials.  In addition, the ESL teacher provides self-generated support materials in a variety of subject areas, 
particularly social studies and science.  Second language dictionaries are available in the ESL classroom.  We have a good range 
of adaptive novels and other texts for ELLs to use in conjunction with assigned texts in ELA classes.  Our library has a range of 
materials in all subject areas in native languages.  We also have a full range of electronic teaching tools available in every 
department, including LCDs with web access, Smart Boards and computer carts with a sufficient number of wireless laptop 
computers for use by all students in a class section.  
  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
In June of the year prior to students entering our school, we offer ELLs the same orientation procedure as we do to all 
students.  Faculty include Guidance faculty (Assistant Principal, Counselors, Pupil Personnel Secretary; College Counselor); 
Parent Coordinator; ESL Coordinator; teacher representatives from every subject; administrative support staff (attendance 
teacher; school aides).  That is the sole pre-entry activity at HSAD. We do not admit students throughout the school year.  Any 
student admitted between July and September of the forthcoming school year begin in September.  Students do not enter 
HSAD midyear.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
19.     HSAD offers Spanish and French to fulfill foreign language requirements.  If students qualify to receive credits for foreign 
language based on native country transcripts, we apply those credits and offer the student another language for additional 
elective foreign language credits. 
  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Not applicable. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Paste response to question here:    
Professional development activities at our school that support the Common Core Learning Standards are 
geared to core curriculum areas.  Teachers participate according to license (the ESL teacher participates 
in Common Core professional development with the English department).  All teachers are guided to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

adapt Common Core teaching strategies for ELLs, using specially prepared scaffolds and other materials 
that will help ELLs master the core subjects. 
  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
At present, beyond the professional development support HSAD provides to all teachers of ELLs, our school has no support 
program in place to address middle-high school transitioning needs. 
           
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The ESL teacher serves as ENL Coordinator and is responsible for scheduling and conducting the invididual ELL parent meetings 
to discuss the goals of the program,their child’s language development progress, their child’s English language proficiency 
assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. When necessary, translators are drawn from among 
HSAD faculty or the Translation and Interpretation office, to ensure effective communication with the parents or guardians 
about the child’s language development in all content areas in English.  
  
In addition, HSAD conducts a number of annual Activities for all parents (including ELL parents), including: 
a)  Welcome Back Breakfast/ Afternoon Event in order to provide general school information and resources,   conducted in 
both Spanish and Chinese, as well as English.  Translation services available. 
 b)  V.E.S.I.D. -Disability outreach workshops with bi-lingual facilitator. Translation Services available. 
c)   College and Financial Aid Workshop – Simultaneous Spanish translation. 
d)    Annual Family Resource Fair ranging from NY Public Library to Health Awareness.  Includes Spanish translation.  Materials 
requested in variety of languages. 
e)   Parent/Teacher Conferences- 'I Speak' / 10 Questions to Ask at Conferences on site translation.  
f)   Hands on activities such as International Dinner/Holiday Workshop/ Spring Festival 
g)  Title I funding availability: Regents and SAT Preparation Workshop - Simultaneous Spanish translation.  
Monthly activities include facilitators: 
h)   Parent Information Sessions and Activities include Pupil Path, Naviance, College Prep, GED, Job Search, Career Outreach, 
Financial Aid, Scholarship, Gallery Exhibits. Internship & Start Business Workshops, Translated materials 
 i)  “How the High School Admissions Process Works, hosted through the Office of Parent Engagement.  Translators are on site 
in French, Spanish and Chinese.  
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our Parent Coordinator distributes her own 'Parent Survey' during Orientation, 'Welcome Back Events', Parent Conferences 
and workshop events.  With this information, HSAD is able to begin identifying the ELL parent population.  Survey responses

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, High School of Art & Design, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and 
activities are adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

The principal has designated the following staff member as the primary Language Access Coordinator (LAC) in Galaxy. 
If there is more than one LAC, list all.

Coordinator? Yes/No  

 

(*Primary) 

 

   

 
* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

By using the ATS reports RHLA and RAPL, we determined that 31 languages other than English are used in homes 
of 465 of our students. 21 of these languages were requested for oral and written communication with the school. 
We ranked these language groups based on the numbers of homes in which each occurs, thereby establishing the 
translation needs levels. In so doing, we created our own internal report for use over time, which includes parent 
and student language and other demographics. This report will produce data we can use to assess trends in home 
languages and translation and interpretation needs.  

We predicted that there would be needs to translate both DOE and school documents. Taking into account that 
document translation services for 9 of the 31 languages are available through the DOE Translation and 
Interpretation Unit, we established translation needs for both school document and the DOE documents that 
would not be offered by the Translation and Interpretation Unit.
