Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our school mission is to create an environment which is child centered and nurturing, recognizing the cultural 
diversity of our community. In partnership with our students, parents, staff and community, there is the belief that all 
students can meet high standards of excellence and challenge. We believe that the role of the school and the home is 
to provide a climate that enhances the student’s cognitive, creative and social growth, thereby increasing the child’s 
potential for success.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
PS 291 is an elementary school serving kindergarten to fifth grade students in University Heights section of the Bronx. 
Our student enrollment is 601 pupils, 88% Hispanic, 11% African American, 1% Asian and 0% White. Our percentage 
of special education students is 23% and English as a New Language Learners is 25%. Our school culture is an 
important characteristic of our learning environment. Our Framework Scores, derived from our Quality Review and 
NYC school survey indicate the following: We scored exceeding in the following areas, Effective school leadership 
(4.91), Trust (4.56), Strong Family and Community Ties (4.51) and Collaborative Teachers (4.05). We scored meeting in 
the following areas: Rigorous Instruction (3.82), Supportive Environment (3.67) and Student Achievement (3.35). Our 
positive school culture carries over to our teacher teams. One strength in our building is the collaboration within our 
teacher teams. Our teams work together to create lessons, goals for students, and assessments that ensure that all of 
our students meet their learning objectives. We have weekly professional learning sessions, common planning 
meetings, a K-2 and 3-5 literacy coach, a math coach, Universal Literacy coach, and Early Reading Matters teacher 
leaders to support each other in reviewing and refining our curriculum. At PS 291 we have many collaborative 
partnerships that support student achievement and growth. Our K-3rd grade teachers will begin their second year 
with our Early Reading Matters (ERM) professional development partnership. Last school year, we received thirty days 
of on-site professional development with an Early Reading Matters coach and six full days of off-site professional 
development. The focus was on early literacy skills such as, guided reading, shared reading, interactive read alouds, 
interactive writing, looking at student work and refining literacy curriculum. We also selected teacher leaders to 
distribute leadership among our K-3 grade teams. The K-2 literacy coach continued the professional learning 
throughout the school year. We have had a Professional Development Learning Site (PDLS) partnership with Lehman 
College for the past seventeen years, where we supervised their student teachers and worked together providing 
professional development. This year, we have been selected as a NYC Teaching Academy (NYCTA) school. NYCTAs give 
aspiring teachers from multiple pathways a passport to high-quality preparation. Through the intensive efforts of NYC 
Department of Education schools and in close partnership with local universities and DOE district leaders, NYCTAs 
offer future educators high quality coaching and clinical preparation embedded in NYC classrooms. NYCTAs are places 
where collaboration, professional learning, and continuous growth and development for all members of the school 
community are deeply embedded in the school culture.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our English as a New Language Learners in bilingual classes or free standing ENL classes need support in achieving the 
CCLS. In particular, we will focus on two subgroups: students whose entry to NYC public schools is less than 3 years 
and/or our long term ENL students. Our newcomer ENLs need to acquire the English language. Our long-term ENLs 
need to develop a deeper understanding of text read, increase academic vocabulary and build reading fluency and 
stamina. Teachers will gather and analyze data for these students in order to inform instruction to best support their 
academic needs. This will be accomplished by creating structural models to support continuous academic growth and 
continuous professional development for teachers who support our ENL population. Our special education students 
who receive related services are making academic progress. The small group instruction is helping them approach 
grade level proficiency in reading and math. Our students in self-contained special education are making some gains, 
but are still struggling with reading comprehension and higher level mathematical reasoning. 

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Last school year, we made the most progress in the Framework - Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to 
the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in 
professional development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. Through our partnership with 
Early Reading Matters (ERM) our K-3 teachers worked collaboratively with the ERM coach, school based literacy 
coaches, the ERM grade leaders and each other to enhance their literacy pedagogy. Our school wide data showed 
progress with student's independent reading levels according to our Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA2) data. 
This school year we will continue our work with our K-3 teachers to deepen their literacy pedagogy. In mathematics 
we will continue our focus on rigorous instruction, with an emphasis on Number Talks and student led questioning 
and discussions. The math coach will also focus on building content knowledge using Zearn.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
● During our previous Quality Review, our rating showed that our instructional core ensures engaging, rigorous, and 
coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners, and that alignment to the common core learning 
standards is proficient (1.1). We will continue this practice and focus on the learning shifts.  

● PS 291 currently uses CKLA in grades K-2 and Expeditionary Learning in 3-5 for rigorous ELA instruction.  

o High Standards using the CCLS are set in all classrooms with a focus on instruction that is motivating to all students 
as well as developing critical thinking skills and ensuring the development of active student engagement.  

o Curriculum is challenging, engaging and aligned across grades, and classes are well defined with clear expectations 
for student success.  

o Curriculum is clear, well structured, and encourages students to build and apply knowledge.  

o Classrooms are interactive and encourage students to build and apply knowledge.  

● Our school strengths are: 

o Creating a coherent progression of skills within the standards from grade to grade so student reading and writing 
knowledge and skills build on previous learning as foundations for ELA concepts taught in earlier years and to build 
toward the later years.  

o Balancing Informational and Literary Text. 

o Students build knowledge about the world through text.  

o Students read the central, grade appropriate text around which instruction is centered. Teachers create more time 
and support in the curriculum for close reading. 

o Creating a coherent progression of skills within the standards from grade to grade so student reading and writing 
knowledge and skills build on previous learning. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

o Using a common language and building a shared understanding of high-quality instruction, which enhances our 
educators’ ability to communicate and align resources across the school 

● Our School needs: This information has been determined by looking at formative classroom data in both ELA and 
Math, NYS testing data in grades in 3 - 5, Periodic Assessments and the Framework for Great Schools report.  

  Our fourth grade students have not made the same progress as their peers in 3rd and 5th grade. We will focus 

on improving ELA achievement within our fourth grade classes. 

  According to our 2017 NYS ELA testing results, in fourth grade the overall percentage that achieved levels 3 & 

4 is 37%, which is a decrease from last year 

o A subgroup within the fourth grade population we will further focus on are the students who scored at proficiency 
level 2 in the NYS ELA.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
● By June 2019, there will be an increase in the number of fourth graders performing at levels 3 & 4 in NYS ELA by 5%.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
PS 291 has a strong positive supportive environment. Constituents of the school community feel safe and supported 
according to the school survey results. Our parents feel that their children are safe at school and feel that there is an 
adult their child trusts and can go to for help with a problem. According to our previous quality review, the rating of 
school culture is well developed. We instill character education through our school wide book of the month. Each text 
is carefully selected based on the socio-emotional learning students will glean from the book’s message. This ensures 
that students from K-5 are all learning these life lessons that will guide them in their positive character development. 
In addition, grades 3-5 often emphasize human rights issues in their literacy program. This year we will begin learning 
about Culturally Responsive Teaching to insure equity for all students. We develop community among staff and 
students via numerous events such as: Dress the School Pink (Breast Cancer Awareness), Dress the School Orange 
(United Against Bullying), Alzheimer’s Fundraiser Walk, Light up Blue for Autism awareness, Red Nose Day and City 
Harvest canned food collection. We host various school celebrations inviting students to our fall, winter and spring 
dances. In addition, we celebrate our school community’s diversity with our Annual Cultural Diversity Day where 
students perform songs/dances celebrating various cultures. We believe these activities foster a sense of spirit and 
community, which brings us together. Our school also supports students’ academic achievements. Students are aware 
of school wide expectations for learning, including the so-called “soft skills” of coming prepared to school, paying 
attention, completing homework, being responsible for personal and school belongings, trying their best, and 
generally learning to take responsibility for their own learning. These are important skills — that have also been 
identified by the DOE — that engender student engagement. They encourage ownership and decision-making, 
requiring the student to be actively engaged, which promotes college and career readiness. Our teachers are 
knowledgeable about the different reading, writing and math levels and learning styles in their classes. According to 
our previous quality review, our findings show an area of focus for statement 1.1 of the instructional core: Ensure 
engaging, rigorous and coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners and aligned to CCLS 
and/or content standards.  

 

Our area of need this school year is to increase mathematical discussions and reasoning skills. Our professional 
development focus in math will be on Number Talks. We will strengthen student accuracy, efficiency and flexibility 
with mental math and computation strategies. The heart of Number Talks is classroom conversations focused on 
making sense of mathematics. Number talks will help students clarify their math thinking, investigate and apply 
mathematical relationships, build a repertoire of efficient strategies, make decisions about choosing efficient 
strategies for specific problems, consider and test other strategies to see if they are mathematically logical. This will 
ensure that students are able to use different math strategies, which will help build fluency in mathematics. This will 
also reinforce their critical thinking skills which will lead to increased achievement in mathematics. We also have 
added the Zearn Math curriculum to enhance our current math curriculum. Zearn includes independent digital 
student lessons, small group lessons, whole class activities and digital assessments and reports. Also included is a 
year-long professional development series.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

At PS 291 we have a structure for continuous professional development with our staff. Our school holds weekly 
professional development where staff participates in tiered activities based on teacher needs and student data 
trends. Our professional development topics include Number Talks, student questioning, differentiated student 
activities, effective feedback, curriculum adjustment and alignment, student learning goals, literacy centers, ENL 
strategies, social emotional learning, fluency/application in mathematics, Early Reading Matters literacy professional 
development and advanced literacy skills. According to our 2014-2015 quality review, our school received a proficient 
rating in quality review statement 4.2:  

Engage in structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared leadership 
and focuses on improved student learning.  

This year, our math coach will lead professional development for our kindergarten through fifth grade teachers on 
utilizing Zearn math curriculum and continue Number Talks. We are beginning our second year with our Early Reading 
Matters (ERM) partnership. Our school has been assigned an ERM reading coach, who provides thirty days of school 
based professional development for our kindergarten through third grade teachers. The literacy areas of focus are 
shared reading, interactive read aloud, independent reading, literacy centers, interactive writing, guided reading and 
benchmark data analysis. We are beginning our third year with our Universal Literacy coach. The Universal Literacy 
coach works with the kindergarten through second grade teachers. Her focus is on the Five Pillars of reading - 
Phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. We have been chosen as a NYC Teaching 
Academy school. NYCTAs are places where collaboration, professional learning, and continuous growth and 
development for all members of the school community are deeply embedded in the school culture. Administrators 
and teachers actively contribute to an environment in which students and pre-service teachers develop the 
knowledge, skills, and mindsets that will prepare them for their futures. 

Our second graders are an area of focus this year. We want to ensure that students are approaching or meeting grade 
level reading by the end of second grade. According to our Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA2), last year 43% 
of our second graders read at or above grade level. The second grade teachers will work closely with the Universal 
Literacy coach, the Early Reading Matters consultant and the onsite K-2 literacy coach. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

At PS 291, effective school leadership sets the tone for high achieving schools. According to our 2017-2018 Measure 
of Leadership Practice (MOLP), we received a well-developed in the following big ideas: Curriculum, Pedagogy, 
Resource Allocation, Learning Environment, Assessment, Goal Setting, High Expectations, Teacher Feedback, Teacher 
Teams, and Monitoring and Revising. The principal continuously supports the professional growth of teachers and 
staff. We offer high quality weekly professional development; have onsite literacy and math coaches, staff developers 
and mentors to support our teachers. The principal meets three times a year with each individual staff member. At 
these meetings the following are discussed; student progress/achievement, teacher professional goals, curriculum 
based decisions, resources needed to enhance student learning, and professional development opportunities. At 
these meetings, the teachers have an open dialogue with school leaders where they can make suggestions and/or 
modifications that will help increase student achievement. The staff is also included in many decision-making areas, 
such as SLT, the hiring committee, curriculum decision-making, AIS intervention programs, and After school programs. 
Our school teacher survey reports show 95% or higher in the following categories: instructional core, systems for 
improvement and school culture. Also, 96% of the teacher staff agrees that the principal encourages open 
communication on important school issues. The principal has mentored staff members enrolled in School 
Administrator programs. According to our 2014-2015 quality review findings, our school received a well developed 
(area of celebration) rating in quality review statement 3.4 Establish a culture for learning that communicates high 
expectations to staff, students and families, and provide supports to achieve those expectations. The level of trust in 
school leadership is reflected in the fact that all eligible teachers selected the option to have informal observations 
rather than the formal observation option. This shows that the teachers feel comfortable enough with the level of 
their everyday pedagogy that they don’t need to schedule observations formally, and there is a great deal of 
confidence in the effectiveness of the administrative staff that observes them.  

According to our 2017-2018 Measure of Leadership Practice (MOLP), our area for improvement was to improve 
instructional strategies such as higher order questioning, accountable talk and student choice. We need to continue 
creating more opportunities for student led discussions with open ended questions through rigorous tasks. Currently, 
our average teacher rating in Teach Boost for indicator 3B-Questions and discussion techniques is 3.09.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

At PS 291, we strive to create a welcoming environment for families and take advantage of community resources to 
enrich the cultural and civic life of the school. Parent communication and involvement are very important. The parent 
coordinator, the community assistant, and the guidance counselor all work together to invite parents into the school 
and provide translation services for parents. According to our 2016-2017 School Quality Snapshot, Strong Family - 
Community Ties, 98% of parents say the school staff regularly communicate with them about how parents can help 
their child learn and 97% of parents say they have communicated with their child's teacher about their child's 
performance. In the area of Trust, 98% of parents say that the school staff work hard to build trusting relationships 
with them.  

 

Some of our parental involvement includes: parents invited to take part in celebrations, communication with parents 
via school calendar and grade specific news letters, Tuesday meetings for parents with their child’s teacher, parent 
workshops that target specific needs and interests, the Global Connect phone system, and our school website. 
Parents are invited to Curriculum Day, where they visit their child's class to view lessons. A showcase event we 
conduct every spring and take great pride in is our Cultural Diversity Day. Classroom teachers will poll students to 
choose a favorite country, then sign up to present music, dance and interesting facts about the country they’ve 
chosen. The celebration takes place in our schoolyard and parents and family are invited. We are continuing our arts 
program in our school. We have an on-site art teacher, we offer the Project Arts after school program, Dream Yard 
theater classes in kindergarten and Dancing Classrooms program for fifth grade students. We have also cultivated 
many community partnerships such as Good Shepherd After School Services and Good Shepherd Family Counseling 
Services. Health First provides health insurance for families, and NY Cares Winter Wishes fulfills students’ Christmas 
wish lists. In addition, we take part in City Harvest Holiday food drive, St. Jude Mathathon fundraiser, ALZ Walk, 
Autism Awareness, clothing donations and Red Nose Day. Our student attendance rate is 93.2%. According to the 
2016-2017 data, 100% of our parents took the School Survey.  

 

An area of need in our school is enhancing discussions between parents and teachers about student academic 
performance. Parents need a deeper understanding of student proficiency levels and benchmark requirements by 
grade as it pertains to their children.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32 

 

During the 2018-2019 school year, school leaders, teachers, and support personnel will share student data with parents 
at least 3 times per year facilitating a deeper understanding of student proficiency levels and support strategies, leading 
to an increase from 3.78 to 3.85 on the Learning Environment Survey: Rigorous Instruction.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

 

Student data will be shared with families in a way that they can 
understand a child's learning needs and success by school 
leaders, teachers and support personnel. The Parent Coordinator 
and/or Community Coordinator will provide training for parents 
to become familiar with NYCDOE websites and Webinars. This 
will allow parents to partner with the school to provide 
appropriate student support.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Our teachers are all fully licensed . Approximately 75% have an average of ten or more years teaching experience in 
this school. We have a high retention rate with our staff. We believe the high retention rate is due to certain 
structures we have in place in our school. For example, our teachers work collaboratively with their grade level 
colleagues in addition to meeting with support staff and AIS service providers. Our school offers weekly professional 
development to enhance teacher pedagogy. By carefully calibrating the professional development offered throughout 
the year, we aim to ensure that teachers become highly qualified by achieving and surpassing their NYS mandated 
professional development hours. Approximately 95% of our teachers are highly qualified. We also focus on team 
building and school spirit. For example, we work together as a school to support certain charities, such as St. Jude 
children’s hospital and the Alzheimer Foundation. We come together as a staff to support breast cancer research, 
autism awareness, and anti-bullying campaigns. For these initiatives, we all dress alike to show our support. The staff 
participates in celebrations with the students, such as Halloween parties, Cultural Awareness Day and academics-
related classroom culminating activities. This level of camaraderie and cooperation helps keep our staff retention 
high. 

Our special education teachers are fully licensed and most have ten or more years teaching experience. They work 
collaboratively with the general education teachers to plan instruction that will support this population. Our school 
offers weekly professional development to enhance teacher pedagogy. Our bilingual and ENL teachers work 
collaboratively with each other in addition to their grade level colleagues.  

We strategically place teachers into their programs based on licenses, Masters degrees, and experience. We created 
programs that we felt would benefit the school such as our Art Program, Technology, Science clusters and AIS 
providers. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
To ensure high quality and ongoing professional development we will:

● base weekly opportunities for all staff to participate in rigorous professional development on staff-submitted 
requests and cabinet-level data analysis in order to actively support teacher growth 

● K-3rd teachers will continue with ERM professional development 

● K-5 ZEARN training with the math coach 

● NYC Teaching Academies will provide professional development  

● increase student experience of rigorous instruction 

● increase opportunities for teachers’ collaborative discourse and planning.  

● ensure teachers’ deep understanding of the components of Danielson’s Framework for Teaching 

● provide support to teachers through frequent classroom visits, actionable feedback, coaching and professional 
development 

● provide our new teachers with two periods a week of mentoring with experienced mentors.  

Our school holds targeted and purposeful weekly professional development sessions every Monday for 80 minutes in 
which every staff member, including educational assistants, are required to attend. The agendas for these sessions 
include schedule-sensitive topics concerning data analysis, CCLS, CKLA, Expeditionary Learning, Eureka Math, ERM, 
Reading Matters, NYC Teaching Academy, RTI, Danielson Framework, incorporating technology, classroom 
management, goal setting, questioning & discussion techniques, and effective feedback, among others. These 
sessions are led by: the coaches, administration, staff developers and/or teachers. Our coaches also model lessons for 
teachers, plan inter-visitations where new staff visit seasoned teachers to learn strategies to implement in their own 
classrooms. Our school provides one common grade level prep period per week for grades K-5. The teachers can meet 
with each other, with their coaches or with their administrators. In addition, teachers and staff find common time on 
their own initiative to plan, adjust assessments, etc. We also offer summer institutes where teachers come together 
to plan curriculum, develop weekly lessons, develop assessments and pace out the instructional calendar. 

The principal and assistant principals also attend district provided professional development, school provided 
professional development as well as developing their pedagogy through other professional venues. 

 

We will provide differentiated professional development by conducting needs assessments on our staff to determine 
past professional development, state mandates that need to be met and areas of interest for the staff. We provide 
mentoring professional development for new staff. We will also provide differentiated ENL professional development 
by including session for non-ENL certified staff and certified ENL staff. We will continue to provide Number Talks 
professional development in math to our staff this year.

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
We host a Kindergarten orientation session in August where we share our school information and expectations for 
kindergarten. The parents meet the administrators, the guidance counselor, teachers and other school staff. Our 
speech teachers present a workshop to the parents, which includes many tips and strategies for the parents to use 
with their children at home to better prepare them for kindergarten. Our pupil accounting secretary visits the 
neighborhood preschools to provide brochures about our school to the incoming parents. Our school psychologist 
conducts the turning-five evaluations for the zone. The psychologist explains the supports that the students will 
receive once they attend our school.  

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
The members of the MOSL team met to determine which appropriate assessment measures would be used this 
school year. The MOSL team surveyed the staff to receive feedback about the current assessments being used. We 
then decided, based on teacher feedback, if we would continue to use those assessments or develop new 
assessments. The teachers based their decisions on current assessments used, NYS testing data results and student 
work samples. The coaches provide ongoing professional development on administering, scoring and analyzing 
assessment results. These results are tracked through class spreadsheets and feedback is given. Timely data is then 
analyzed for implications for instruction, and specific action plans are devised and implemented. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met.

2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 291, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

PS 291 will support parents and families of Title I students by:

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

PS 291, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards and Assessments.

SECTION B - Instruction 
In order to enhance academic growth and support for our ELL students, an after school and 
Saturday program for grades 1 to 5 is needed in order to provide these students with 
differentiated instruction through small group work. The program will focus on students’ needs 
and areas of weakness such as vocabulary, comprehension, and reading fluency. The program 
will also look at maintaining and further developing student strengths in the area of mathematics. 
By supporting our ELL students in the early grades of 1st and 2nd, we hope to keep the 
achievement gap of our ELLs from growing. By supporting our ELL students in grades 3, 4 , and 
5 we will be helping students achieve grade level standards. Students will be grouped according 
to their language acquisition level as measured by the results of the NYSITELL and 
NYSESLAT. For grades 3 to 5, ELA and MATH scores will also be considered when grouping 
the students. 
 
Data analysis used in determining student needs and grouping: 
 
1.         An analysis of the breakdown of NYSESLAT scores for grades K to 5 across the four 
modalities of: reading, writing, listening and speaking show that students perform higher on the 
listening and speaking than they do on the reading and writing sections. 
 
2.         An analysis of the breakdown of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th  grade ELA scores for ENL 
students shows the following: 
3rd Grade: 7 students scored a 1, 15 students scored a 2, 8 students scored a 3, 42students scored

•        Description of the Program 
 
Based on the above data, students are identified as eligible for the after school and Saturday 
programs. Parents are notified in their preferred language of their child’s eligibility to participate 
in these programs. Once parents have signed and returned the enrollment form for their child, the 
student is then placed according to his/her needs. These letters are filed and maintained in the 
main office. In addition, teachers will be responsible for taking student attendance and 
submitting those records to the main office. 
 
 
Four bilingual/ESL teachers and two content area teachers will implement the literacy and math 
frameworks in eight classrooms using the workshop model (Title III funds will be used to pay for 
the 4 ESL/Bilingual teachers. Content area teachers will be payed for by other funding sources). 
Team teaching, flexible groupings and direct instruction will allow teachers to target the 
individual needs of the students. This model allows teachers to work with students on an 
individual basis, in small groups and whole class. The ratio of instructional time for 
ESL/Bilingual and content area teachers will be commensurate to the students English language 
proficiency . The student sub-groups include:

Saturday Program - Grades 3-5 
The Saturday Program will provide support to ELL students from 9:00am to 12:00pm beginning 
on October 20, 2018 and ending April 13, 2019. Students who are entering and emerging will 
receive two hours of ENL instruction and an hour of content area instruction. Students who are 
transitioning and expanding, will receive one hour of ENL instruction and 2 hours of content 
area instruction. 
 
Students in grades 3-5: 
Teachers will provide instruction in reading comprehension and writing. The teachers will focus 
on how to answer factual versus inferential questions. In addition, teachers will instruct students 
on the use of graphic organizers, sequencing, character traits, and comparing/contrasting. In the

content area of mathematics, the teachers will focus on computation and word problems. In 
addition, teachers will also cover fractions, measurement, time, and geometry. 
 
After School Program - Grades 1-5 
The After School Program will provide additional assistance to ELL students two times a week 
from 2:40 pm to 5:00pm beginning October 17, 2018 and ending May 30, 2019. Students in 
grades 3-5 will focus on reading comprehension and fluency. Students who are entering and 
emerging will receive an hour and 20 minutes of ENL instruction and an hour of 
content. Students who transitioning and expanding, will receive one hour of ENL instruction and 
1 hour and 20 minutes of content area instruction. Learning activities are planned to scaffold 
students’ learning from previously mastered material to new concepts.  We will look at the 
outcome of our assessment tools to drive our instruction in order to meet the students’ needs, 
increase their strengths, deliver lessons suitable to their learning styles and achieve student 
outcome.  Therefore, through the careful analysis of running records, teacher made exams, 
checklists, portfolios and teacher observations we can achieve this and also look at additional 
support systems to put in place in order to move the students to excel to their maximum 
potential.

Time will be allotted for Professional Development in several different ways. Agendas and 
attendance sheets will be kept on file in the principal’s office. 
 
 
- The teachers will come together for three hours on Wednesday, October 10th to plan for their 
groups. This planning time will be of no cost to the Title III program. 
- Time will be allotted on Professional Learning Mondays from 2:35 to 3:55, for the 
ESL/Bilingual Teachers and the Content area teachers to come together and co-plan. Our 
Literacy (Ms. Ilarraza, Ms. Bucaj, Ms. Rivera coach & Bilingual Teacher) and Math (Ms. 
Aguilar) Coaches will also be a part of this conversation. The language development needs of 
our students will be discussed as well as strengths, needs, and differentiation. Teachers will 
follow the SIOP model (Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol). The eight interrelated 
components of the SIOP Model include: Lesson Preparation, Building Background, 
Comprehensible Input, Strategies, Interaction, Practice/Application, Lesson Delivery and Review 
& Assessment. This is of no cost to the Title III program.

Part C: Professional Development  
 
- The teachers will come together for three hours on Saturday, October 13th to plan for their 
groups. This is of no cost to the Title III program. 
- Time will be allotted every Saturday morning from 8:30am to 9:00am for teachers to engage in 
professional learning and planning. Teachers will follow the SIOP model (Sheltered Instruction

Preparation, Building Background, Comprehensible Input, Strategies, Interaction, 
Practice/Application, Lesson Delivery and Review & Assessment. This is of no cost to the Title 
III program. 
 
 
Literacy Focus: 
Our Professional Development will be around Guided Reading. Guided Reading is a small group 
instructional model that allows teachers to provide instruction that targets specific reading 
strategies for the 4-6 students he or she is working with at one time. Guided reading groups are at 
the students’ instructional reading level. This means that students can successfully read 90% - 
94% of the words correctly. Students should be assessed before being placed in an appropriate 
homogeneous group at their instructional reading level.  Guided Reading Groups are the 
backbone of a balanced literacy program. Because students are grouped by reading ability, you 
can target each group’s specific needs. Research indicates that, to increase fluency and 
comprehension, the same story should be read 3-5 times.   
 
Mathematics Focus: 
Vocabulary instruction is essential to effective math instruction. Not only does it include 
teaching math-specific terms such as "percent" or "decimal," but it also includes understanding 
the difference between the mathematical definition of a word and other definitions of that word. 
 
· 
Demonstrate that vocabulary can have multiple meanings. Help students understand the 
different meanings of words such as "table" and "quarter," as well as how to use them correctly 
in a mathematical context. 
· 
material better if they explain it to another student, and the new student will benefit from hearing 
the explanation in their first language. (Check the hotlinks for a list of bilingual translations of 
math vocabulary in multiple languages). 
· 
Provide visual cues, graphic representations, gestures, realia, and pictures. Offer students 
the chance to work with objects and images in order to master vocabulary. If there aren't enough 
items for each student, use manipulatives on the overhead or posted throughout the classroom, 
and demonstrate the vocabulary in front of the students. For example, Hillary created a Math 
Word Wall that has three parts: key vocabulary, "in your own words" definitions, and a variety 
of ways to portray a function. For example, multiplication is portrayed by the following symbols: 
x, *, and ( ). 
· 
decide which math function they should apply. Example: "more than" means "add." (See hotlinks 
for more references about math vocabulary.)

Studies show that parental involvement has a positive impact on student success. With this in 
mind, we have come up with several ways to embrace parents into the school community, and 
therefore, in their children’s education. Time will be allotted for Parental Involvement in several 
different ways. Agendas and attendance sheets will be kept on file in the principal’s office. The 
following are some examples of how we will achieve this: 
 
1) We intend to have a celebration every four to six weeks.  Students will showcase the 
culminating activity for the unit they have been studying. This celebration will include a share 
aloud in which parents will have an opportunity to listen to their children read as well as become 
active participants in the development of their child’s academic progress. Prior to the celebration, 
the ENL teacher will meet with the parents to discuss how the students’ work is linked to the 
state exams of NYSESLAT, ELA, and MATH. The parents will receive packets discussing 
expectations for each exam. In addition, parents will also receive information on what the school 
is doing to help their children and how they, the parents, can help support their children at home. 
At the end of every celebration, we will have time built in, to ensure that all parents have time to 
sit with the classroom teacher to discuss each child’s individual progress along with the best 
possible ways to support the student at home.  
 
2) Parents are invited to workshops on Parent Outreach Tuesdays (2:40 to 3:50). Parents are 
invited to attend workshops and one-on-one meetings to discuss curriculum, expectations, data, 
strengths/needs, goals of the program, language development progress, language proficiency 
assessment results and language development needs in content areas. 
 
3) Parents will also be invited to workshops on Saturdays from 9:00 to 12:00. These workshops 
will be lead by Dr. Nancy Dubetz, professor at Lehman College. She will conduct ENL classes 
for the parents to assist them in acquiring the English language. In addition, she will also have 
family literacy workshops for both parents and students together. These workshops will take 
place during the Spring 2017 semester. There will be a total of 6 sessions and the dates are as 
follows Jan. 14 & 21, Feb. 4 & 11, and March 4 & 11. There will be no cost to the Title III 
program for these workshops. 
 
The local community makeup is 85% Hispanic.  We are a local zone, neighborhood school, 
which serves this community.  As a result, all notices, memorandums and other parent 
information communication is provided in Spanish as well as English. An oral translator is 
provided at all of the above-mentioned meetings. If need be, the oral translation unit is contacted 
if we can not provide the service.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses DRA to assess literacy skills. There are 162 students  who are English Language Learners currently enrolled in 
our school. Of these students, 152 are 0 to 3 year ELLs and 10 students are 4 to 6 year ELLs. 149 of our ELL students fall in 
levels 1 & 2 of the DRA benchmarks. 13 of our ELL students fall in levels 3 &4 of the DRA benchmarks. Upon review of our data, 
we conclude the following: 
- The majority of the students are progressing as they should as per their years of service. 
- We have approximately 3 students who have been receiving 4 to 6 years of services and are not progressing as their peers, 
however, these students have IEPs due to their special needs.   
  
Based on this data, we noticed that the 3 to 6 year ELL's needed additional support in the areas of reading and writing. To this 
end, we adopted the Core Knowledge program which emphasises phonemic awareness, grammar rules, vocabulary building, 
sight words, and reading comprehension for grades K to 2 and we adopted Expeditionary Learning Program for grades 3 to 5.

Our teachers continue to differentiate instruction through guided reading and small group instruction/support. 
    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We have several structures in place to support our ELL students.  All of our ELL students are in an ENL or Bilingual class. In 
addition, we have out of classroom teachers who work collaboratively to support the ELLs. These teachers include: Literacy 
coach, Math coach, Universal District Literacy Coach (Bilingual License), AIS Teacher (Bilingual License), Guided Reading 
Teacher, ENL Teacher (TESOL License). 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of the ELL programs by looking at the data for our ELLs from the standardized exams, school 
benchmark testing (DRA), classroom tests, teacher observations/conferring and homework/class /work.  After assessing all of 
these components and reviewing all the programs we are using, we discuss the results at grade level meetings. It is at the 
grade meetings that strengths and weaknesses of the programs and students are discussed and adjustments are made to meet 
the students needs more effectively. We use this data to drive and plan for instruction. Our ultimate goal is to meet the AYP 
for our students.

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered and analyzed, students are grouped according to areas of need. Students are 
supported in small groups by the classroom teacher, AIS teacher, ENL teacher, Universal District Literacy Coach. 
 
Our ENL students are invited to all support programs throughout the year: Summer school, After School, Saturday School. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Progress monitoring is the practice of assessing student performance using assessments on a repeated basis to determine how 
well a student is responding to instruction.  Data obtained from progress monitoring can (1) determine a student’s rate of 
progress, (2) provide information on the effectiveness of instruction and whether to modify the intervention, and (3) identify 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

the need for further or additional information.   Progress monitoring data is also used to determine a student’s movement 
through tiers. The intensity of instruction/intervention will determine the frequency of progress monitoring.   
  
Public School 291 uses classroom observations, assessments developed by classroom teachers as well as other teaching 
support personnel to determine a student’s movement across the tiers by examining rate of progress and level of performance 
over time.  
  
Results of assessments at each individual Tier are used to evaluate each student’s understanding of the tested strategy or 
skill.  The various assessments are used as measures of listening comprehension.  After all assessments have been scored, 
individual student progress decisions are made.  Repeated readings and teacher support scaffold students up to the on–
grade level passage.  Students build background on the topic, they staircase up to the on-grade- level passage , which includes 
richer vocabulary and language structures.   
  
A key component of Public School 291 framework is the use of data to inform educational decision-making at the individual 
student, classroom, and school levels. Benchmark/screening assessments and progress monitoring data inform decisions 
relative to risk status, level and type of interventions needed to help individual students make progress.  As part of our 
ongoing evaluation and support, we ensure to include our parents.  Parent involvement is at the forefront of our RTI 
services.  Open exchange of ideas and effective communication allows our guidance counselor to better advocate and tailor 
the supports that we have set up for our students.  Parents are invited to sit in classroom to get a better sense of their 
child.  They are looking at the student and for a few moments not as a son or daughter.  This exchange allows the parent to 
assess the progress of the students as an active participant and not just a passive partner. Classroom teachers will be inviting 
parents to participate in workshops on a variety of topics. The teachers will share the curriculum with the parents so that the 
parents can supplement and complement the classroom instruction at home.     
  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Every year more and more students are scoring on the proficient level on the NYSITELL exam. We attribute this to the fact that 
over 90% of our new registrants attended a pre-school program where the language of instruction was English. In spite of the 
fact that their home language survey reflects a language other than English spoken in the home, the students are more 
dominant in English. 
  
After review of our NYSESLAT data over the last few years, we are noticing the following patterns: 
- In the last few years there has been a steady decrease in the number of English Language learners, however, in the last two 
years, this number has stabilized. 
- The majority of students who are falling in the beginning  level of NYSESLAT are new comers to our school/country (0 to 3 
years of ELL service). 
- Students who have remained in our school are showing adequate growth on the NYSESLAT and eventually scoring proficient 
(15 students fall in the 4 to 6 years of ELL services category of which 3 of these students are in self contained Special Education 
classes and 1 student has an active IEP). 
  
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Through our collaboration with Lehman College, we analyze the data and provide professional development to the staff. Two 
TESOL certified teachers, one Lehman Professor, Literacy Coach, and Universal District Literacy Coach all worked together to 
provide ENL professional staff development throughout the school year. This professional development included: 
- analyzing data 
- tracking student progress 
- using data to plan for instruction 
- ENL strategies

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our school offers a Free Standing ENL Program. Students in our ENL Program receive all instruction in English. The 
number of ENL instructional units that a student receives is determined by the student English language proficiency 
levels (as determined by the NYSITELL or NYSESLAT scores.) These services are provided through three different 
instructional models of Free Standing ENL: 
  
1. Self-Contained: A licensed TESOL teacher integrates ENL methodologies while working with all ELL students in the 
class. 
2. Stand Alone (Pull Out): A licensed ENL teacher will provide instruction in English using ENL methodologies. 
3. Integrated (Push-In): The ENL teacher works with ELLs during content instruction in collaboration with classroom 
teachers to provide language acquisition and vocabulary support while retaining their content instructional time. 
  
Students are serviced according to their proficiency levels. Entering and Emerging students receive a minimum of 360 
minutes of ENL instruction per week. Transitioning and Expanding students receive a minimum of 180 minutes per 
week. And students scoring commanding receive a minimum of 90 minutes per week for two years. 
    
   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

We strongly believe that students acquire literacy most effectively in the language most familiar to them. Therefore, 
our Transitional Bilingual Program is designed so that our pupils develop conceptual skills in their native language as 
they learn English. The TBE class is grouped heterogeneously with mixed proficiency levels. This program includes an 
ENL component to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Students receive one unit of HLA to 
integrate and develop communication and literacy skills in the students’ home language while cultivating an 
appreciation of their history and culture. In addition, students receive a minimum of two content areas in native 
language for Entering and Emerging; and a minimum of one content area for Transitioning and Expanding. 
 
As the student’s English language proficiency increases, instructional time in the native language decreases. When 
ELLs reach proficiency on the NYSELAT, they are transferred to an all-English program with transitional support. Our 
main objectives are to: 
  
• Provide grade level academic work in the student’s native language to develop   
   conceptual understanding and learning strategies that will prepare ELLs to think  
   critically, problem solve and communicate in two languages. 
• Attain English Language proficiency within three years 
• Develop oral and written fluency: BICS and CALP

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

During the course of the day, the students will receive their mandated ENL minutes from the bilingual or ENL classroom 
teacher.   
 
- Students who scored Entering on the NYSESLAT will receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction and 180 minutes of ENL/ELA 
instruction.   
- Students who scored Emerging on the NYSESLAT will receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction, 180 minutes of ENL/ELA 
instruction, and 90 minutes of stand alone ENL or Integrated ENL/Content area instruction. 
- Students who scored Transitioning on the NYSESLAT will receive 90 minutes of ENL/ELA instruction and 90 minutes of stand 
alone ENL or Integrated ENL/Content area instruction.      
- Students who scored Expanding on the NYSESLAT will receive 180 minutes of ENL/ELA or other content area instruction.    
- Students who scored Commanding (Proficient) will continue to receive services for an additional two years for 90 minutes per 
week of integrated ENL in ELA or content area.  
- Students in the TBE program receive one HLA unit. 
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  
To develop content understanding in Literacy and Mathematics we have instituted the following procedures:

•     Instructions/Directions in the native language 
•     Glossaries 
•     Buddy system 
-       Small group differentiation  
  
  
All of our ELL support services, resources, and materials correspond to the CCLS. 
   
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   We ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language by using the following assessments: 
•     Spanish LAB (Diagnostic) 
*       DRA (Diagnostic) 
•     ELE (Summative) 
•     El Sol (On-going 3 times a year) 
•     Teacher Observations (On-going throughout the day) 
•     Teacher conferences with students (On-going throughout the day) 
*       Teachers develop and administer native language assessments in content area subjects. Teachers use the results of these 
exams to monitor student progress. Instruction is then differentiated to meet the needs of the students. (Summative) 
*       Online literacy through MyOn allows teachers to assign books and activities in students' native language. Teachers and 
parents are able to monitor student literacy progress through this program. (On-going throughout the year) 
    
  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

There are certain ELL populations in the school which are in need of more specific and skill based instruction. These groups 
include: SIFE students, Long term ELLs, newcomers and ELLs with special needs. In order to provide additional support for 
these groups, our Academic Intervention Service Coordinator will offer the following Academic Interventions: 
  
•     AIS guided reading 
•     After-School 
•     Saturday Academy 
•     Spring Academy 
•     50 Minutes Small group instruction 
•     Summer School 
•     Fundations 
*          Differentiated instruction 
•     Related services as per IEP, if applicable 
 
  
It is of prime importance that our new arrivals feel socially accepted and others see them as knowledgeable people from a 
respected culture. To ease the cultural transition and facilitate adaptation, it is crucial that our newcomers are appropriately 
placed and provided with the necessary tools to be successful. For our newcomers, who are at the beginning level on the 
assessments, we will also provide AIS support. They will be invited to attend after school programs funded by Title III and the 
Saturday academy as well. These programs will improve decoding skills, phonemic awareness and building basic interpersonal

communication skills. 
  
Special Education ELLs will receive mandated ENL services based on their IEP’s. They will participate in after school and 
Saturday academies to build their Reading, Writing and Mathematic skills. Our I.E.P. teacher provides small group instruction 
to our Special Education ELL Students.  She provides services to students who are experiencing reading difficulties. 
  
SIFE students will participate in several different academic intervention programs to help them develop the basic skills they are 
lacking due to their interrupted education. We will provide a period of AIS instruction each day. We will also provide support 
to these students during the 50 minutes extended time as well. 
  
Long term ELLs will receive extra support through the use of Q-TEL strategies. This will be used by the ENL teacher who has 
been trained in Q-TEL. This model will help to develop academic cognitive skills, reading comprehension skills, fluency, critical 
thinking skills and other cognitive and meta-cognitive skills. 
  
Former ELLs receive 90 minutes of ENL for two additional years of ELL support and two years of continued testing 
accomodations (extended time and glossaries and translated versions of content area exams). Former ELLs are invited to to 
participate in TITLE III funded programs and Saturday academy. 
 
In each program model, the differentiation of instruction for developing ELLs is provided by teachers planning differentiated 
tasks according to students abilities. In addition, teachers work with small guided homogeneous groups of students to guide 
information processing and give feedback to students. 
    
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Some instructional strategies and grade level materials that teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 
content areas and accelerate English language development are: 
  
Program Names 
•     Core Knowledge, Units of Study, Expeditionary Learning 
•     Small group instructional support by the reading specialist. 
•     Differentiated instruction according the student’s interest, and learning ability. 
•     Extended day and After-school program 
•     Saturday Academy 
  
  
Instructional Strategies 
•     Previewing: reviewing titles, section headings, and photo captions to get a sense of the structure and content of a reading 
selection  
•     Predicting: using knowledge of the subject matter to make predictions about content and vocabulary and check 
comprehension; using knowledge of the text type and purpose to make predictions about discourse structure; using 
knowledge about the author to make predictions about writing style, vocabulary, and content  
•     Skimming and scanning: using a quick survey of the text to get the main idea, identify text structure, confirm or question 
predictions  
•     Guessing from context: using prior knowledge of the subject and the ideas in the text as clues to the meanings of unknown 
words, instead of stopping to look them up  
•     Paraphrasing: stopping at the end of a section to check comprehension by restating the information and ideas in the text  
•     Encourage students not to focus too much on their mistakes 
•     Encourage writing for real purposes by publishing in innovative ways  
•     Encourage the use of different strategies for accessing vocabulary needed and for recording new vocabulary for use in

future writing 
•     Teach all aspects of word knowledge and spelling through specific activities including games, quizzes, etc. 
  
  
Teachers help students learn when and how to use instructional strategies in several ways.  
•     By modeling the strategies aloud, talking through the processes of previewing, predicting, skimming and scanning, and 
paraphrasing. This shows students how the strategies work and how much they can know about a text before they begin to 
read word by word.  
•     By allowing time in class for group and individual previewing and predicting activities as preparation for in-class or out-of-
class reading. Allocating class time to these activities indicates their importance and value.  
•     By using cloze (fill in the blank) exercises to review vocabulary items. This helps students learn to guess meaning from 
context.  
•     By encouraging students to talk about what strategies they think will help them approach a reading assignment, and then 
talking after reading about what strategies they actually used. This helps students develop flexibility in their choice of 
strategies.  
•     Modeling all aspects of the writing process 
•     Teaching the text organization and language features of different genres through a range of different activities 
•     Jointly constructing texts with students 
•     Supporting the development of editing and proof reading skills 
•     Using shared experiences to write class or individual books/texts 
•     Using photos and other visual stimuli (pictures) in the early stages of writing development 
•     Using groups and pairs to develop group texts 
  
  
Teachers discuss the purposes of reading with students.  
•     Reading to learn the language: Reading material is language input. By giving students a variety of materials to read, 
instructors provide multiple opportunities for students to absorb vocabulary, grammar, sentence structure, and discourse 
structure as they occur in authentic contexts. Students thus gain a more complete picture of the ways in which the elements of 
the language work together to convey meaning.  
•     Reading for content information: Students' purpose for reading in their native language is often to obtain information 
about a subject they are studying, and this purpose can be useful in the language learning classroom as well. Reading for 
content information in the language classroom gives students both authentic reading material and an authentic purpose for 
reading.  
•     Reading for cultural knowledge and awareness: Reading everyday materials that are designed for native speakers can give 
students insight into the lifestyles and worldviews of the people whose language they are studying. When students have 
access to newspapers, magazines, and Web sites, they are exposed to culture in all its variety, and monolithic cultural 
stereotypes begin to break down.  
    
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our school uses curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least 
restrictive environment by mainstreaming students whenever a student shows strengths in a specific content area. This is 
possible due to grade level teachers planning together to ensure that the entire grade (general ed. Teachers and special ed. 
Teachers) is meeting the Common Core Learning Standards. Our scheduling is such that content areas are taught at common 
times which promotes mainstreaming.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

By continuously analyzing data from the ELL assessment (NYSITELL, NYSESLAT) and other assessments (DRA, teacher 
observations) throughout the year, we are able to track the progress or lack of progress of the ELLs in our building. By 
identifying their next steps and strengths, we can design our academic intervention services to be more specific and effective, 
and at the same time revise and refine our instructional modalities.  
  
Our Transitional Bilingual and Free-Standing ENL program will offer a supporting structure of scaffolding strategies to ensure 
ENL and academic development. Our ENL classes and content area lessons will be taught using the six main types of 
instructional scaffolding techniques: 
  
•     Modeling 
•     Bridging 
•     Contextualization 
•     Schema building 
•     Text Representation 
•     Meta-cognition 
  
To further enhance the growth of ELLs in literacy, our teachers follow the Core Knowledge Program and Expeditianary 
Learning. These programs provide comprehensive, research-based instruction which is aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards. The programs provide scaffolded teaching strategies, remediation materials, and on-going assessments. Teachers 
use these assessments to diagnose, plan instruction, and monitor progress. In addition, we also provide the following literacy-
based enrichment activities: 
  
•     Dream Yard 
•     Book of the Month 
•     Poem in your Pocket  
•     Project Arts 
•     SETTS (selected students with IEPs) 
    
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

After analyzing our NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, ELA, and Math data, we conclude that our ELL students require additional support in 
the areas of reading and writing. Our ELL students will be included in the After School Program and Saturday Academy. In 
order to support students in the areas of reading, writing, and math, we will use iReady and Coach. Students will take an on-
line diagnostic. The diagnostic results will serve to group the students according to their needs and then teachers will plan 
lessons to meet these needs. 
  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

At this time, we have discontinued Great Leaps, Good Habits Great Readers, and Avenues because these programs were not 
aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. 
  
  
  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
  
Our ELL students are invited and participate in all school programs such as Project Arts, Project MERIT, and Project RAM. This 
participation is not limited to academics. It extends to social events such as Parent and Student Celebrations, Cultural Diversity 
Day, and Parent Engagement in the Arts.

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We have purchased instructional materials to support our ELLs. Every classroom has a smartboard as well as computers and 
ipads. In addition, our school has purchased the following online programs Mathletics, Spellodrome, and MyOn. These online 
programs provide differentiated support for students in the areas of mathematics and literacy. Teachers can assign 
differentiated tasks to students for extra support and practice. In addition, students have the ability to log in from home and 
continue to practice at home. 
  
Our teachers hold parent workshops on these online programs for parents. Teachers help parents register and log into their 
child's account. Parents can get updated emails with their child's progress from these online programs. Teachers model for 
parents the activities their child participates in while logged onto these programs. Translators are available for parents during 
these parent workshops. 
  
   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 
Native language support in Transitional Bilingual and ESL classes is provided in the following ways: 
  
•     Instructions/Directions in the native language 
•     Glossaries 
•     Buddy system 
-            Small group differentiation 
    
  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All of our ELL support services, resources, and materials correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   
  
When ordering materials, we order grade specific materials while considering students needs and levels. Books on the same 
topic but on different reading levels are purchased to accommodate the different stages of language acquisition. 
   
  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We have purchased instructional materials to support our ELLs. Every classroom has a smartboard as well as computers and 
ipads. In addition, our school has purchased the following online programs Mathletics, Spellodrome, and MyOn. These online 
programs provide differentiated support for students in the areas of mathematics and literacy. Teachers can assign 
differntiated tasks to students for extra support and practice. In addition, students have the ability to log in from home and 
continue to practice at home. 
  
Our teachers hold parent workshops on these online programs for parents. Teachers help parents register and log into their 
child's account. Parents can get updated emails with their child's progress from these online programs. Teachers model for 
parents the activities their child participates in while logged onto these programs. Translaters are available for parents during 
these parent workshops. 
  
   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

 

Our parent Coordinator and our Guidance Counselor hold parent/child orientation for newly enrolled ELL students before the 
beginning of the school year. During this orientation, parents/children are welcomed to our school, they view a presentation 
about our school and the Department of Education, Question and answer time, and a tour of our school.

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
As always, professional development will be a priority at our school. Our professional development is geared to address the 
needs of the staff to enhance instructional practices. We utilize at least 50% of the city-wide Monday Professional Learning 
time to address the mandated professional development each school must provide to address the needs of English Language 
Learners. This professional development includes a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language 
and content instruction for English Language Learners. In addition, the required professional development hours are dedicated 
to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching 
strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English Language Learners.  
  
This professional development will also include: 
•     What is the Jose P. consent decree? 
•     CR Part 154 
•     Extension of Services 
•     Language Allocation Policy 
•     How is an ELL student identified? 
•     ELL Programs 
          -Dual

           -CALLA 
           -BICS 
           -CALP   
  
Our ENL instructor, literacy and math coach, and staff developers also provide staff development by modeling lessons, 
conferring with teachers, and assisting with planning lessons. They also arrange for inter-class visitations so teachers are able 
to observe and debrief best instructional practices as they learn from each other. In addition, grade specific educators meet on 
a weekly basis with the coaches and/or staff developers to discuss implementation outcomes, express needs, concerns, and 
plan next steps for the grade (individual teachers) and/or staff development for the next session.  
  
Our ENL teachers and our bilingual teachers attend workshops offered by OELL. The ENL teacher then turn keys pertinent 
information to the rest of the school staff during school based PD. Our teachers participate in grade level meetings with the 
ENL and Bilingual teacher where ELL strategies are discussed and shared. 
  
  
Our school will address these requirements during our Monday Professional Development as well as our grade level meetings 
during the school day. Some of the topics that will be cover include: 
-•     Literacy-rich school environments where students are immersed in a variety of language experiences;  
•     Instruction that develops foundational skills in English and enables ELLs to participate fully in grade-level coursework;  
•     Coursework that prepares ELLs for post secondary education or the workplace, yet is made comprehensible for students 
learning content in a second language (through specific pedagogical techniques and additional resources);  
•     Opportunities for classroom discourse and interaction that are well-designed to enable ELLs to develop communicative 
strengths in language arts;  
•     Ongoing assessment and feedback to guide learning; and  
•     Speakers of English who know the language well enough to provide ELLs with models and  
support.  
•     Language switching can be swift, highly automatic, and facilitate rather than inhibit solving  
word problems in the second language, as long as the student’s language proficiency is  
sufficient for understanding the text of the word problem;  
•     Instruction should ensure that students understand the text of word problems before they  
attempt to solve them;  
•     Instruction should include a focus on “mathematical discourse” and “academic language”  
because these are important for ELLs. Although it is critical that  
•     students who are learning English have opportunities to communicate mathematically, this is not primarily a matter of 
learning vocabulary. Students learn to participate in mathematical reasoning, not by learning vocabulary, but by making 
conjectures, presenting explanations, and/or constructing arguments; and  
•     While vocabulary instruction is important, it is not sufficient for supporting mathematical communication. Furthermore, 
vocabulary drill and practice are not the most effective instructional practices for learning vocabulary. Research has 
demonstrated that vocabulary learning occurs most successfully through instructional environments that are language-rich, 
actively involve students in using language, require that students both understand spoken or written words and also express 
that understanding orally and in writing, and require students to use words in multiple ways over extended periods of time. To 
develop written and oral communication skills, students need to participate in negotiating meaning for mathematical 
situations and in mathematical practices that require output from students.  
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

 

The parent coordinator and the guidance counselor will assist students and parents in the middle school application and 
transition process. They also assist students and parents in becoming familiar with middle school expectations and procedures 
such as departmentalization.  
    
 A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 
154.2 must be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating 
language and content instruction for English language learners. For all bilingual and English as a new language teachers, a 
minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours must be dedicated to language acquisition in 
alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating 
language and content instruction for English language learners.  
  
      Our school will address these requirements during our Monday Professional Development as well as our grade level 
meetings during the school day. Some of the topics that will be cover include: 
- Supporting Ells' Achievement: Oral Language Unpacked 
- Academic Language 
- Vocabulary Unpacked 
- Scaffolding 
- Distinguishing Language Acquisition from Learning Disabilities 
- Text Complexity 
- Disciplinary Literacy for ELLs  
  
Records of agendas and attendance are kept for professional development activities on file in an ELL folder of critical 
documents maintained in the principal's office. 
  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
  
Parents are invited to parent/teacher meetings on Parent Outreach Tuesdays. On Tuesday's parents are invited to attend 
parent workshops and one-on-one meetings to discuss curriculum, expectations, data, strengths/needs, goals of the program, 
language development progress, language proficiency assessment results and language development needs in content areas. 
  
In the case where the parent is unable to attend the Tuesday Parent Outreach meeting, teachers avail themselves of time 
during their prep. to meet with the parents. 
    

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Response to Question 2 - A record of all parent meetings is kept on file with either the Parent Coordinator or the school

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Carlos Velez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The following data and methodologies were utilized to determine parents’ preferred language of communication: 

- School report card data 

- Parent surveys 

- Oral translation request 

- Emergency Blue card information

ATS Reports: 

- Home language survey (HLIS) 

- Home Language Report (RHLA) 

- Parents Preferred Language Report (RCPL) 

- Adult Information Report (RADL) 

- Adult Preferred language report (RAPL) 

 

The home language survey is filed in each student's cumulative record. The emergency contact cards are 
organized in binders in the main office. 

According to our RAPL report, Spanish is the largest requested language and is easily covered by in-house staff. 
Other languages covered by in-house staff include Albanian, Italian, Hindi, Urdu, and Korean. For speakers of 
languages not previously mentioned, the staff utilizes the Language Line number to access their preferred 
language.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of an emergency, we have the follwowing procedures in place: 

1) Mass calls will be made to parents via Black Board Connect. Messages will be translated. 

2) Staff members are available to translate for parents.  

3) Each teacher has an emergency folder that includes:  

- A class roster of their students' names, parents' preferred language, and contact numbers 

- Three Step Flyer to access the Language Line in the event of an emergency 

- General Response Protocols 

 

At the beginning of each school year, we ask that all teachers familiarize themselves with the preferred language of 
their students' families. In addition, all school staff will be trained on how to use the language line. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

The chancellor's regulation A-663 will be distributed and discussed with the staff in September. Staff will be made 
aware of translation services for parents. 

 

A school wide PD will be held for school staff on language access or outreach to inform staff on language access 
requirements and resources.  

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)

A copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities regarding translation and interpretation services is shared with 
the parents. In addition, our school posts near the primary entrance a sign in each of the covered languages/most 
prominent covered languages, indicating the availability of interpretation services available for parents. 

 

Staff use Language Line to let the parents know that they can speak to school staff in their preferred language. This 
will allow staff to access 200 plus languages so they can speak to all parents regardless of preferred language. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Gathering feedback from the parents is critical to improve communication. We continuously monitor parent needs via 
parent surveys. After the surveys have been collected and reviewed we look for patterns of need and make the 
necessary adjustments.
