Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our MISSION is Learning today to lead tomorrow! We envision that through clear and consistent academic 
supportive feedback students will become independent and responsible community members that will lead to a 
successful generation of leaders.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Sheridan Academy for Young Leaders (S.A.Y.L.) is an elementary school located in the Morrisania section of the 
Bronx, New York. Beginning September 2009, S.A.Y.L. began serving students in grades K-2 and was fully phased-in by 
2012. S.A.Y.L is one of two schools occupying the George Meany Campus; the other is The Family School. The George 
Meany Campus is a four-story structure that occupies an entire city square block with an annex building which is 
solely occupied by the Family School. S.A.Y.L. serves an average of 600 students in grades K-5. 

Instructional Focus: If teachers ‘step back’ and allow students to productively struggle then students will tap into the 
mental resources to independently complete tasks.

The PBIS Matrix is used to monitor student behavior and PBIS is employed by all teachers and Mascot –Leo, along 
with the use of “Sheridan Dollars” to reward positive behavior. Run by student leaders - The Daily Town Hall 
communicates our mission and vision and serves as a form of communication for the entire learning community. 

AREA OF CELEBRATION: 

Satisfactory progress was made in this area as 98.3% of all students completed the four TCRWP unit task. As per the 
scores on the Iready and SAMS overall school progress spreadsheet, the number of students scoring a level 2 
(developing) in their writing decreased from 87.7% in their Beginning of Year Assessment to 29.2% in their last unit. 
In addition, highly effective ratings in designing coherent instruction increased from 0 at the beginning of the 
school year to 4.55% at the end of the school year. Teachers were consistently observed, coached, and modeled for 
throughout the school year and were provided with feedback that was concrete, manageable, measurable, and 
timely. Ongoing meetings were held with grade teams to discuss and develop lesson plans, curriculum, student 
work products, and instructional practices. These meetings were held in addition to the post observation meetings. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our school has approximately 124 ENL students and approximately 85 students with IEP's. Their needs range from 
vocabulary development and language acquisition to modified promotional criteria, 504 plans, and SETSS. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.

The consistency of the instructional focus and the shared understanding across the school can be seen in various 
ways:

1. Shared expectation that each student has the ability to take ownership of his or her questioning and discussion 
during teacher team meetings; Professional development support around questioning and discussion embedded in 
collaborative teacher teams throughout the year.  

2. Professional collaboration, including reflecting on student performance and teacher practice to monitor work 
around questioning and discussion specifically peer observations and actionable feedback after labsites.  

and, 

3. Student discussions in the classroom will focus on the use of academic vocabulary measured by the student writing 
displayed throughout the school via turn and talk or think pair share.  

Every classroom will show a clear emphasis on using assessments, questioning and discussion, demonstrating 
knowledge of content evidenced by student writing. All students will be engaged in whole-class discussions and 
collaborative conversation with diverse partners, which support them in meeting the speaking and listening Common 
Core Standards for K-5. Around the school there are many visual supports around productive struggle and close 
reading strategy.  

For example, when students are having discussions with their partners, they will and can use sentence starters and 
the ILS protocol. The lenses will help create the turn and talks and think pair shares around discussion in the 
classroom. Another type of visual support that will be seen in classrooms and hallways is a display of the students’ 
wondering around a topic. The questions from the students help the teachers determine their plans for the unit based 
on students’ background knowledge and interest.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
During the 2018-2019 school year, we will continue to implement systems for monitoring curriculum and teacher 
pedagogy aligned with the professional development to ensure that instruction is rigorous, customized, inclusive, and 
aligned to the Common Core state standards.  

DATA TRENDS 

Across the grades, basic foundation skills relating to the Numbers and Operations strand, are paramount to increasing 
performance in the area of Mathematics. In grades K – 2 (lower grades), the concept of ‘subitizing’ has displayed itself 
to be a central focus. Our student’s inability to break numbers apart and to visualize number sense without counting 
by ones is a critical skill, which is a precursor to successfully adding and subtracting numbers. In grades 3 – 5 (upper 
grades) the area of focus is fractions. Giving students time to productively struggle helps identify areas of deficiency 
and supports the work as mentioned in the book Five Mathematical Practices for Orchestrating Productive 
Mathematical Discussions by Margret Schwann Smith and Mary Kay Stein. 

Improvements in the area of Literacy will be realized from analyzing and identifying the ‘gist’ of different text types. 
Allowing students time to productively struggle to accomplish this task is critical. The work centered around this ideal 
will be supported by features in the book, Falling in Love with Close Reading by Christopher Lehman.  

Teacher teams will continue to analyze student work products and analyze curriculum to ensure their instructional 
strategies are aligned to the needs of the students and that instruction is impacting the teaching and learning 
evidenced in the classroom. Providing students with the actionable feedback that would elevate the students’ 
performance and to continue to make necessary adjustments to the curriculum on an ongoing basis. The inquiry 
based teacher team system will focus on refining instructional practices and ensure student progress is evident for all 
populations serve. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.

By June 2019, Sheridan Academy for Young Leaders will continue strategic implementation of research based 
instructional approaches and strategies across all content areas to ensure all students, especially targeted subgroups 
have access to rigorous instruction. This will result in equitable instructional practices that improve achievement for all 
students measured by a 3-5% increase in NYSESLAT, ELA/Math State Assessments, Measures of Student Learning 
(MOSL), MPPR and Quality Review Ratings.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Based on Quality Review Recommendations, ‘the school needs to continue to ensure that all staff members 
understand how to create and sustain high levels of family engagement by developing strong parent partnerships. We 
need to expand the current practices to include professional development for parents that provide strategies they can 
use at home to support their child’s academic needs. We will also act upon the Chancellor’s Initiative to run campus 
based parent learning sessions in conjunction with the partnering school with which we share the campus. 

Strengths: At the Sheridan Academy we include parents in all aspects of our educational and social plans. Our School 
Leadership team, along with our Parent Teachers Association, welcome parent involvement and input as evidenced by 
the 98% participation of parents in the 2018 School Survey and 95% satisfaction rate with our Instructional Core and 
School Culture. We offer parent workshops on a variety of topics such as the Common Core Learning Standards, 
supporting students at home, preparing students for the NYSESLAT, ELA and Math state exams, bullying prevention, 
safety, how to handle difficult children, and a variety of other topics. Communication is paramount and we send home 
a monthly newsletter, School leadership team bulletin Board, calendar and flyers reminding parents about our school 
events and professional learning.  

By June 2019, using a variety of outreach strategies and the Tuesday parent engagement time, visitation and 
participation in parent workshops will increase by 20% as compared to year ending 2018.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

Reflections: Based on the Quality Review recommendation for 2018-2019, we will continue to implement systems for 
monitoring social and emotional developmental health needs. These adaptive measures are implemented specific to 
individual student’ needs when growth is not actualized. This will create a clear link between students’ social and 
emotional development and success attaining school level achievement, aligned with the schools vision for a healthy 
and safe environment. 

Strengths: The School Quality Data from 2017 - 2018 Community Ties, compared to the citywide average of 91%.  

Needs Improvement: While our responses are very close and even exceed the citywide average on two of four 
measures, our efforts still require attention to ensure that we are providing the most supportive environment 
possible for our students. In addition, the administration will be partnering with the school guidance department 
placing emphasis on social and emotional interventions promoting personal /academic behaviors, peer interactions, 
press toward academic achievement and classroom professionalism. The school is recommitted to infusing the Seven 
Habits of Highly Effective People into the school culture. Monthly meetings (SIT Team and Teachers) will look closely 
at and monitor student behavior. Stronger parent-school partnerships are needed to provide parents with the 
necessary skills to support the students at home. Teacher feedback to be reviewed after professional development 
sessions. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, Sheridan Academy for Young Leaders will have created and executed an Equity Goal and action plan, 
which emphasizes the creation of a more culturally responsive learning environment supported by strategic systems,

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on the 2018 strengths and needs. We must also ensure that all teachers use student performance data to 
develop individual action plans to support individual learning needs and provide differentiated and academic 
intervention support. 

Strengths: With dedicated PD time each Monday after school, teachers are able to focus more on specific areas of 
development that are relevant to their current teaching practice and desired areas of growth. Both teachers and 
school leaders report that the hands-on role of teachers in designing and delivering PD has increased the overall 
effectiveness of the PD program. The administration has noticed improvements in teacher performance over time, 
based on qualitative data from teacher observations MOTP report from Advance. 

Sheridan Academy for Young Leader’s approach to PD has also had a profound effect on school culture. By instituting 
quarterly conferences for discussions of professional growth, administration has encouraged a school culture that 
empowers teachers to communicate to the support staff resulting in a school of trust, collaboration, and more 
distributive leadership. Additionally, because teachers receive personalized support based on their actual observation 
data, they have become much more tuned into grade and teacher PLC specific development opportunities. This has 
led to objective next steps which has enabled them to look beyond the evaluative aspects of Advance and focus on 
the development opportunities the system presents. 

Teacher teams made strides last year in establishing refined protocols and practicing their use to ensure effective 
implementation in the current year. This year’s focus will be to master the TCRWP curriculum, revise units of study or 
activities and assessments to ensure the progress of all students being served.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, Sheridan Academy for Young Leaders will continue to deepen professional learning and collaborative 
practices that support all learners and will participate in inter-school inquiry based partnerships coordinated by the 
District 9 Learning Partner Initiative. This will result in sharing of equitable practices that support all learners and will be 
measured through improvement in Advance Measures of Teacher performance overall ratings, leadership metrics, as 
well as the annual school survey. June 2019, 100% of the instructional staff will participate in learning activities 
sanctioned by the Professional Development Committee that improves pedagogy specific to teacher needs. This will be 
measured by a minimum overall increase of 5% in teacher Advance (MOTP) ratings in the components of 2 and 3.

there is a lack of volunteer leadership. The Scoutreach after-school program has a proven track record in over 53 
public schools located in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan. The program has a proven track record 
designed to help to foster self-mastery, and develops new interests and skills through fitness and citizenship training 
in a fun, interactive environment. Boys learn about accountability and responsibility to themselves, their families and 
their communities. 

Leadership in the Scoutreach program is provided by our trained program specialists, primarily college students who 
serve in the traditional roles of Cubmaster, Den Leader, etc... 

Strategic partnerships such as this enables Scoutreach to help facilitate the Boy Scouts of America’s commitment to 
ensure that youth have an opportunity to join Scouting, regardless of their circumstances, neighborhood, or ethnic 
background.

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
We attend teacher fairs to recruit teachers or other pedagogues and hiring all teachers will be done by the hiring 
committee which consists of teachers and administration. All teachers will provide instruction in ELA and Math in 
their license areas during the school day, after school and Saturday programs. Teachers will be given continual 
professional development on The Danielson Framework, creating effective Common Core Learning Standards-aligned 
lesson plans and time management strategies. The school extended cabinet will conduct monthly meetings and 
appointed mentors will meet weekly with the new teachers to provide support and build trust. Quality professional 
development to ensure staff is highly skilled will be provided on an ongoing basis throughout the school year. The 
professional developments will include but is not limited to: 

 

1. New Teacher Center District Nine Initiative for dedicated school based mentor 

2. Workshops for teachers on track for tenure

2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Throughout the 2018 school year, SETSS , ENL and GE teachers will participate in vertical common planning and 
discussion. Our Literacy Program continues to be an area of focus so increasing the amount and quality of 
professional development for the staff is a necessity. Over the last several years we have gradually focused on the 
main components of the Balanced Literacy approach and we continue to focus on close reading and have allocated 
funding for additional reading materials and professional development specifically 210,000 dollars for classroom 
Libraries and teacher's college coaches . For the 2018-2019 school year in literacy, math, and special education with a 
focus on the social emotional and students with disabilities and ENL English Native Language strategies. Due to the 
percentage of Students with Special Needs at Sheridan, we have a large number of paraprofessionals and we 
recognize the vital role they play in the classroom, therefore we insist that they participate alongside their teacher 
colleagues in all applicable professional development opportunities as well as provide professional learning 
opportunities by identifying capacity builders. 

 

In an effort to build upon our teacher leaders, build capacity within our school and tap into individual strengths we 
also encourage teacher led professional development activities designed by our extended cabinet with an emphasis 
on lesson and unit planning aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. Inter-school instructional rounds as well 
as Central led professional developments, will be attended throughout the school year. Our focus on mathematics 
instruction and refining the expertise in this area for our departmentalized teachers will continue with the support of 
our C. King Mathematics consultant. 

 

Because we know that professional development does not begin and end with the teachers, and education is an ever 
evolving industry the administration, office staff, parent coordinator, family workers and school aides will also 
continue to attend professional developments. Assistant principals will attend off site professional development 
alongside teachers; principal led professional development, and ELL/ELI workshops. Principal will also offer and 
provide a variety of professional development for teachers based on the needs assessed by coaches, consultants, 
teachers and administration actionable feedback.

selected to select Default Measures of Student Learning. Members of the MOSL committee discuss all options with 
staff and a collective decision is made as to what assessments should be selected to assess student progress and 
teacher practice. Teachers received professional development resources from the district on the administration of the 
exam and coaches provided professional development norming how to use the rubrics for NYC performance 
assessments with fidelity. Professional development on how to use data from these assessments for future planning 
has been and will continue to be provided by the MOSL coach assigned to our school as well as the Achievement 
Coach. Teachers will also continue to develop authentic real world assessments as they plan their curriculum units 
which will include rubrics and checklists.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-

quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Sheridan Academy For Young Leaders ,09X457, in compliance with the Section 
1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students

The school’s Parent Involvement 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home; 

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

  Sheridan Academy For Young Leaders (SAYL)BEFORE, AFTER, AND SATURDAY 
ACADEMY Programs  
              At the Sheridan Academy for Young Leaders(SAYL),  our students are diverse and this 
diversity has a profound impact on our school culture. The student population at SAYL consists 
of 69.3% Hispanic,  28.5% Black/African, .63% White,  1.05% Asian, and 0.21% Multi-racial. 
Our ENL students make up 22% of our student population. 
             Our overriding new goal is to maintain high expectations for all our ENL and Immigrant 
students.  We strive to provide them with high quality instruction that is rigorous  and 
intensive.  We have designed an  intensive Saturday Academy program targeting ENL and 
immigrant students.  This program is based on  NYSESLAT  performance levels and the Fountas 
and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System.  to maintain high expectations for all our ENLs; in 
effect, we strive to provide them with high quality instruction. With this in mind, we have 
designed a rigorous and intensive After School Program and Saturday Academy program 
targeting ENLs, based on their performance on the NYSESLAT and the Fountas and Pinnell 
Benchmark Assessment System. 
             The targeted group for the After School Program includes:  third, fourth, fifth graders 
performing at the  transitioning  and expanding  levels of English proficiency as determined by 
the 2018 NYSESLAT scores.  The Newcomers' group consists of students  in grades three, four, 
and five performing at the entering and emerging levels of English proficiency as determined by 
their NYSITELL scores. The teaching staff  for the After School Program consists of two 
certified ENL teachers and one certified Bilingual teacher. The After School Program will take 
place during the following days and hours: Wednesday and Thursday from 2:25 - 5:00 PM. The 
program will run from October ,  2018 until  March , 2019. It will consist of 35 sessions. 
Moreover, the After School Program includes  one third/fourth grade class, one fifth grade class, 
and one class especially designed for newcomers. Each class will have approximately 12 to 15 
students. 
             The teaching staff for the Saturday Academy program will consist of three certified ENL 
or Bilingual teachers. The Saturday Academy program will run from November 2018 to April , 
2019. There will be a total of 18 instructional and 2 planning sessions  for a total of 20 sessions. 
The hours will be  8:30 am-12:30 pm. There will be  one kindergarten class, one first grade, and 
one second grade class. Each class will have about 10 to 15 students. 
            Our  instructional focus for the After School program and the Saturday Academy is to 
provide instruction designed to move students in the continuum of language proficiency levels, 
and to improve their academic skills. Furthermore, our teaching staff will provide quality 
instruction to our ELLs with a focus on the four modalities of language acquisition: listening, 
speaking, reading, and writing. In order to make content comprehensible, the teachers will use 
scaffolding strategies to facilitate  student learning.  The language of instruction for the after 
school program and Saturday Academy will be English. However, the newcomers will need 
home language support in order to acquire English. Since, all the newcomers' native language is 
Spanish; the teacher who will be teaching the newcomers class will be bilingual  so that she can 
offer support in the students' native language (Spanish). Growth in students will be measured by

their performance on the 2018 NYSESLAT  and the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment 
System.  Moreover, the parents of English language learners will receive  letters in their 
preferred languages to inform them about the programs.  The letters will also serve as permission 
slips to invite the ENLs  to the , Before After, and Saturday school  programs. Each teacher will 
take attendance during each session. The attendance sheets and the permission slips will be kept 
in a binder in the main office. 
              The Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT from Attanasio and Associates will be 
purchased to prepare the students for the NYSESLAT. The Getting Ready for the 
NYSESLAT books are supplemental materials that will not be used in daily instruction. In 
addition, the following grades will use Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT: Kindergarten, first, 
second, third, fourth, and fifth. Our teachers were offered and attended professional development 
with a focus on the use and implementation of the instructional programs. Using the Getting 
Ready for the NYSESLAT, English Language Learners will take on higher-level comprehension 
skills and develop a deeper analysis of text at every grade level. Writing and conversations about 
books will be evidence-based, and academic vocabulary will be learned in all content areas. 
Personal narratives, while still an effective  form of writing, will lead to more informational text. 
              The students will engage in the following activities: in speaking, the students will 
formulate letter-sound relationships (K and 1); visualize, activate prior knowledge; answer in 
complete sentences; have strategies for unknown words; use correct grammar while answering 
questions; and know and use grade-level vocabulary.  In listening, the students will acquire 
appropriate grade level vocabulary; follow directions; separate extraneous and useful 
information; identify main idea and details; and identify and comprehend idiomatic expressions. 
In reading, the students will develop phonemic awareness/decoding; activate prior knowledge; 
make text-to-text and text-to-self connections; and read and comprehend in English on grade 
level.  In writing, the students will develop a voice; edit; reread for meaning; use correct sentence 
structure, utilize a graphic organizer; and use use appropriate grammar and punctuation. 
Furthermore, the teachers and students will use the Individual Student Progress Chart that will 
allow them to see the progress being  made on a particular set or subset. 
              Teachers in the Saturday Academy program will use the Orton-Gillingham, an 
instructional approach designed to help newcomers and struggling readers acquire and master the 
basic knowledge about language and its relationship to our writing system.  The materials 
required to teach the Orton-Gillingham approach have already been purchased and are already 
being used in daily instruction in most classrooms.Teachers teaching the lower grades (K-2) will 
allot 40 minutes to an hour to teach phonics using the Orton-Gillingham approach. Children will 
learn the letters of the alphabet and their corresponding sounds. As children learn the alphabet, 
they will also learned the rules associated with the letters to aid them in writing words. the 
sequence of the lessons will be as follow:alphabet->Vowels->Vowels vs Consonants-> concept 
of long and short vowels-> CVC-> cognates->CCVC, etc. As students master one skill, they will 
move to the next level.

  Parent Engagement Activities 
    At the Sheridan Academy for Young Leaders, parent engagement is one of our main priorities. 
In effect, we offer outreach to the parents of our English language learners through letters, fliers, 
announcements, and Title III letters (translated in the parents' preferred languages) on a regular 
basis. 
 Moreover, our parent coordinator, Mr. Cedano  meets and communicates with the parents on a 
daily basis. Every morning, Mr. Cedano makes himself available  to answer questions and 
concerns regarding any issue that the parents may have about their children's education. If Mr. 
Cedano is unable to  address the parents' concerns, he  refers the parents to an administrator 
and/or teachers who can assist the parents. In addition to that, we have been using and continue 
to use the UFT Parent Engagement periods on Tuesday afternoons to meet with parents to 
discuss student progress and  academic expectations.  The parent coordinator and  our School's 
PA president act in concert with the administrative team, The ENL coordinator,  ENL teachers, 
and guidance counselors to find ways to better serve the parents of ENLs in our community. In 
addition, agendas,  attendance sheets, and invitation to parents in their preferred languages will 
be maintained  by the parent coordinator, Mr. Cedano will provide the Spanish translation during 
the workshops. However, Mr. Cedano will use the services of the Translation and Interpretation 
Unit to have two on-site interpreters available to assist the parents who speak Bengali, and 
Arabic.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
5, our school uses the Fountas and Pinnell program. It is used to determine baseline reading levels as well as monitor ongoing 
progress.  A baseline writing assessment is also used to determine the students' basic writing skills. For our students enrolled 
in the dual language program, we use the Fountas and Pinnell (Spanish version). In addition, the NYSESLAT 
, NYSITELL, iReadyEstrellita, TCRWP assessment  results are also utilized to specifically assess ELLs; in fact, they present a broad 
view of students' performance in the four spectrums of Reading, Writing, Listening and Speaking. 
mentioned assessments, we have determined the following: in the areas of Listening and Speaking, our students are 
performing at the Entering, Emerging, Tansitioning and Expanding levels of proficiency; while in the areas of Reading and 
Writing they are mostly Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning and very few are Expanding . The results of the data help inform 
our instructional plan and prescribes the need for a strong balanced literacy program.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teachers will be engaged in Professional development focusing on lesson planning and the implementation of ESL ( e.g. QTEL) 
strategies to support ENL students.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 We have been using the results of the NYSESLAT to measure progress in Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking. We also 
use the Fountas and Pinnell assessment kit, as well as teacher- made formative and summative assessments to measure 
progress. We expect to see students gain a proficiency level from year to year and to eventually reach proficiency and test 
out.     
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Small group instruction by Orton Gillingham and Estrellita Teachers 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
  The Sheridan Academy for Young Leaders (PS 457x) uses data in a strategic way to instructionally support English Language 
Learners.  The school engages in progressive data collection throughout the year using assessments aligned to the Common 
Core Learning Standards.  In the area of English Language Arts the Sheridan Academy uses the Fountas and Pinnell Reading 
Assessment system for grades K-2 and  IReady Reading Assessment to assess literacy skills of students in grades  3-5.  The 
school uses these programs to track student progress in the reading areas of: 
•     phoneomic awareness 
•     decoding 
•     Accuracy 
•     Fluency 
•     Comprehension 
  
Sheridan Academy uses a progress monitoring benchmark tool to determine the aptitude levels of its students.  Based on this 
tool, we assess our entire student body three times a year.  If students are not performing at or above grade level during any 
time of the standard reading assessment periods, they are additionally assessed to further identify, track, and remediate 
deficiencies in reading.  ELL students in our self-contained classes are closely monitored and receive added support as needed 
in small groups, by an additional ENL teacher or a certified bilingual teacher.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 The data from the NYSESLAT and the NYSITELL reveal that in the areas of Listening and Speaking, our students are performing 
on theEntering,  Emerging,  Transitioning and Expanding levels of proficiency; while in the areas of Reading and Writing they 
are Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The administration meets with teachers and grade level teacher teams to review student performance using formative and 
summative data sources.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 1a. We use the push-in model to implement integrated ENL and stand-alone instruction. The ENL teachers work in 
concert with the classroom teacher to plan lessons. However, the ENL teachers use effective research-based ESL/ENL 
strategies to make content comprehensible for the students. These strategies increase comprehension, learning, and 
interaction through modeling, acting out, gesturing, showing diagrams, and doing hands-on activities and 
experiments.  In addition to that, the ENL teachers and the classroom teachers have opted to use a parallel  co-
teaching apprach to  deliver ENL intruction. For example, the classroom teacher teaches the non- ELLs in one group 
while the ENL teacher provide instruction to the ELLs. The students from grades 2-5 are grouped heterogeneously 
based on their proficiency levels. For instance, fourth and fifth grades, the students performing at the Transitioning 
and Expanding level of proficiency are grouped together to receive 180 minutes a week of  ENL instruction. Our 
students who are performing at the Entering and Emerging level of proficiency are grouped in the same class to 
receive 360 minutes a week of ENL intruction.  Futhermore, the students who have tested out of ENL in the past two 
years are grouped homogeneously to receive 90 minutes on Integrated ENL services weekly.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

We do not have a Transitional Bilingual Education program this year.   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

In our Dual Language program, we use a 50/50 model.  We have two dual language classes in Kindergarten and  two 
dual language classes in first grade.  One teacher teaches in English while the other teacher teaches in Spanish.  The 
children travel  between the two classes depending on the day. The curriculum is presented bilngually and is divided 
into distinct blocks of time; for example, day one in English, day two in Spanish, day three in English, etc.  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

            At Sheridan, we currently have 114 ELLs. They are divided into groups  and they are serviced by the two program 
models: Dual Language and  Integrated ENL. 
• In the Dual Language programs, we have 26 ELLs in kindergarten and first grade who are serviced by 2 certified bilingual 
teachers. 
• In the Integrated ENL Program, we have 88 ELLs being serviced by two certified ESL teachers and one bilingual teacher, using 
Push-in  model. In the Integrated ENL Program (K-5th Grade) instruction is delivered according to the mandated number of 
instructional minutes. Students receive: 
Entering =2 units of integrated and standalone  ENL (360 minutes) per week 
Emerging =2 units of integrated and standalone ENL (360 minutes) per week. 
Transitioning=1 unitof integrated  ENL (180 minutes) per week. 
Expanding= 1Unit of integrated ENL (180 minutes) per week. 
Commanding=  .5 unit of integrated ENL (90 minutes) per week. 
  
In our Dual Language program, we use a 50/50 model.  We have two dual language classes in Kindegarten and  two dual 
language classes in first grade.  One teacher teaches in English while the other teacher teaches in Spanish.  The children 
travel  between the two classes depending on the day. The curriculum is presented bilngually and is divided into distinct blocks 
of time; for example, day one in English, day two in Spanish, day three in English, etc.  
  
2a. Free-Standing Integrated and standalone  ENL (Push-In) Model : 
At Sheridan Academy we work on a 50 minute block of instruction. ELLs performing at the Entering and Emerging levels of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

proficiency are serviced for a period of 100 minutes per day/4 days a week with a total of 400 minutes per week, while 
students performing at the Transitioning and Expanding  levels of proficiency are serviced for 50 minutes per day/4 days a 
week with a total of 200 minutes per week. We are surpassing the mandated daily minutes of ENL instruction to our ELL 
population. Using ENL methodology and strategies, we address the four modalities of language acquisition: Listening, 
SpeakingBased Learning; Cooperative Learning; Information Processing, the ReadyGen Program, and Teaching Matters 
program to foster literacy independence. 
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   At Sheridan, we currently have 114 ELLs. They are divided into groups and they are serviced by the two program models: 
Dual Language and  Free-Standing. 
2a. Free-Standing ENL (Push-In) Model : 
At Sheridan Academy we work on a 50 minute block of instruction. ELLs performing on the Beginner and Intermediate levels of 
proficiency are serviced for a period of 100 minutes per day/4 days a week with a total of 400 minutes per week, while 
students performing at the Advanced level of proficiency are serviced for 50 minutes per day/4 days a week with a total of 200 
minutes per week. We are surpassing the mandated daily minutes of ESL instruction to our ELL population. Using ESL 
methodology and strategies, we address the four modalities of language acquisition; Listening, SpeakingBased Learning; 
Cooperative Learning; Information Processing, the ReadyGen Program to foster literacy independence. 
  
Dual Language Model: 
In our Dual Language program, we use a 50/50 model.  We have two dual language classes in Kindegarten and  two dual 
language classes in first grade.  One teacher teaches in English while the other teacher teaches in Spanish.  The children 
travel  between the two classes depending on the day. The curriculum is presented bilngually and is divided into distinct blocks 
of time; for example, day one in English, day two in Spanish, day three in English, etc. The certified ENL teacher uses the ENL 
methodology and strategies. As a matter of fact, the teacher addresses the four modalilities of language acquisition; Listening, 
SpeakingBased Learning, Cooperative Learning, Information Processing, and the Readygen Program to foster literacy 
independence.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   We appropirately evaluate our Spanish speaking ELLs who are in the dual language classes by using the Fountas and Pinnell in 
Spanish to assess them in their native languages.  However, for the other languages, Mandingo, French, Twi, Fulani, Bengali 
and other languages, we do not offer any assessment.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 6a. We do not have any SIFE students this year. 
  
6b.We have an intensive After School Program for Newcomers. This program services the ELLs in small groups (11max. 
per/class) for 3 hours/two days a week and will run from November 2017 until April 2019. We will also hold a  Title III Saturday 
Academy which will begin  in November 2017prolonged approach in an effort to address the four modalities of language 
acquisition; Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing. 
• ESL/ENL methodology is used to make content comprehensible, including phonics instruction, sight vocabulary, as well as 
teaching content-specific vocabulary. We also use the Total Physical Response approach as well as modeling during instruction 
to enhance comprehension. To top it off, visuals are also displayed on the classroom walls to foster language acquisition. 
visual technology is also utilized, in building/enhancing grade level appropriate skills that students may be lacking.

• A variety of authentic assessment procedures are periodically utilized (including portfolios, rubrics, performance-based 
assessment) to assess ELLs and to evaluate learning styles, strengths and strategies. In addition, we also use the Fountas and 
Pinnell program, to determine baseline Reading levels as well as monitor ongoing progress. Furthermore, to determine their 
baseline writing skills, a Baseline Writing assessment is also conducted. The various assessments are geared toward improving 
instructional methodology and student performance; both in their regular classrooms and on the NYSESLAT exam. 
• On the whole, a balanced literacy approach is used in teaching our ELLs. This ensures that they don’t miss out on any skills 
that their fellow native English Language speakers may be acquiring/may have acquired. At Sheridan, our ESL/ENL program is 
implemented with the goal of not only having students pass the NYSESLAT exam, but also equipping ELLs with the language 
and scholastic skills that they need to succeed academically. 
  
6c. Supplementary support is provided in small groups using differentiated instruction for our ELLs that have received service 4 
to 6 years.  We have started an intensive After-School program, tailored to their needs, with the goal of helping them reach 
English-proficiency on the NYSESLAT test. This program services the ELLs in small groups (11max. per/class) for 3 hours/three 
days a week and runs from November 2017 until April 2019 The focus is on Reading Comprehension and Writing, using 
NYSESLAT Test Prep, Writing, and Reading, as ESL/Literacy program. In addition, we also started a Title III Saturday Academy in 
November 2017 for all ELLs. The program will run for 4 1/2  hours, every Saturday, for a period of 15 weeks. The focus will be 
on quality instruction using ESL/ENL methodology and strategies to improve Reading and Writing. We will cover all content 
areas ensuring an alignment with the Common Core Standards. 
  
6d. Supplementary support is provided in small groups using differentiated instruction for our four long-term ELLs.  We have 
started an intensive After-School program, tailored to their needs, with the goal of getting them to English-proficiecy on the 
NYSESLAT exam.  This program services the ELLs in small groups (11max. per/class) for 3 hours/three days a week and runs 
until April 2014.  The focus is on Reading Comprehension and Writing, using the Finish Line for ELLs, Writing, and Reading, as 
ESL/ Literacy program.  In addition, we will also be starting a Title III Saturday Academy in November 2014 for all ELLs.  The 
program will run for 4 hours, every Saturday, for a period of 10 weeks.  The focus will be on quality instruction using ESL 
methodology and strategies to improve Reading and Writing.  We will cover all content areas ensuring an alignment with the 
Common Core Standar. 
  
pronged approach, we address the four modalities of language acquisition; Listening, SpeakingBased Learning; Cooperative 
Learning; and Information Processing. We also differentiate instruction using small groups and through independent activities. 
The former ELLs will also be invited to attend the After School  and Title III Saturday Academy Programs  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 To provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development, teachers use various ESL 
strategies which include scaffolding, use of graphic organizers, visuals, glossaries, laptops for reading and writing. This is in 
addition to the traditional strategies used to teach  ELLs and Special Education students. To meet the diverse needs of ELL-
SWD, the teachers make sure that the students receive modified instruction tailored to meet their IEP goals through the 
Reading and Writing program Teaching Matters.  ELLs with special needs are assessed based on the annual goals and  testing 
accommodations stated on their IEPs. In addition, ELLs with special needs are given specific, direct and intensive remedial 
instruction. In fact, the lessons are specific, directed, and intensive remedial instruction designed to help the students meet 
their annual goals. ELLs identified as having special needs are given modified instruction and assessed based on their IEP goals 
and testing modifications.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 A concerted effort is made  to prepare ELL-SWD for success in the least restrictive environment.   Content area teachers are 
provided with some content materials which support all student learning by providing rigorous curriculum as is mandated by 
CCLS.  Classes are scheduled to go into the computer lab or have laptops and iPads brought to the classroom for accessing 
online content.  Accommodations are made by teachers to ensure maximum benefit of the instructional time in the 
class.   Also, Teachers work collaboratively to plan a coherent curriculum across the grades. Moreover, teachers are provided

with double preparation time weekly to analyze the students' data. Teachers group students based on their academic needs by 
targeting and accommodating their learning styles.  Students in need of more tactile activity are grouped accordingly. Teachers 
also use the guided reading and guided math approach within the ELA and math block.     
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
term ELLs based on their performance on the NYSESLAT. This program services the ELLs in small groups (11max. per/class) for 3 
hours/three days a week and runs from Noveber 2017 until April 2019. Our focus is to help them achieve English proficiency on 
the NYSESLAT test this year. We concentrate on building/enhancing Reading Comprehension and Writing skills, using Finish 
Line for Ells, Reading, and Writing, as ESL/Literacy program. We also started a Title III Saturday Academy in November 2013 for 
all ELLs. The program will run for 4 hours, every Saturday, for a period of 12 weeks. The focus will be on Reading and Writing. 
In math, social studies and science, we will implement interdisciplinary lesson as mandated by state requirements during the 
instructional day and extended time through an aftershcool program. All intervention services are provided in English. Our 
overarching goal is to accelerate English proficiency within a three year period, while  improving overall academic 
performance.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We have purchased three different programs to enhance literacy skills in all our students: Words Their Way, Time for Kids, and 
Teaching Matters for the whole school. To increase the effectiveness of our Dual Language program, our school has purchased 
new kits to enhance language and comprehension skills in content areas; we are looking into enhancing our leveled classroom 
libraries (Spanish), content libraries (Spanish), leveled Science sets (Spanish), as well as a purchasing a Dual language Math 
collection. These programs are all aligned with the Core Curriculum Standards.     
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

 We do not plan to discontinue any of our programs/services for ELLs    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 We offer our ELLs equal access to all school programs, including extended day classes, art program, gardening, sports 
program, cookshop classes, and the student council. Also, ELLs are invited to an intensive After School Program that  will begin 
in November 2017servicing the ELLs in small groups (11max. per/class) for 3 hours/three days a week and runs until April 2019. 
Moreover, we will  invite them in a Title III Saturday Academy that will begin in November 2017. The program will run for 4 
hours, every Saturday, for a period of 12 weeks. The focus will be on quality instruction using ESL methodology and strategies 
to improve Reading and Writing. We will cover all content areas ensuring an alignment with the Common Core Standards.     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
s, On Our Way to English, a resource that covers the four spectrums of language acquisition, Reading, Listening, Speakingbased 
classroom resource designed to teach students how to work with informational texts; students learn about features of 
informational texts and are taught how to write and respond to such texts.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In our Dual Language program, we use a 50/50 model.  We have two dual language classes in Kindegarten and  two dual 
language classes in first grade.  One teacher teaches in English while the other teacher teaches in Spanish.  The children 
travel  between the two classes depending on the day. The curriculum is presented bilngually and is divided into distinct blocks 
of time; for example, day one in English, day two in Spanish, day three in English, etc.  For the other newcomers who speak 
languages such as, Mandingo, French, Twi, Fulani, and Bengali, all instruction is delivered in English, using ESL strategies to 
ensure comprehension.  If necessary, the teachers will the Language and Tranlation services to translate some documents such 
as: homework.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

 

Sheridan Academy  believes and asserts that all supports, resources, and classroom materials must be authentic and 
developmentally appropriate for age and grade level. Therefore, all language services correspond to ELLs ages and grade 
levels.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
s, On Our Way to English, a resource that covers the four spectrums of language acquisition, Reading, Listening, Speakingbased 
classroom resource designed to teach students how to work with informational texts; students learn about features of 
informational texts and are taught how to write and respond to such texts.    
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We do not have any activities in place to assist newly-enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year.     
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

 We do not have any language elective offer to ELLs this school year.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

 In our Dual Language program, we use a 50/50 model.  We have two dual language classes in 
kindegarten and  two dual language classes in first grade.  One teacher teaches in English while the other 
teacher teaches in Spanish.  The children travel  between the two classes depending on the day. The 
curriculum is presented bilngually and is divided into distinct blocks of time; for example, day one in 
English, day two in Spanish, day three in English, etc. All the academic subjects such as reading, writing, 
math, science, and social studies are taught in both English and Spanish using the 50/50 model as 
explained above.  Emergent literacy is taught in both English and Spanish.  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
  1.  ELL teachers and service providers participate of a series of professional development opportunities thoughout the school 
year in and out of the school building (i.e. small group instruction, leveling libraries, testing modifications and data analysis).   
  
4. We provide professional development for all staff. The training includes identification of ELLs, teaching strategies to support 
ELLs and tips on how best to prepare ELLs for the NYSESLAT and all NYS exams. We use the NYSESLAT Sampler and the NYS 
Rubrics as tools to drive instruction. At these workshop trainings, attendance is taken and records are maintained as evidence 
of meeting the requirement.    
The ENL and bilingual teachers will attend the ELL specific workshops offered by  OELL (Office of ELLs)  thoughout that school 
year.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
In order to assist ELLs as they transition from elementary to middle school, the ELLs are encouraged to visit the middle school 
with their parents; the teachers organize a Career Day during which the students meet professionals from various careers; and 
our school started departmentalizion of the content areas such as math and reading in grades 4-5 to give students a glimpse of 
what to expect in middle school.

Mr. Gonzalez and  the compliance teacher, Mrs. . 
  
To meet the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2,  50% of total hours for bilingual education and ENL 
teachers, the teachers will attend the various workshops offered by the Office of English Language Learners.  The agendas and 
attendance sheets for the professional development sessions will be kept by both the assistant principal supervising the ENL 
teachers, Mr Gonzalez and the compliance teacher, Mrs Chiarello.        
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
During the parent engagement period on Tuesdays, parents are invited to come to the school to discuss their children 
academic progress with the teachers. Sometimes, in lieu of a face-to-face meeting, the ELL teachers give the parents a phone 
call to inform them about their child academic performance, language development progress, and language development 
needs in ELA. The staff will use the Language and Translation Services to interpret for parents who speak other languages. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

   Parental involvement is a top priority at Sheridan Academy for Young Leaders. We believe that the success of our students, 
their family, and our community is based on a partnership to move our children forward to succeed in life. Therefore, we  seek 
opportunities to involve parents in our school life. We have the School/Parent Compact program which is a contract between 
the school, the parents and the student. The goal of this program is to involve the parents and the students in our walk toward 
achieving high academic standards. The contract involves some responsibility from the parents, the school and the students. 
The parents have  responsibilities such as , getting their children to bed early, makings classroom. The child has such duties 
like, following directions from teachers and staff, doing homework every day, askingknowledge of the curriculum and 
standards for all content areas. For our ELL parents in particular, we offer 
NYSESLAT test workshops to inform them on what they need to know  to help prepare their students for the test.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At Sheridan Academy for Young Leaders, we use different types of data and methodologies to assess the language 
preferences of the parent community for both written and oral communication. The data and methodologies 
include, but not limited to:  

A) administering the Home Language Identification Survey to parents 

B) conducting interviews with both parents and students to determine the parents' language preference. For 
instance, we encourage all parents to complete Part 3, Parent Information from the Home Language Identification 
Survey to discern the parents' preferred language. Many of our staff members are fluent in Spanish and French;

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Due to the fact that we have ESL Self Contained classes, we require ESL and bilingual certified and Speak English and 
Spanish and can do their own translation. For those families that do not Speak English or Spanish, we utilize the DOE 
Translation Unit and provide translation via the phone with a licensed translator.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Our school is a fully has ESL push-in, pull-out, and Dual Language classes where the staff speaks English and Spanish 
providing our parents with the translation needed. For those parents that do not speak English or Spanish, the staff 
knows to call the DOE Translation Unit to acquire a licensed translator.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

PS 457X will fulfill parental notification requirements for translation and interpretation services by sending the 
Parents' Guide to Language Access to the parents. The Welcome Poster will be posted throughout the school to 
ensure that parents are aware and reminded of the translation and interpretation services. Finally, the Language ID 
Guide will be displayed at the security desk and main office. Our school fulfills all requirements listed above by using 
the website of Rules and Policies to access multiple translation documents and post them at the entrance of the 
school and provide additional information with the parent coordinator. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?

At the end of the school year, the school will distribute surveys to the parents that have used the translation and 
interpretation services to garner feedback on the quality and availability of the services. Surveys are given after 
orientations and meetings with parents. Parent involvement on the Leadership Team and access through parent 
coordinator and PA are also pathways to receive feedback from parents.
