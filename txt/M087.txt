Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

 

 

P.S. 87 IS ONE FAMILY UNDER THE SUN 
 
We are a community of learners that includes children, teachers, staff and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

families. Our mission is to build a stimulating and inclusive environment in 
which every student develops academically, socially and emotionally. 
 
WE ARE COMMITTED TO: 
 
* Creating a safe and supportive school culture, which promotes academic 
risk-taking in students and teachers. 
 
* Encouraging diverse learners to become self-directed, creative 
and independent through inquiry and exploration. 
 
* Fostering critical thinking through a grade-by-grade thematic 
curriculum centered on experiential learning, always striving towards academic 
excellence. 
 
Our hope is that as students leave P.S. 87 they continue to be active 
participants in their communities 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS 87 is a PK/K-5 primary school serving families on the Upper West Side. The school itself is a draw for families 
moving into the area, not only because it offers a first-rate public education to its students, but also because the 
school retains a strong and vibrant sense of community.  

The core values of our school have always been, and will continue to be, a commitment to diversity and to 
differentiated instruction : although seemingly unrelated, we believe they go hand-in-hand. As a school, we recognize 
that in order to advance each student through their individuated instructional path, we must teach—and know—the 
whole child. Thus, by teaching tolerance and awareness, we show our children that when we acknowledge difference, 
we can both promote inclusion and improve education. 

 

We are committed to: 

● Creating a safe and supportive school culture, which promotes academic risk-taking by students and teachers. 

● Encouraging diverse learners to become self-directed, creative, and independent through inquiry and exploration. 

● Fostering critical thinking through a grade-by-grade thematic curriculum centered on experiential learning, always 
striving towards academic excellence. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

18% of our students have IEPs. The needs of these students are varied, but we do have a number of students with 
reading learning disabilities, speech and language impairments, and students on the Autism spectrum. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

The 2017-2018 School Quality Guide shows that we have made improvements or remained the same in all areas of 
the Framework for great schools except in the area of trust. Our significant improvement over years suggest that our 
school’s investment and methodologies are working. By most measures, we are an extremely successful school. 
 
One of our goals is to have an increase in this year by building stronger connections within our community through 
the work we will be doing under the area of supportive environment.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
During the 2016-2017 Quality Review, it was noticed that there is an inconsistent level of rigor in the math discussions 
across classrooms. It was also noticed that overall, the discourse in our literacy based classes were more rigorous than 
the discourse in the math classrooms. The students interviewed during the review process also stated that they did 
not find math as engaging or challenging as reading, writing, or social studies, which we believe may be linked to the 
level of rigor in the discussion in the math classrooms. While this was a focus last year during classroom observations, 
we still noticed that there was a gap between the discourse in the math classes and English language arts classes. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, through an ongoing data analysis process of examining summative tasks, there will be an increase of 10% 
of students meeting grade level benchmarks in math from the BOY assessment.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32 

 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S.087 William Sherman , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A 
of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

P.S.087 William Sherman will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events;

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

P.S.087 William Sherman , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act 
(ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by 
Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
A variety of formative and curriculum-embedded assessments are employed to guide instruction for our ELLs/MLLs.  Across all 
grades, from kindergarten to 5th grade, the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System is used to assess students’ 
independent and instructional reading levels. Teachers also construct assessments based on their specific curricula to assess 
our students. For example, the ENL teacher and classroom teachers construct rubrics that are based on theories that have 
been promulgated by proponents of the Universal Design for Learning. The type of rubric implemented will vary depending on 
the topic being taught. For example, one rubric might assess the ability of students to write descriptively and another might 
assess their ability to implement explanatory writing.  Once these rubrics have been constructed, ELLs/MLLs are tasked with 
self-assessment. Once the students have established how they believe they have fared on task completion, they then are 
required to write a brief justification as to how they arrived at their conclusion.  Then ENL teacher will read their assessment 
and the accompanying paragraph and will then assess the accuracy of the students’ response.  A follow-up conversation 
between the student and the teacher, in which the similarities and discrepancies between the teacher’s response and the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

student’s response are discussed, will then ensue. The data acquired from the variety of assessments used at PS 87 informs 
our planning by allowing us to engage in best practices. Finally, another manner in which we formatively assess students is 
through the use of student portfolios.  Maintained for as long as a student retains ELL/MLL status or Ex-ELL status, portfolios 
present the aggregate of student endeavor and thus allow a long-term view of student progress.  
 
The data acquired by the formative assessments provides insights into ELL progress in their acquisition of speaking, listening, 
reading and writing skills. Furthermore the data acquired from formative assessments informs our school's instructional 
planning by indicating how we can best provide differentiated instruction for each child. For example, if after administering 
Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessments, the data retrieved indicates that students need additional support in their 
decoding skills, they might receive targeted decoding instruction by a teacher trained in the Orton Gillingham method.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

PS 87 maintains many structures in order to support this effort. Foremost is conferencing among teachers and students so that 
teachers can ensure that students have an accurate perception of how effectively they have performed and so that they can 
then use this newly obtained information to improve their skills.  Classroom teachers and teachers operating outside of the 
regular class structure, such as service-providers, also conference and discuss student performance.  Moreover, during grade 
meetings, teachers, working collaboratively, appraise and share rubrics and other self-created assessments. 
 
One of the foundational structures in place to support instructional planning is teacher participation in weekly grade 
meetings.  During weekly grade meetings, teachers evaluate assessment results, and adjust curriculum across content areas to 
meet the student needs that have been reflected in the assessments. On Monday afternoons, teachers participate in weekly 
school-wide meetings during which they also have the opportunity to disseminate student results and to re-align curricula.     
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
  Summative assessments such as NYSESLAT scores, in conjunction with the ELL Data Analysis Tool, are used to identify 
baseline progress and areas of need. PS 87 closely examines how each individual student performed in the Speaking, Listening, 
Reading and Writing modalities and whether or not the data indicates a trend in overall student performance.  Beyond 
examining whether scores improved, remained stable or declined, identifying precisely in which areas students were excelling 
and in which areas they were need of additional support, the ENL teacher also assesses how closely students were to reaching 
the next performance level. Furthermore, if a student’s performance declined, the ENL teacher examines possible causes. 
Some of the factors under consideration are the following. Did the student have difficulty in one particular modality? If so, 
what does that difficulty comprise of? If the student is an ELL-SWD, how did this status affect the student’s ability to 
successfully negotiate the test? Another factor that must be considered, especially in the lower grades, is the unpredictability 
of administering formalized assessments to young children: perhaps a student underperformed simply because they were 
experiencing a challenging day or were otherwise distracted by events outside the testing setting? Finally, another baseline 
assessment we administer is the Spanish-Lab, which is administered after the student has been identified as an ELL/MLL.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

PS 87 maintains many structures to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered. Using the RtI 
approach, teachers at PS 87 assess whether the summative data indicates whether a student, receiving quality in-class Tier 1 
interventions, is in need of additional support.  If the data indicates further support is necessary, then students receive Tier 2 
interventions. Strategies for Tier 2 interventions include paired-reading, repeating reading passages and small-group 
instruction.  If students require additional support, then, with parental involvement and assent, they receive Tier 3 
interventions. PS 87 implements a variety of Tier 3 interventions.  At PS 87, we have: a S.E.T.T.s teacher who employs a multi-
sensory approach across cross-content curricula, Boost Up, which is reading intervention in which the teacher uses a Fountas 
and Pinnel based program, a Math Intervention program and an I.E.P teacher who provides decoding and reading support to 
students in the younger grades by using S.P.I.R.E, an Orton Gillingham based program.  As of the 2017-2018 academic year, the 
S.E.T.T.s teacher and the Boost Up teacher will also receive training in the S.P.I.R.E.  program. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 Our school uses data to guide instruction for ELLs/MLLs within the Response to Intervention framework by taking into 
consideration a variety of factors.  Using the ELL Data Analysis Tool, we determine how many NYSESLAT exams each student 
has taken, in which modalities each individual student demonstrated areas of strength and in which they demonstrated areas 
of need and which students are at risk level 3 or greater.  Moreover, we also examine how students performed on other state-
wide assessments such as the ELA, State Math test, the ELE and the Science exam.  After all the data has been consolidated, 
we are able to apply the appropriate level of RtI intervention.  While all students receive quality Tier 1 interventions, the data 
accumulated from the above methods enables us to determine which Tier 2 and Tier 3 interventions would be most 
appropriate for each student.. Using a multi-sensory approach and applying the principles set forth in the Universal Design for 
Learning, in small group to individual settings, we provide a variety of means by which ELLs/MLLs requiring Tier 2 and Tier 3 
interventions can engage with the curricula. The progress of these students is closely monitored and instruction is 
individualized, with students requiring Tier 2 interventions engaging in embedded learning activities and students requiring 
Tier 3 interventions receiving a higher degree of scaffolding. 
 
Another manner in which our school implements the RtI framework is by having Pupil Personnel Team (P.P.T.) meetings for 
students who might require more than Tier 1 interventions. A P.P.T. meeting is initiated after a concern is expressed, either by 
a classroom teacher, ENL teacher or parent, about a student's progress. At the P.P.T. meeting, the team reviews a checklist of 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 strategies and discusses the efficacy of the interventions for the child. If, after group consensus, Tier 3 
interventions are deemed necessary, additional supports will be given.  There are a variety of additional supports offered at 
our school. For example, the student might be given the opportunity to: join Boost Up, our literacy intervention program for 
students in the younger grades, visit our math specialist, or receive "At Risk" services from our special education teachers.  PS 
87 also uses assessment data to inform decisions about Tier 3 interventions. For example, data acquired from assessment data 
is factored in when deciding whether a student would benefit from receiving an Individualized Education Plan or whether a 
student would be better served in an I.C.T. setting.   
 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The outcome assessments used to determine whether progress has been made in our ELL programs include the NYSESLAT, 
ELA, Math, ELE and 4th Grade Science and Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System. These assessments provide the 
data necessary to determine whether students have made yearly progress.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

PS 87 has a variety of structures in place to disseminate these findings so that we may initiate adjustments to our ELLs/MLLs 
programs. Assessment results are distributed to teachers, administrators and to students’ families. Teachers also discuss the 
findings in casual meetings and in the more formal setting of P.P.T. Assessment results are also discussed with ELL/MLL 
families during the allocated weekly Parent Engagement time on Tuesday afternoons, the biannual Parent-Teacher 
conferences and during I.E.P. meetings.  Families are provided the opportunity to share knowledge and insight they possess 
that might assist in creating an optimal learning environment for their child.  
 
Furthermore, another way in which PS 87 disseminates NYSESLAT outcomes is through use of the teachers' school mailboxes. 
Classroom teachers are sent NYSESLAT scores. Included with the scores is a break down of how the student scored within each 
modality subset. Based on student outcome as indicated by performance level and on how each student performed within 
each modality, the ENL teacher makes adjustments to the ENL program.  Adjustments are made whenever data from periodic 
assessments is received. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 Instruction for ELLs/MLLs is delivered in the Freestanding ENL program by using students’ Proficiency Levels and 
grade to create instructional groups. Students’ needs are determined by using their NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores 
and by analyzing the results generated on the ELL Data Analysis Tool. Once instructional groups have been 
determined, instruction is differentiated so that the various needs of the students are met and so that instruction is 
aligned with the Targets of Measurement for each Proficiency Level and with the Next Generation Learning Standards. 
The ENL teacher also works closely with the classroom teachers to integrate the curriculum and to discuss student 
progress, development and ELL student interaction with EP students. 
 
The integrated and stand-alone ENL programs are implemented by coordinated effort between the classroom 
teachers and the ENL teacher. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not applicable 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

 The Dual Language Program is in English and Spanish.   Part of the day is in English and the other part is in 
Spanish.   50/50 model is followed.  Content is taught in both languages.   Spanish books and as well as the Envisions 
Math Program are in Spanish.    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           The staff is organized to meet the mandated minutes of ESL instruction by having a full-time certified ESL teacher.  In 
addition, the certified five Dual Immersion teachers are also full time. As per  CR Part 154, the children in the beginning and 
intermediate levels of English proficiency  receive 360 minutes of ESL per week.  Children at the advanced level receive180 
minutes of ESL per week.  They receive the mandated minutes of ELA in the regular classroom setting.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  In the Free-standing ENL program, the Integrated ENL program and in the Bilingual program, the core content is delivered 
using a variety of approaches and methods.  In both ENL programs, since our students have heterogeneous backgrounds—for 
example, we have students whose home languages are Estonian, Japanese  and Serbo-Croatian, the instructional language 
used is predominately English. However, whenever possible, through the use of technology, translating services, other 
students and the ENL teacher, home language support is also provided. For example, our school currently has five French 
dominant students in the ENL program and since our ENL teacher speaks French, she is able to foster language development 
and provide content to these students in  French.  Additionally, PS 87 has six students whose home language is Mandarin and 
whenever possible or appropriate, these students provide academic support for each other in their home language and using 
each other as references. For students whose home language is unfamiliar to the teachers or to other students, which is the 
case for our Albanian, Estonian and German speaking students, translation services available on the computer are used to aid 
student comprehension and foster language development. In providing core content to our ELLs/MLLs, the ENL and Dual 
Immersion teachers first access the data from outcome assessments to ensure that instruction is differentiated. Then, in 
alignment with the Next Generation Learning Standards, instruction, provided using a multi-sensory approach and oriented 
towards improving students’ critical thinking skills and academic vocabulary, is custom-designed to be cognitively challenging 
and to meet the needs of each student. The students' prior knowledge and experiences are also accessed so that material may 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

be contextualized. In every unit, students are engaged in improving their skills in all modalities.  Using the model of Judith 
Hochman found in her seminal text Teaching Basic Writing Skills, students are taught how to dissect complex sentences and 
are then taught how to formulate their own. Students embark on reading a variety of texts, from fiction to non-fiction, and use 
on-line resources such as newsela.com for content material. Content is also delivered using a variety of graphic-organizers, and 
learning objectives are achieved used on a model based on Bloom’s taxonomy. Throughout the academic year, students 
enhance their speaking skills by generating and asking information based and inferential questions. They learn how to provide 
evidence to support their arguments.  They improve their use of socio-pragmatic functions and develop their academic 
vocabulary with strategies developed by Professor Kate Kinsella. Students engage in purposeful and deliberate conversations 
that amplify their their understanding and use of academic vocabulary across all content areas. Furthermore, they improve 
their listening skills by listening to recording text and video clips. Students also read texts based on their individual 
performance level so that the text of a student at the Emerging level will differ from that of a student at the Transitioning 
level. Throughout the course of unit study, students receive self-assessment rubrics which contain established and previously 
discussed criteria.  After the students have completed their self-assessment, they are required to write a brief paragraph 
explaining how they arrived at their conclusions. After the students have completed the self-assessment rubrics, the ENL 
teacher completes the same rubric and conferences with each student.  
 
The Hochman Method is implemented in the upper grades, grades 3-5. However, components of the Method have been 
adapted and are also used in the lower grades. One example of this can be found in the way PS 87 has adapted Hochman's use 
of sentence extenders. Students in grades 1-2 are encouraged to continue their sentences and provide more detailed 
responses by adding coordinating conjunctions such as 'and, so, but' to their sentences. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Students are provided access to information in their home language through internet resources and library resources such as 
books and software. In addition, students are connected with peers who also speak their home language. Spanish speaking 
ELLs within the Dual Language setting will be evaluated through the ELE.  PS 87 currently has students whose home languages 
are among others, Dutch, Croatian and Estonian. In order to evaluate these students in their home language, we rely on 
student self-assessment and parent/family feedback.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
a. SIFE 
5a. Currently, our school does not have any SIFE students. However, if we did have SIFE students, we would first obtain a 
verbal record of the student’s educational history and, if possible, obtain their work from their previous schools.  Next we 
would administer the New York State Oral Interview Questionnaire. Next we would administer the New York State Multilingual 
Literacy SIFE Screener.  After that we would procure a Writing Screener.  Finally, we would also reach out to the student’s 
parent or guardian and discuss ways in which the parent or guardian could provide additional support in the home 
environment. These procedures would enable us to understand how we should differentiate instruction for this student and 
although a student’s status as a SIFE is removed once that student reaches the Transitioning level as determined on the 
NYSESLAT, we would continue to monitor the student’s assessment and modify instruction accordingly. 
b.Newcomer 
5b. Currently, 90% of our enrolled students are classified as Newcomers with less than three years of service.  Of these 
students, nine are new to our school this year.  We have three students at the Entering level, two students at the Emerging 
Level, eight students at the Transitioning Level and eighteen students at Expanding level.  We welcomed students whose home 
languages are Norwegian, Greek, Hebrew, Mandarin and Spanish., Our primary focus for students who are at the Entering 
level is to enable them understand and engage in classroom content so that they are able to express their thoughts, in both 
spoken and written form, in the classroom.  Attention is also paid to the transferability of the students’ literacy and writing 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

skills from their home language into English and to the development of their meta-cognitive skills. At all the levels of English 
language learning, Entering through Expanding, classroom instruction is differentiated and time is allocated to developing their 
academic vocabulary across content areas and improving their ability to respond to increasingly complex level of diverse 
texts.  Instructional time is also allocated for developing students understanding and use of visual information that often 
accompanies texts, such as diagrams, maps or charts. In implementing this instruction, the ENL teacher develops instructional 
plans that access students’ previous knowledge or experiences and uses this knowledge or experiences as a platform from 
which to build an understanding of the new content.  
c. Developing 
5c.Currently four of our students have been identified as Developing ELLs/MLLs. These students have also been identified as 
ELLS-SWDs. All of these students are receiving Tier 3 interventions, such as SETTs services and speech therapy, which are 
based on the RtI framework.  As mentioned previously, using the ELL Data Analysis Tool, outcomes on summative assessments, 
as well as those on evaluative assessments, have been assessed. Furthermore, the Performance Level Descriptors (PLDs) and 
Anchors for the Targets of Measurements (ToMs) for each of these students have also been examined in order to create 
curricula that would, using differentiated instruction and a multi-sensory approach, strengthen the skills of each student in 
speaking, listening, reading and writing.  We continue to monitor the progress of these students and to adjust our instruction 
when necessary. 
d. Long term 
5d. Currently, our school does currently not have any long-term students.   However, if we did, our procedures would be 
similar to those we would use for the Developing ELLs: we would use the Performance Level Descriptors (PLDs) and look at the 
Anchors for the Targets of Measurements (ToMs) to create curricula that would, using differentiated instruction, strengthen 
the skills of each student in speaking, listening, reading and writing. Furthermore, we would also continue to monitor their 
progress. 
e. Former ELLs 
We currently have nine students who have been identified as former ELLs/MLLs. The classroom teachers, in conjunction with 
the ENL teacher, provide necessary support for ELLs/MLLs who are at the Commanding level. Furthermore, we continue to 
monitor their progress and to ensure that they understand Tier 2 and Tier 3 vocabulary 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
To begin with, PS 87 provides Integrated Co-Teaching classes in all grades, kindergarten through fifth. Teachers at PS 87 also 
use a variety of instructional strategies and grade-level materials for ELLS-SWDS that provide both access to academic content 
and accelerate English language development. When providing ELLS-SWDS with instruction, teachers, both in the classroom 
and in the support setting, teachers employ Response to Intervention (RTI) approaches that begin with Tier 1 strategies, which 
include high-quality differentiated instruction.  Students who are ELLS-SWDS receive, Tier 2 and Tier 3 strategies. For example, 
data reveals that ELLs/MLLs who are struggling to decode benefit from exposure to phonics-based programs such as Orton-
Gillingham and Fundations. Another programs that has been adopted for students in the lower grades is the Lively Letters 
program.  Furthermore, PS 87 has a S.E.T.T.s teacher who employs a multi-sensory approach across cross-content curricula. 
Our Boost Up reading intervention program is run by a teacher who uses a Fountas and Pinnel based program. We provide a 
Math Intervention program and also have an I.E.P teacher who provides decoding and reading support to students in the 
younger grades by using S.P.I.R.E, an Orton Gillingham based program.  Additionally, we also have a Mandarin/Cantonese 
speaking intervention specialist. As of the 2017-2018 academic year, the S.E.T.T.s teacher and the Boost Up teacher will also 
receive training in the S.P.I.R.E. program. Finally, students are provided necessary accommodations when taking state and local 
assessments. These accommodations include, but are not limited to: having students take NYS assessments in small groups in 
separate locations, providing the student with a third reading of the listening selection on the English Language Arts exam or 
providing the student with on-task prompting.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
PS 87 uses curricular, instruction and scheduling flexibility to ensure that ELLs/MLLs-SWDs achieve their IEP goals and attain 
English Language Proficiency within the least restrictive environment and in alignment with the Next Generation Learning 
Standards. Implementing the RtI framework, PS 87 employs Tier 2 and Tier 3 strategies. For example, PS 87 provides ICT classes 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

for ELLs/MLLs-SWDs who benefit from differentiated, multi-sensory, small-group instruction within a general education 
setting. In addition, our ELL/MLL-SWD in second grade also receives support from a Cantonese-speaking intervention 
specialist. Furthermore, using all available data, the ENL and classroom teachers develop an understanding of the students' 
learning profile.  Teachers also meet with the families of ELLs/MLLs-SWDs to increase their understanding of the students’ 
home background and culture. Instruction is differentiated to meet the needs of the student as these needs are described on 
the student's IEP.  Currently, seven students receive intervention in our Integrative Collaborative Teaching (I.C.T. program). 
These students also receive different services such speech therapy or occupational therapy and counseling services are 
available through our guidance counselor.  In the D.I. program, we have one child with an I.E.P. who is receiving S.E.T.T.s. All of 
these services are provided by licensed teachers and therapists. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
8. PS 87 offers targeted intervention programs for ELLs in all content areas.  Currently, our Newcomer ELLs/MLLs require 
minimal intervention services as one Newcomer ELL/MLL in the Dual Immersion program student is receiving reading 
intervention services. Developing ELLs/MLLs are all ELLs/MLLs-SWDs and they receive a Tier 3 interventions in the ICT setting 
as well as Boost Up, SETTs an speech services.  
 
Our school provides Boost Up, an early reading intervention program, math support, SETTs, counseling and at risk services. 
Intervention services are offered in Spanish and English and are available for all ELL subgroups.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In October, teachers, paraprofessionals and other members of the PS 87 staff received professional development  in the use of 
Google Drive, and in particular, Google classroom in order to facilitate the sharing of teacher-created assessments and 
documents and to digitalize assignment differentiation. Many teachers have also created their own classroom web pages. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

PS 87 retains its bilingual program.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs/MLLs at PS 87 are afforded equal access to our rich and integrated curricula. In addition to art, drama, music, science and 
physical education classes, ELLs/MLLs are provided the opportunity to engage in a variety of specialized classes such as chess, 
reading buddies, Ballet Hispanico and Indian dance. Furthermore, throughout every grade level and culminating in a four day 
trip to Nature’s Classroom in fifth grade, ELLs/MLLs embark on field trips which take advantage of our city’s rich cultural 
heritage.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
PS 87 employs a vast array of instructional materials to support our ELLs/MLLs. These instructional materials include, but are 
not limited to: the use of ELMOs in classrooms, mentor texts and guided reading books, realia and manipulatives,  access to 
the ENL teacher’s library, which includes books on every level of the Fountas and Pinnell scale, the use of home language 
support via electronic translations, chapter books, big books, visuals, graphic organizers, charts, maps, video clips, books on 
CD,  sentence starters, whiteboards, alphabet charts and word wall charts.  Additionally, if possible, students are also provided 
the opportunity to receive the State Math test in their home language. The use of ELMOs is also prominent in many classrooms 
across many grade spans. Lastly, two fourth grade classes are pioneering the use of Promethean Boards in their classrooms. 
They are using these boards to promote student engagement across a wide spectrum of classroom actitivities.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In the ENL program, in both the Freestanding and Integrated programs, native language support is delivered in a variety of 
ways.  To begin with, we use adaptive technology so that our students can access content in their home language. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

Furthermore, if a fellow student or a member of the PS 87 speaks the same language as one of students who is desiring home 
language support, we employ that person to assist that student. For example, we have a Mandarin/Cantonese speaking 
intervention specialist who assists some of our students. Our French student can receive home language support by 
communicating in their home language with our ENL teacher. We also have a large number of Spanish-speaking teachers and 
staff who are available to provide support in the home language. Furthermore, when possible, students are provided books to 
read in their native language.  Additionally, at the Parent Orientation Meeting, the ENL teacher explains to parents the 
accessblilty of books in their native language by showing them how to access the New York Public Library website to request 
books.  Lastly, when applicable, students are provided math and science tests in their native language.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Our school ensures that all required services support and correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels by several means.  First of 
all, we analyze the accumulated data in order to undertand precisely what are students’ needs are.  Secondly, all of our 
ELLs/MLLs receive services/resource support through Freestanding ENL classes, Integrated ENL classes or through our Spanish 
Dual Immersion Program.  Thirdly, in every grade, our school has  I.C.T. classes for ELLs/MLLs-SWD, which are taught by 
certified Special Education teacher.  Furthermore, PS 87 has also a Mandarin/Cantonese intervention specialist, literacy 
coaches, a math coach, SETTs teachers, speech therapists, occupational therapist, physical therapists and a guidance counselor 
to ensure that all our ELLs/MLLs needs are met.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school does not share a building.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
PS 87 engages in many activities to assist newly enrolled ELLs/MLLs prior to the beginning of the school year. For example 
spring prior to the beginning of the next school year, our school invites incoming kindergarten students, including potential 
ELLs/MLLs, to attend a “Taste of Kindergarten.”  Every kindergarten teacher in our school is involved in the planning and 
presentation of this experience. Furthermore, newly enrolled ELLs/MLLs are introduced to ELLs/MLLs or other students who 
speak their language so that the transition for new ELLs is facilitated. The ENL teacher also introduces ELLs families to other ELL 
families that share their language/home culture so that these families may establish connections outside of school.  Lastly, 
whenever possible, newly enrolled ELLs/MLLs are given the opportunity to tour our school and to meet their future teachers.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Our school offers a comprehensive Spanish Dual Immersion Program for students in every grade. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

The Dual Language Model that we use is the self contained 50/50 model in grades K-5.  The students stay 
together through the 5  th   grade.  We speak English/Spanish in all content areas.   We rotate in the 
amount that we use the language allocation.     
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Every year all ELL/MLL staff at PS 87 engage in professional development. For example, our ENL teacher attends professional 
development provided by the Manhattan Field Support ELL Service Coordinator.  Our staff also attends in-school development 
such as reading support.  
 
Our ENL teacher is participating in six professional development workshops offered by the Manhattan Field Support Center 
that are aimed at promoting advanced literacy strategies by exploring instructional approaches that enable ELLs/MLLs to meet 
the high level demands of academic performance tasks.  The dates for these workshops are:  09-19-17, 10-18-17, 11-28-17, 01-
25-18, 03-09-18. She will also be attending a PD titled 'Intro to Executive Function--Literacy Perspective K-5. Information from 
all of these PD will be shared with all teachers of ELLs.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
We plan to have ELL training on the designated Chancellor days. Topics for ELL training will be: the ESL Process: How Students 
Are Designated ELLs, How They Enter and Leave the Program and the Program Choices Available to Them, Teaching Content 
and Vocabulary to the Newcomer ELLs, Cultural and Linguistic Differences and School Environment, Additionally, we provide 
monthly meetings during which teachers are afforded the opportunity to acquire best practice strategies from their fellow 
colleagues. Sign-ins are kept to keep track of teacher attendance.  
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our ENL provides parents with numerous opportunities to meet, or discuss over the phone, during the school year.  She 
encourages parents to reach out to her and provides all parents with her DOE email address (or alternatively recommends that 
they send her a note via backpack) so that a meeting time can be made.  As Tuesday afternoons have been allocated as parent 
meeting time, our ENL teacher often meets with parents then. Our ENL teacher also communicates via email, and when 
necessary, includes a translated version of her message, with parents.  
 
Furthermore, in conjunction with our Parent Association President, Debby Saito, our ENL teacher is creating an International 
Network. The purpose of this network is threefold: to foster connections between PS 87 families and enable them to share 
their cultural and linguistic heritages,  to create language-based playgroups and finally to connect newly-arrived families with 
established families in order to facilitate a smooth transition to our school and city. Within the next few weeks, an 
announcement inviting families to attend an informational meeting about the International Network will be sent out in the PS 
87 Backpack News.  The meeting, organized by our PA president and our ENL teacher, will be on November 20th at 8:00am and 
will be held in the school's library.  Translators will also be available at the meeting. 
 
In addition, Tuesday afternoons have been allocated as parent engagement time, our ENL teacher encourages parents to 
attend meetings in order to discuss their children's language proficiency results, learning strategies and academic 
goals.  Parents have been given the ENL teacher's DOE email address and they most frequently prefer to arrange meetings via 
email. However, if email is not the most effective means of communication, then the ENL teacher will send messages home in 
the students' backpacks or she will call the families. If a parent/guardian is not able to personally attend a meeting, then the 
ENL teacher provides an opportunity to have a phone conference instead.  Furthermore, the ENL teacher speaks French, Italian 
and some Japanese, so she can conduct parent meetings using these languages. PS 87 also has plenty of Spanish speakers who 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

 

volunteer to translate. Other members of the PS 87 community speak Portugese, Japanese, Korean and Lithuanian. Translation 
services are also used for a variety of other languages.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

PS 87 provides annual individual meetings, which are not part of the biannual parent-teacher conferences, with parents of 
ELLs/MLLs through out the school year.  Every Tuesday afternoon, from 2:40-4:00, parents are encouraged and requested to 
attend Parent Engagement Meetings in order to discuss their children’s language proficiency results, learning strategies and 
academic goals. If the parent is not able to attend in person, the ENL teacher also conducts conversations over the 
phone.  Furthermore, she encourages parents to reach out to her and provides all parents with her DOE email address (or 
alternatively recommends that they send her a note via backpack) so that a meeting time can be made. Translation services 
available for parents are delivered in three different ways. The first method is through the use of school staff: if a member of 
the school staff speaks the language of the parent, then that staff member will assist the parent.  For example, many members 
of our staff speak Spanish; however, on staff at PS 87 are also people who speak Italian, French, Portugese, Korean and 
Lithuanian who can assist parents speaking those languages.  If parents speak a language unfamiliar to a staff member, we will 
search for other parents in our school community who speak that language and who might be of assistance.  If is not possible 
to find families sharing the same linguistic background, we will use electronic support, such as the Google translation services, 
to assist the parents. In the 2017-2018 school year, we will generate the Adult Preferred Language Report in ATS to identify by 
which language our ELL/MLL parents prefer to communicate.  Based upon parent reply, we provide a translator. ELL/MLL 
parent involvement is fostered in the classroom and at the community level.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Monica Berry, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

When parents register, the ESL teacher or the prinicipal walks all parents through th HLIS survery. Most of our 
parents state that they want communication from the school to come in English. We then speak with the parents 
more to make sure this is truly their preference and let them know that we can provide translated materials to 
them if needed.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55

We have one family that 
prefers to receive written 
and oral communication in 
Chinese and 4 families that 
prefer to receive written 
and oral communication in 
Spanish.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.

We have our school calendar and other 
important school information posted 
on our school website www.ps87.info. 
There is an option to translate the site 
into any of the 34 languages spoken 
here at PS 87. All information that is 
sent home in backpacks, we place on 
this site to information can be 
translated for parents. We also give 
translated copies to parents who have 
requested written communication in 
Chinese and Spanish.  

   

 

2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as 

parent-teacher  
conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56

We participat in the four parent 
teacher conferences listed on the 
school calendar for the 2015-2016 
school year. In September we had 
our first Parent Curriculum meeting. 
In November and March we will have 
one on one parent meetings and in 
June we will have a night for parent 
workshops. The guidance counselor 
sets up one on one meetings with 
parents to discuss middle school and 
any other emotional issues that may 
come in the school for the child. If 
there is an issue with attendance, the 
attendance teacher will visit the 
home of those students.  

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

All of the above information is printed by the Department of Education in multiple languages We give copies of these 
documents to parents who are in need of the information in a different language. Again, most parents are asking to 
have the information in English.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Because of the low number of familes in need of tranlation services, the classroom teachers reach out to the families 
directly to see if they are satisfied with the translation services they receive. This information is reported back to the 
adminitration.
