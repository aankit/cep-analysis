Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

P.S. 16 is a school community dedicated to a belief that all students can meet standards of excellence -- all students 
can reach their dreams. Our mission is to provide standards-driven instruction through meaningful learning 
experiences, so that our students acquire literacy skills and become critical thinkers. We acknowledge the importance 
of community involvement and values in today's society. Our programs strengthen the home/school partnership 
connection so that our students develop the social skills necessary to succeed in the world community. It is our belief 
that the teamwork and collaborative efforts on the part of all members, and the school community, and our focus on 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

literacy, technology and the arts, will help create a community of life-long learners and prepare our students for the 
demands of the twenty-first century.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The Nancy DeBennedittis School, P.S. 16 Q, is located in the Corona section of Queens, a densely populated area with 
a large immigrant population. Approximately 44% of P.S. 16’s students are classified as ELLs (English Language 
Learners). As a result, our School offers a menu of options to its large community of ELLs. Parents of ELLs can choose 
from numerous models of instruction: Transitional Bilingual Education, Dual Language (English and Spanish), English 
as a New Language (ENL) integrated classes or ENL push-in instruction. Instruction for ELLs is differentiated based 
upon student performance, the New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) Item 
Analysis, The ENL Standards and the Stages of Language Acquisition. 

At P.S. 16 we believe in building a strong partnership with parents. We regularly welcome parents to celebrations, 
provide parent workshops, host special community building events, and maintain parent contact through weekly 
Parent Engagement opportunities and quarterly meetings between parents, teachers and students. 

Public School 16Q is a school where students want to be. With a a year-to-date attendance rate (as of June 07, 2018) 
of 95.5%, our School continues to exceed both Citywide and peer-school averages.  

“Where we reach for our dreams…” is our motto. All constituencies are involved in lifting and pushing each other 
towards individual and collective dreams. Collectively, our Vision is to foster a community of life-long learners 
dedicated to the success and acceleration of learning for all children. In this vain, our staff continues their own 
professional growth and development. We build upon past successes and target areas in need of improvement. This is 
accomplished by: 

 

Internalizing the culture of our School, which includes: creating Standards-based classrooms and challenging 
our students through the use of higher-order thinking questions and discussions 

  Providing in-house mentoring for new teachers 
  Affording our teachers multiple opportunities to attend workshops both inside and outside of our School and 
  Maintaining two curriculum coaches 

In the 2017-2018 school year, we continued our focus on improving student progress, especially for our ELLS through: 

a school-wide Instructional focus centered on student autonomy  

 
  Partnering with The Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) and 
 

a focus on Collaborative Teacher Team Models 

During the 2018-2019 school year, we will continue to support improving student progress through maintaining our 
school-wide instructional focus, continuing our partnership with TCRWP, maintaining three RtI teachers, and 
maintaining two curriculum coaches 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

At P.S. 16, our special student populations include ELLs (43.89%) and SWDs (19.05%). Both special populations 
perform below their general education counterparts which results in substantial performance gaps; as evidenced by 
ELA and Math Testing Data as well as in-house assessments. Specific data regarding the gaps for both subgroups are 
included in the Needs Assessment for Goal 5A. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

In the 2017-2018 school year, our school made the most progress in the following elements: 

  Collaborative Teachers and 
  Effective School Leadership 

This progress is evident through our end-of-year 2017-18 CEP goal analysis. For our Collaborative Teacher goal, we 
exceeded our goal of an 84% positive response rate on the sub-category "Peer Collaboration" on the 2017-18 School 
Quality Guide by 2%. In addition, our goal of increasing the positive response rate on the sub-category "Program 
Coherence" on The 2017-18 School Quality Guide to 80% was exceeded by 5%. 

Our key area of focus for the 2017-18 school year is Rigorous Instruction--specifically, increasing reading performance 
for our ELLs and SWDs.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths: 

  According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, we received a score of 4.23 for the Framework Element 

'Rigorous Instruction' which is 0.37% higher than the district-wide average, and 0.54% higher than the city-
wide average. 

  Our Quality Review (3/18/16) rated Curriculum as "Well Developed", noting, "There is a coherent curriculum 

across grades that promotes cognitive engagement and acquisition of college and career readiness skills for all 
students." 

 

Priority Needs: 

  According to our 2016-17 School Report Card, we did not make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) in English 

Language Arts (ELA) for our ELL and SWD subgroups 

After reviewing our May/June 2018 TCRWP assessment data, the following was discovered: 

  24% of our ELLs are reading on or above grade level (17.4% lower than our June 2018 CEP goal) 
  59% of our Non-ELLS are reading on or above grade level (35% Performance Gap) 
  18% of our SWDs are reading on or above grade level (14% less than our June 2018 CEP goal)  
  49% of our GE students are reading on or above grade level (31% Performance Gap) 

After reviewing our Spring 2018 NYS ELA data, the following was discovered: 

  12% of our ELLS scored a Level 3or 4 (proficient) 
  45% of our Non-ELLs scored a Level 3 or 4 (33% Performance Gap) 
  11% of our SWDs scored a Level 3or 4 (proficient) 
  36% of our GE students scored a Level 3 or 4 (25% Performance Gap) 

As a result of our data analysis, as well as not making Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP), it is evident that we need to 
focus on supporting our ELLs and SWDs in reading performance. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June of 2019, it is our goal to have a 3% increase in "on or above grade level" reading performance (Benchmarks 3 
&4) for our ELLs (28.07%) and SWDs (20.97%), as measured by the TCWRP Reading Assessment.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Strengths: 

According to Our Quality Review (3/18/16): 

 

School Culture/High Expectations was rated as "Well Developed". 

According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide:  

  We received a score of 3.75 for the sub-category "Social-Emotional" under the Framework Element 

"Supportive Environment", which is 5% higher than the district-wide average, and 4% higher than the citywide 
average. 

  We received a 90% positive response rate on the sub-category "Social-Emotional" under the Framework 

Element "Supportive Environment" 

Priority Needs: 

According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide:  

  We received a Survey Element Score of 3.60 for the Framework Element "Supportive Environment", which is 

 

.14 lower than our 2017 score of 3.74 
In the Framework Element "Supportive Environment", under the subcategory "Personal Attention & Support", 
we received a score of 3.20, which is 5% lower than the district-wide average and 2% lower than the city-wide 
average. 

  We received an 84% positive response rate for the statement "teachers say that adults at their school have 
access to school based supports to assist in behavioral and emotional escalations "within the sub-category 
"Social-Emotional" under the Framework Element "Supportive Environment" 

  We received an 64% positive response rate for the statement "students rarely or never harass, bully or 

intimidate other students" 

Therefore, we determined that a focus on access to school based behavioral/emotional supports and bullying were 
areas of focus. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19 

 

identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, it is our goal to improve school based supports for behavioral escalations, emotional escalations and 
anti-bullying, as evidenced by a 3% increase in the positive response rates for the statements "teachers say that adults 
at their school have access to school based supports to assist in behavioral and emotional escalations" (87%) and 
"students rarely or never harass, bully or intimidate other students" (67%), as measured by the 2018-19 School 
Quality Guide.

Leadership Team, the Measures of Student Learning (MoSL) Team and the School Leadership Team.. The following are 
examples of collaborative assessment decisions: 

When making Periodic Assessment Selections, all teachers in grades 3-5 participated in a survey that focused on 
rating the value of each assessment and the frequency with which each assessment should be administered. Periodic 
Assessment selections were made based upon the survey results. 

Teacher Team Meetings have, and will continue to, address the use of performance tasks, benchmark assessments 
and curriculum-based assessments to assess progress towards meeting the Common Core Learning Standards. 

School based surveys have guided decision making regarding Internet Based tools and interventions purchased for the 
school (myON, Lexia Core 5, i-Ready Reading and Math, BrainPop, BrainPop Jr., BrainPop ESL, MyON, First in Math) 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 16 The Nancy DeBenedittis School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

P.S. 16Q, The Nancy DeBenedittis School, will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,

policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on 
the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase 
and improve parent involvement and school quality, our school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the 
school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to schools to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in our Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, 
Parent-Teacher Association and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and 
ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; 

  maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator 
will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who attend our school 
and will work to ensure that our school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent 
Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report 
with the central office.; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home; 

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed.

o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.

I:  Direct Instruction  
In analyzing our Teachers College Reading assessments as well as the ELL Data Analysis Tool, 
we have crafted an after-school and Saturday Program that will increase not only the reading 
levels of students but also their progress on the NYSESLAT.  
After-school (Leveled Literacy): 
We analyzed our Teachers College Reading assessments from the end of the 2018 school year. 
According to our end of year data analysis of reading levels, only 25.07% of our English 
Language Learners (ELLs) are reading on our above reading level. In order to target ENL 
students in grades 1-5, reading at a benchmark 1, these students will be offered the opportunity 
for a Leveled Literacy after-school program. The English Language proficiency levels of the 
students in the groups will vary. The program will run in three cycles (approximately 23 sessions 
each), beginning on September 26, 2018 and ending on June 20, 2019. The language of 
instruction will be English. Three ENL certified teachers will be instructing students and 
monitoring progress. The teachers will work with approximately two groups of students a 
session, the groups will not exceed six students in each. At the end of each cycle , reading levels 
will be analyzed and students making progress will then either continue for another cycle, or 
receive small group targeted instruction during the school day. The program that will be used is 
Leveled Literacy Instruction.  
After-school (Lexia & Small Group Instruction): 
Our Transitional Bilingual classes have many students who are recently arrived to the 
country. These students have varied needs in regards to their literacy in their native language as 
well as in English.  In addition to the Leveled Literacy after-school, two after-school classes will 
focus on students in our TBE classes in grades from 2-5. The program will run beginning on 
September 26, 2018 and ending on June 20, 2019. The language of instruction will be English 
through the Lexia program, the small group instruction will be in English or Spanish, dependent 
on student need. There will be two teachers with approximately twenty students each, they will 
be certified in either Bilingual Education or ENL. In order to provide the small group instruction 
in Spanish (if/when needed), the teachers should be fluent in Spanish. The instructional material 
used during the After School Program is an English as a Second Language web-based program 
called Lexia.  The students will practice Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening skills 
utilizing I-pads or laptops.   Lexia tracks their progress, identifies areas in need of improvement 
and differentiates instruction by level. 
Saturday Academy: 
In order to support our English Language Learners in making academic gains on the New York 
State English Language Arts (ELA) and Math tests,  and to attain proficiency  on the New York 
State Identification Test for English Language Learners (NYSESLAT) , an English Language 
Learner Saturday Enrichment Program is offered to ELLs in third grade.  The students will meet 
for approximately twenty-five sessions and receive their instruction in English.  There is a 
maximum of twenty-five (25) students per class. The program consists of one hour of Intensive 
English, one hour of Math instruction, a 1/2 hour of ELA/New York State English as a Second 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) preparation and a 1/2 hour of Music 
enrichment.  The program will consist of four third grade classes.  Four teachers in the Saturday 
Academy are English as a New Language (ENL)/Bilingual Certified teachers. The Common 
Branch teachers will work in conjunction with a certified Bilingual/ENL teacher during the 
Intensive English block.  The program will be supervised by an Assistant Principal for 
approximately 25 sessions.The Saturday Academy will begin on November 3, 2018 and end on 
June 22, 2019. Four classes will receive ENL instruction and scaffolding supports in English 
Language Arts (ELA)/Math and Music Enrichment classes for a total of 4 hours.  These classes 
will receive instruction by a certified Bilingual or ENL teacher.

Our goal is to provide quality training and staff development  to all instructional and support 
personnel that will lead to improved teaching and student learning in all subject areas.  Ongoing 
training will be provided to teachers of ENL students in the use of proven instructional strategies, 
methods and techniques that will support ENL learners.   
Last year there was a school-wide initiative on Co-Teaching for English Language Learners and 
Students with Disabilities. Teachers received Professional Development from Andrea Honigsfeld 
and Carol Wertheimer. For this upcoming school year, they will be presenting to the staff in 
order to expand our knowledge base on how to work collaboratively in a co-teaching setting in 
order to impact student achievement. Differentiated professional learning will take place for 
teachers who are new to our school in the Fall. Those teachers will be receiving the book, "Co-
teaching and Collaboration for Teachers of ELLs" and will be attending PD with Carol 
Wertheimer. Staff members who were in our school the prior school year, will be attending PD 
with Andrea Honigsfeld.  
There is also an added focus on how to prepare ELLs to meet and exceed the Next Generation 
Learning Standards.   The following topics will be addressed during staff development in the 
2018-2019 academic school year for teachers of ENL students:•               Danielson's Framework 
for Teaching - Discussion and Questioning techniques•               Use of Thinking Maps in the 
content areas.•               Analysis of data and progress of our ELLs utilizing the Data Analysis 
Tool•               Utilizing Data to target specific modalities in Listening, Speaking, Reading and 
Writing.•               Using language goals in all content areas to meet the Next Generation 
Learning Standards•               NYSESLAT strategies 
Training will occur throughout the academic school year and/or during scheduled professional 
learning meetings. Training may also occur during monthly grade meetings, lunch/Prep 
periods  and/or during ENL program meetings. Additionally, teachers will be given the 
opportunity to attend city-wide conferences addressing the needs of our ELLs. Tentative dates 
for the academic school year   -  12/5, 12/12, 12/19, 1/9, 1/23, and 1/30. Duration: - 2:50 pm -

Begin description here:            
  
Parents are invited to several Parent Orientation meetings that are scheduled and facilitated by 
the ENL/Bilingual Coordinator (Xiomara Leguisamo) along with Martha Jimenez, the Parent 
Coordinator, several times during the school year. Parents are sent letters in their native language 
(templates used for letters are available on the NYCDOE website under the ELL link and then 
modified to include the school letterhead). Letters are sent out indicating 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th 
notice.  Parent Orientation meetings are held in the auditorium and/or the Cafeteria beginning in 
September. The Parent Orientation DVD from the NYCDOE is shown in all the languages 
represented by the parents. ENL funded teachers as well as the Parent Coordinator assist in 
helping the parents fill out the Parent Survey and Program Selection Form and answer any 
questions parents may have. If a parent is unable to attend the Parent Orientations given in the 
school,  the ENL/Bilingual Coordinator will call the parent and attempt to set up a meeting with 
the parent for an individual interview. The parent is again informed verbally that the default 
program is Bilingual if he/she does not sign the Parent Survey and Program Selection Form. The 
Parent Orientations are ongoing as students are registered into the school.  If the initial informal 
interview along with the Home Language Survey indicates that the student is eligible for testing, 
the student will be tested upon registering.  If the results indicate that the student is an ELL, 
parents are asked to remain for an individual Parent Orientation meeting.   Parents have the 
opportunity at this time to learn about the Bilingual, ENL, and Dual Language 
Programs.  Parents are also informed about the new performance standards, curriculum and the 
strategies they can use at home to improve language learning. 
The Parent Coordinator (Martha Jimenez) provides the parents with a variety of workshops to 
facilitate a closer relationship between the school and the community.  The parents are informed 
about all the current instructional programs available for their children and support services 
within the school.   Martha Jimenez facilitates and presents parenting workshops, family literacy 
programs and informs our school community with the need to have a safety/emergency plan for 
their household.  The parents are informed of workshops, activities and special events via 
monthly calendars and newsletters.  Calendars and newsletters are sent in English, Spanish and 
Chinese.    In addition, the school provides translation services through in outside agency during 
parent teacher conferences.  We also have several staff members who speak Spanish/Chinese and 
translate during parent workshops, conferences and meetings. Staff members are also aware that 
they may use the phone translation services in the Main Office or in the offices of the Assistant 
Principals.  It is the strong desire of P.S. 16 to provide the parents/guardians of our students with 
extensive opportunities to attend a variety of Reading, Writing, Mathematics, Technology and

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
To support our parent community, we will also offer a series of parent workshops to grades K, 1 
and 2.For the Workshop component, we will offer a series of eight one hour workshops (with 
different times throughout the year to accommodate the parents) which will address the 
following:1.               Introduction to the NYSESLAT test2.               Helping your child become 
a successful reader 
3.               Reading with your child 
4.               Strategies to support language acquisition in Listening and Speaking  
5.               Interactive workshops to support their child in the content areas.6.               Overview 
of the technological websites/resources available to the students at school and 
at                    home.7.               Oral language development through Songs, Poems, and 
Rhymes8.               Questioning techniques to support student comprehension at home. 
Parent/community involvement:As part of the Saturday Instructional Academy, parents will be 
given the opportunity to visit the Saturday Academy and participate in our end of year 
International Celebration.  This will consist of a dance performance, a chorus show and foods 
from the different cultures in our school community.  
(Sessions and number of participants)The parents are invited for class visits on a monthly basis, 
at least 1 monthly workshop by grade is provided to them on Math, ELA, testing strategies, and 
in Technology.  In addition, parents are also invited to workshops on the utilization of reading 
strategies, word study and mathematical concepts, in order to support their children at 
home.   Throughout the year, we have approximately 10 – 15 sessions, and in attendance we 
have an average of 50 participants.   We gear our workshops to the different needs of our parents 
and develop hands-on and useful activities for parents to utilize at home.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
PS 16 utilizes the Fountas & Pinnell assessment tool in reading for all ELL students. The assessment is done in English and for 
grades K-2 it is also done in Spanish.  The ELL students in Bilingual and Dual Language programs in grades 3 -5 are also assessed 
with the DRA in Spanish to ascertain their Spanish reading level since Fountas & Pinnell is not available in Spanish for those 
grades. Beginning in the 2017-2018 school year, the TCRWP assessment will replace Fountas and Pinnell.  
Insights: 
•     ELL students who are proficient readers in their native language tend to increase in English reading level at a faster rate. 
•     ELL students who are illiterate in their native language have lower reading levels in English and progress at a slower pace. 
•     ELL students have difficulty with inference.  
  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

There are ongoing Professional Development cycles facilitated by our Literacy Coach, Cara Walker, who is an ENL certified 
teacher. The cycles offered are based on assessment data, teacher interests and administrative observations based on the 
Danielson Rubric. Based on assessment data, cycles are offered that target the needs of the ENL students and teachers. In 
order to insure that the assessments are done with fidelity, teachers are normed to make sure that the assessment is accurate 
across the entire school.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At the start of the school year, the ENL department reviews the results of the NYSESLAT data and distributes this information 
to all classroom teachers, cluster teachers and other providers such as resource room teachers. The ESL/Bilingual Coordinator 
schedules a grade meeting with each grade to inform teachers on how to interpret the various NYSESLAT reports and how to 
utilize them to drive and differentiate instruction. This year, the NYSESLAT reports were shared via Google for Education so 
that teachers could see their students areas of need across the four modalities.   
The school report card and other NYSED standardized testing information disaggregated to show how ELL students performed 
are also used to assess the success of our programs for ELLs.  We also utilize: 
* Fountas & Pinnell reading level assessments on a quarterly basis 
* Writing benchmarks and subsequent writing pieces 
* Unit assessments in math, science and social studies 
* Teacher observations and conferencing notes 
  
P.S. 16Q has been recognized by the NYCDOE DELLSS as a model dual language school. During the 2015-2016 school year, we 
received a grant for $10,000 and were visited by Deputy Chancellor Milady Baez who commissioned a video of our program. As 
a model dual language school, we are currently hosting tours and Q & A sessions for visitors from other schools who are 
planning on opening a dual language program in their schools or who are looking to improve their dual language program. 
As a school community, several meetings are held to discuss the data and to inform changes that will address ELL student 
achievement 
  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Grade-level teams analyze the summative data, meeting bi-weekly, to develop intervention plans and utilize formative data 
including: Fountas and Pinnell Reading Assessment; student writing and Benchmarks: Unit Assessments in Math, Social Studies 
and Science; as well as teacher observation and conferring notes. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
An RTI team is in place to identify and serve ELL students who have academic difficulty and who continue to have academic 
struggles after other interventions have failed. The RtI team members are: 
* Lisa Zuccalmaglio, AP 
* Tania Ottomanelli, AP 
* Alicia Toscano,RtI Intervention Specialist 
* Brenna Gormley, RtI Intervention Specialist 
* Maria Luna, RtI Intervention Specialist 
* Jourdan McGee, IEP Consultant  
* Nicole Lopez, School Psychologist 
Our school begins with the Universal Screening, which is administered to all students.  As the Universal Screen, our school uses 
Fountas & Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System. The NYC Baseline Performance Assessment is used as part of the Universal 
Screen. Beyond the information from the HLIS, the Universal Screening is used to flag students whose literacy skills are below 
grade level. English Language Learners are flagged as needing additional support in literacy in conjunction with language 
services.  Our RTI teachers utiliize Lexia Learning, Raz Kids, and Leveled Literacy Intervention.  
Tier I Instruction 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

English Language Learners receive Tier I instruction by the general education teacher and a certified ENL teacher.  We have 
two models for Tier I instruction of English Language Learners.  We have several self-contained English as a New Language 
classes taught by a certified ENL teacher as well as classes using the push-in model.  An ENL teacher pushes into English classes 
in order to provide the ENL services to those students in need of them, for the time mandated as determined by students' 
NYSITELL and NYSESLAT score.  Both the classroom teacher and ENL teacher provide differentiated targeted instruction based 
on the needs of both the literacy and language needs of the students.  Based on research to best meet the needs of 
linguistically diverse populations, ELL students are exposed to a curriculum that teaches both language and literacy across 
content areas.  Lessons are made meaningful through hands-on and authentic experiences. ELLs are given instruction that is 
cognitively challenging, but with instructional supports such as picture cues, total physical response, peer support, and 
scaffolded instruction.  English language learners develop language through conversations with the teacher and with peers. 
Tier II Instruction     
Using data from the documentation of Tier I instruction and the Universal Screen, the RtI team determines if the ELL student 
needs more intensive support in Tier II.  We use a pull-out/push-in RtI model. ELLs who are determined to be in need of more 
intensive differentiated instruction will receive Tier II instruction three times a week for a minimum of 30 minutes in small 
groups of no more than five students from a highly qualified teacher.  As part of the Tier II instruction, we use The 
Comprehension Toolkit Reading Intervention Program, which is a research based literacy program addressing the following 
literacy components: sight word instruction, comprehension, phonics, vocabulary instruction, and fluency.  ELLs are monitored 
for progress once a month and changes are made to instruction based on the assessments.  The RtI team meets monthly to 
discuss student progress.   Parents are notified via a letter in their preferred language that their child has been placed in Tier 
II.  
Tier III Instruction     
English Language Learners who are not thriving after a minimum of nine weeks in Tier II are then brought to the attention of 
the RtI team. The RtI team discusses data from the progress monitoring assessments given during Tier II. The RtI team uses the 
data to discuss how Tier III interventions can help the student overcome his/her difficulties.  We use a pull-out RtI model.  ELLs 
who are determined to be in need of more intensive differentiated instruction will receive Tier III instruction four times a week 
for 45 minutes in small groups of no more than three students from a highly qualified teacher.  As part of the Tier III 
instruction, we use The Comprehension Toolkit Reading Intervention Program, Great Leaps, The Fluent Reader (Tim Rasinski) 
and Scholastic's Text Talk which are research based literacy programs addressing the following literacy components: sight 
word instruction, comprehension, phonics, vocabulary instruction, and fluency.  Additionally, in order to meet the language 
needs of ELLs we have incorporated Lexia Learning, which is a software program focusing on language development.  ELLs are 
monitored for progress once a month and changes are made to instruction based on the assessments.  The RtI team meets 
monthly to discuss student progress.   Parents are notified in writing, in their preferred language, of their child's placement in 
Tier II intervention.   
If the student continues to demonstrate persistent difficulties despite the additional interventions in Tier II and Tier III over a 
suitable period of time, the child is recommended to our School Based Support Team (SBST) in order to determine if the child 
is in need of a comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluation.  We view RtI as a problem solving model, rather than a special 
education pre-evaluation and make every effort to determine specific language/literacy challenges faced by individual English 
Language Learners who are not making sufficient progress.  We believe in a focused problem-solving model that provides 
students with increasingly intensive, targeted instruction and ongoing progress monitoring that is created to meet their 
individual language/literacy needs. 
  
The RtI cycles vary from 8 -12 weeks for Tier I and from 10 - 20 weeks for Tiers II and III. The RtI team meets on a monthly basis 
to discuss and evaluate student progress and issues.  
  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
•     NYSITELL: Students who scored at an Intermediate level usually progress to an Advanced level and some test out within 
the first administration of the NYSESLAT 
•     NYSITELL: Students who scored at a Beginner level usually remain Beginners or move up to Intermediate on the first 
administration of the NYSESLAT. Also, students who have had prior academic experience in their native language and who do 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

not pass the NYSITELL usually perform at a proficient level on the Spanish Lab. 
•     NYSESLAT:  It becomes increasingly difficult for students to pass the NYSESLAT as they move up in grade.  
•     NYSESLAT:  Some students remain an Advanced for two consecutive administrations of the NYSESLAT. 
•     NYSESLAT:  Newcomers from other non-English speaking countries rarely pass the NYSESLAT the first 2 – 4 years of 
administration. However, if the ELL is literate in his/her native language, then they can possibly reach a Proficient within the 
first or second NYSESLAT administration. 
 
•                ELA and Math: The use of the EDAT allows our school to create targeted ENL programs to address the needs of the 
students. Our Saturday program was created specifically for ENL students who are in the Transitional Level. In addition to the 
Saturday program, three morning programs were created this past year. One program was a Newcomers program for students 
in Grades 3-5. This program was limited to recently arrived students, this same group will remain together the following school 
year. Our second morning program was for our first grade TBE students and targeted oral language development as well as 
guided reading instruction in both Spanish and English. For our TBE students Entering and Emerging Level students in grades 3-
5, they attended a morning program which focused on using Raz-Kids and Lexia to help develop their phonemic awareness and 
fluency in English.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Once the EDAT is completed (prior to the beginning of the school year), the administrative team will meet to discuss the 
EDAT and the findings. Once the administrative team meets to discuss the findings, a PD date for the staff will be created. 
School wide the EDAT will be explained through a PD provided by Mrs. Ottomanelli and Ms. Leguisamo. This will insure that all 
staff members are aware of how the EDAT can help guide instruction for students. After the initial PD in September, teachers 
will be provided with copies of the EDAT for the students they service.  When there are changes to class rosters, updated 
versions will be provided to teachers.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students are grouped heterogeneously by mixed proficiency levels  in the self-contained freestanding ENL classes. In 
Freestanding ENL classes that are serviced by a push-in ENL specialist, students are grouped homogeneously by 
NYSESLAT proficiency level in order to provide the mandated units of ENL service. All instruction in this program is 
delivered in English.  
 
For proficiency level  Beginner/Entering,   Integrated and stand-alone ENL delivery equals a total of 360 minutes per 
week with 180 minutes each for Stand-alone and Integrated ENL/ELA. 
  
For proficiency level Intermediate/Emerging, ENL equals a total of 360 minutes per week: Stand-alone = 90 minutes, 
Integrated ENL = 180 minutes, and a Flexible 90 minutes which can be used with Stand-alone, Integrated ENL/ELA  or 
any other content area.  
  
For proficiency level Intermediate/Transitioning, ENL equals 180 minutes per week: Integrated ENL/ELA = 90 minutes

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Students are grouped heterogeneously by mixed proficiency levels.  Instruction in this program is delivered in English 
and Spanish as per proficiency levels of the students.  The TBE Language Allocation is as outlined below, and is organic 
according to the progress made during the year. The TBE Language Allocation is expected to change as ELL students 
acquire proficiency and are assessed by the teacher utilizing formal and informal instruments such as the F&P or 
DRA,  end of unit assessments, and writing rubrics:  
*  beginner/entering = 25% English / 75% Spanish model is used 
*  low intermediate/emerging = 40% English /60% Spanish model is used 
*  intermediate/transitioning = 50% English / 50% Spanish model is used 
*  advanced/expanding = 75% English / 25% Spanish model is used 
  
At P.S. 16Q, ELL students in a TBE program receive Math and Social Studies/Science in Spanish (within their regular 
class) and ELA in English. Traditional enrichment or prep courses (Art, Music, Physical Education, Library, Social 
Studies, Science and Computer Lab) are delivered in English.  
  
For proficiency level beginning/entering, 360 minutes per week of Stand-alone and Integrated ENL are provided.  
For proficiency level low intermediate / emerging, 360 minutes per week:  90 minutes of Stand-alone, 180 minutes of 
Integrated ENL and 90 flexible minutes to be used in either Stand-alone or Integrated.  
For proficiency level intermediate / transitioning, 180 minutes per week of Integrated and Flexible programming are 
provided: 90 minutes for Integrated ENL and 90 minutes flexible. 
For proficiency level advanced / expanding, 180 minutes  per week in Integrated ENL.  
  
ELL students in the TBE program also receive 1 HLA class across all English proficiency levels. Bilingual instruction in 
Math and Social Studies/Science is delivered across all English proficiency levels with a change from 2 to 1 content 
area subject once students reach the intermediate/transitioning and advanced/expanding levels.  
  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Students are grouped heterogeneously by mixed proficiency levels. Integrated and stand-alone ENL are implemented 
in the English component of the Dual Language program. There are twelve (12) Dual Language classes: two in 
Kindergarten (K-2DL & K-3DL), two in first grade (1-2DL & 1-3DL), two in second grade (2-2DL & 2-3 DL), two in third 
grade (3-2DL & 3-3DL, two in fourth grade (4-2DL & 4-3DL) and two in fifth grade (5-2DL & 5-3DL).   
  
Dual Language program is implemented using a 50- 50 model.  Classrooms include students who are native English 
speakers and native Spanish speakers.  Students in each class alternate between Spanish and English on alternate 
days: for example the 3-2 DL will begin week one with the English teacher on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and 
the Spanish teacher on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The 3-3DL will begin week one with the Spanish teacher on 
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and the English teacher on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The following week the 
groups alternate. 
  
All ELL students in DL programs develop their second-language skills while learning content knowledge in both 
languages. ELL students in the DL program receive ENL within the program itself. Small group instructional setting is 
used to give ELL students the mandated instructional time as per their proficiency levels.   
For proficiency level beginning/entering, 360 minutes per week of Stand-alone and Integrated ENL are provided.  
For proficiency level low intermediate / emerging, 360 minutes per week:  90 minutes of Stand-alone, 180 minutes of 
Integrated ENL and 90 flexible minutes to be used in either Stand-alone or Integrated.  
For proficiency level intermediate / transitioning, 180 minutes per week of Integrated and Flexible programming are

provided: 90 minutes for Integrated ENL and 90 minutes flexible. 
For proficiency level advanced / expanding, 180 minutes  per week in Integrated ENL.  
  
ALL students are initially placed by parental choice as stated in the Parent Survey and Program Selection form. All 
time allocations for each program adhere to the the mandates set forth in the NYS CR Part-154. 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Explicit ESL is delivered in each program as follows: 
•  Transitional Bilingual Programs:  There are four (4) Transitional Bilingual classes in grades K-5. Students in these classes are 
placed heterogeneously and grouped within the class according to ability in reading and native language arts to meet 
individual needs. Academic instruction is in both English and the native language which at P.S. 16 is Spanish.  Classroom 
libraries consisting of children’s literature in Spanish including fiction, poetry, and non-fiction books that appeal to a variety of 
different interests are present.   
  
Our Transitional Bilingual program includes an ESL component for all students and also requires a higher amount of ESL 
instruction for students testing at levels 1 and 2.  Transitional Bilingual students will also continue to receive instruction in 
English in traditional enrichment or prep courses, such as Art, Music, Computer Lab, and Physical Education.  As students 
acquire English, the amount of academic instruction in English increases, which helps ensure that they will have the necessary 
skills to exit the program and to succeed academically in English.   
  
Students starting with limited English spend either 30 or 40 percent of their time in English language development with 
instruction in the native language starting at  70 or 60 percent.  As mandated by Regulation Part 154, advanced ELLs receive 
180 minutes (4 periods per week) of instruction in Native Language Arts and 180 minutes (4 periods per week) of ESL 
instruction. Also, beginner and intermediate ELLs receive 360 minutes (8 periods per week) of ESL instruction and 180 minutes 
(4 periods per week) of Native Language Arts. Any content area instruction in English, in subjects such as math, will utilize ESL 
methodologies and other supports.  The ratio of English to native language instruction increases according to the student’s 
English language proficiency until the student is ready to exit the program.  Additional ESL support is provided after school and 
on Saturdays.  Exit from this program is targeted at three years or less.   
  
•  Freestanding ENL: 
In grades K-5, there are ICT classes with ENL students, Self-contained special education classes with ENL students and 
freestanding ENL classes.  
*ICT Classes with ENL Students- 13 total, six of the classes have a certified TESOL teacher, the remaining classes are serviced by 
an ENL push-in provider. 
*Self-contained Special Education classes- 9 total, three of the classes have a certified TESOL teacher, the remaining classes are 
serviced by an ENL push-in provider. (The classes are self-contained for special education not by ELL status. Teachers pushing-
in follow the mandated time restrictions as per student proficiency as delineated in Part 154.) 
*Freestanding ENL classes- 12 total,  five  of the teachers are TESOL certified, the rest of the classes are serviced by ENL push-
in provider.  
 
Students in Free Standing ESL programs receive all instruction in English. Language Arts is taught using ESL and ELA 
methodologies. Content area instruction is in English using ESL strategies.    
  
•  Dual Language Programs:  There are twelve (12) Dual Language classes: two in Kindergarten (K-2DL & K-3DL), two in first 
grade (1-2DL & 1-3DL), two in second grade (2-2DL & 2-3 DL), two in third grade (3-2DL & 3-3DL, two in fourth grade (4-2DL & 
4-3DL) and two in fifth grade (5-2DL & 5-3DL).  For the 2017-2018 all classes will be following the Teacher’s College Reader’s 
and Writer’s Workshop models in reading and writing which employ a balanced approach to literacy. A 50-50 program model 
is used . 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

  
During a two and half-hour daily block, there is a half-hour of skills instruction, a one-hour reading workshop and a one-hour 
writing workshop. The workshops are designed to make sure students develop strong reading and writing skills in many 
different genres. In addition, ESL strategies such as, TPR, visuals, cooperative learning, prior knowledge, and modeling are 
aligned to the program. 
  
Dual Language Academic instruction during the school day is a 50- 50 model of English and Spanish.  Classrooms include 
students who are native English speakers and native Spanish speakers. Students in each class alternate between Spanish and 
English on alternate days: for example the 3-2 DL will begin week one with the English teacher on Mondays, Wednesdays, and 
Fridays and the Spanish teacher on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The 3-3DL will begin week one with the Spanish teacher on 
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and the English teacher on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The following week the groups 
alternate. 
  
All students in DL programs develop their second-language skills while learning content knowledge in both languages. ELL 
students in the DL program receive ESL within the program itself. Small group instructional setting is used to give ELL students 
the mandated instructional time as per their proficiency levels.  
     
  
 ELL students are served by ESL teachers who follow a push-in model: 
•  English as a Second Language Programs – Push-in Model: ESL instruction is provided by six (6) licensed ESL teachers who 
service 22 classes from Kindergarten to 5th Grade. Eligible ELL students in grades K – 5 receive two periods (90 minutes) per 
day of ESL if they are in the Beginner or Intermediate Level and for advanced leveled students one period per day 
(45mintues).  All academic instruction during the school day is in English.  Six of the Kindergarten classes are housed at our 
annex located at the Reform Temple of Forest Hills - all classes contain ELL students and they are serviced by an ESL certified 
teacher, via the push-in model, that remains in that location. One of the Kindergarten annex teacher is TESOL certified, thus 
providing services for her class. 
  
Core content areas are taught using ESL methodologies that allow for the acquisition of academic material. 
  
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   In our TBE & DL programs - Math, Science and Social Studies are delivered in the native language of Spanish. The math 
program is GoMath in all grades.  
        Social Studies in Spanish: 
         * First Grade - Houghton-Mifflin Hardcourt - Estudios Sociales Familias de Hoy y Ayer: Ciudad de Nueva York 
         * Second Grade - Houghton-Mifflin Hardcourt - Communities   
         * Third Grade - Houghton-Mifflin Hardcourt - Ciudad de Nueva York: Comunidades del Mundo Actual y Del Pasado  
        * Fourth Grade - Houghton-Mifflin Hardcourt - Ciudad de Nueva York: Historia Y Gobierno de Nueva York  
        * Fifth Grade - Houghton-Mifflin Hardcourt - Ciudad de Nueva York: Estados Unidos, Canada, y America Latina 
         In our Dual Language program - core content is delivered in both English and Spanish according to alternating schedule.  
        In our Freestanding ENL program - core content is delivered in English at all times. 
         
        For the upcoming school year, all classes will utilize the Teachers College Literacy Program. All programs utilize the 
GoMath program.  
        All grades and programs utilize the FOSS Kit for Science. In addition, NYC Scope and Sequence in Science and Social Studies 
are utilized for planning and assessing student knowledge.  
  
        Instructional approaches embed ENL methodologies to make content comprehensible, foster language development and

        * Modeling 
        * Use of technology: Promethean boards, iPads, overhead projector  
        * Use of software programs: Imagine Learning 
  
         All instruction is delivered by appropriately highly-qualified certified teachers. All classroom teachers and out of 
classroom teachers are provided with staff development focused on how to provide effective instruction for ELLs.  
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home language with assessment tools that are used according to specific grade: 
*For Kindergarten through 2nd Grade the Fountas & Pinnell language/literacy assessment in Spanish is utilized. 
*For Grades 3 - Grade 5, the Spanish DRA 2. We currently do not have a native language assessment for the low incidence 
languages. 
In addition, for Grade 3 - Grade 5 bilingual and dual language classes, the E.L.E. in Spanish is used in the Spring of the current 
school year. 
 
Our K - 2 TBE and DL Spanish Component teachers also utilize the Estrellita phonics program. Estrellita is a supplemental, 
phonics-based, accelerated beginning Spanish reading program for bilingual classrooms based on scientific learning and 
reading principles, Estrellita provides multisensory, in depth instruction in phonemic awareness, phonics and fluency. Because 
it was designed to meet the needs of children at all skill levels, layers of differentiated instruction are built into the program to 
accommodate Tier 1, 2 and 3 students. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Based on the EDAT, for the school year 2017-2018, approximately 6 students were identified as SIFE. In order to meet their 
needs, the following actions will be taken: 
•   Title III Early Morning Program- students will resume in their morning program that is specifically for this subgroup.  
•     Leveled libraries in the classrooms that range from two levels below to one level above the SIFE student’s identified 
reading level 
•     Guidance Counselor will provide an emotional as well as affective factors profile of the SIFE student 
•     SIFE students will be screened for learning disabilities 
•     Cultural and family background will be addressed for a complete picture of SIFE student 
•     Differentiated instruction – grouping by ability, need(s), and targeted skills

In the school year of 2015 - 2016 approximately 185 Former ELLs were identified as having tested proficient on the NYSESLAT 
2015 or Commanding on the NYSESLAT 2016. They will continue to receive explicit ELL instruction when placed in a self-
contained freestanding ESL classroom. Former ELLs receive, for the next two years,  testing accommodations as per NYSED on 
City and State exams as well as in classroom assessments.  Now, with the amendments made to the CR-Part 154, former ELLs 
will also be entitled to ENL services for the next two years since passing the NYSESLAT. These students will receive .5 units per 
week (2 periods/per week) of ENL in ELA.  They are also invited to the After-school and Saturday academic programs targeting 
Literacy and Math. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
For ELLs  identified as having Special Needs/Students with Disabilities, the following strategies and grade-level materials are 
utilized: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

•    Nine (9) self-contained Special Education classes with ELLs.  
•    Fifteen (15) ICT clasess containing ELLs with IEPs. 
•     Resource Room intervention in reading and mathematics within a small group instructional setting as well as RTI Tiered 
Interventions 
•     ESL push-in with small group instructional setting using research-based ESL methodology. Also use of technology such as 
Promethean Board, iPads, videos and software (Lexia Learning).  
•     Extended Day Program (Wednesdays - Thursdays) 
•     One-to-One tutoring 
•     Peer assisted tutoring 
•     Familiarization with students IEP to be aware of students learning disabilities and modifications  
•     Regular ongoing conferencing with Speech and other related service personnel that student receives services from to 
better track student’s progress and target needs are also addressed through differentiated instruction using ReadyGen and 
GoMath 
  
Materials used in Tier 3 are used by the classroom teacher in self-contained Special Education classes which include Great 
Leaps, The Fluent Reader (Tim Rasinski) and Scholastic's Text Talk which are research based literacy programs addressing the 
following literacy components: sight word instruction, comprehension, phonics, vocabulary instruction, and 
fluency.  Additionally, in order to meet the language needs of ELLs we have incorporated Lexia Learning, which is a software 
language development/acquisition program, during afterschool on Wednesdays and Thursdays.  
   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Fifteen (15) full-day ICT classrooms in Grades K - 5 and five (5)  Resource Room classrooms in Grades 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 contain 
ELL-SWD students who are designated to be in the least restrictive environments. For ELL-SWD students in ICT classrooms in 
Grades 1, 3, and 4 a State Certified Teacher who holds a TESOL license co-teaches with a State Certified Special Education 
teacher. General Education non-ELL students are grouped with heterogeneous grouping of ELLs  in the ICT class so as to adhere 
to the values of the program. In classrooms where students are receiving SETTS services, a State Certified Special Education 
teacher provides services to these students. The Special Education Supervisor, Lisa Zuccalmaglio, flexibly schedules ELL-SWD 
students as per their IEPs.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
P. S. 16 supports the ELLs in ELA, Math and Content Areas.  The performance and progress in mathematics state exam declined 
this year so we will continue to incorporate the following intervention services: Classroom teachers provide Tier I 
differentiation on a daily basis within the components the GoMath program and through the utilization of  web based Think 
Central.  End of unit assessments in GoMath are monitored to identify students not progressing in Mathematics 
development.  Tier II intervention will be provided to students 2-3 times per week, within cycles, in small group by one, full 
time academic specialist for our Special Education ELLs in grades 3-5 and level one students in grade 5. Students will also be 
mandated to attend 37.5 minutes and are invited to the After-school program. 
  
ELL students identified to be at-risk, receive additional support in after school classes three days per week. Students work on 
Reflex Math and DreamBox Learning, web-based programs, to further skills development in Mathematics. All ELLs in grades 3-5 
are provided Extended Day Intervention that offer support in ELA and Math. 
 
In ELA, our ELLs receive Tier I differentiation on a daily basis within the component of balanced literacy instruction delivered 
via the Teachers College Readers and Writers Workshop.  Students literacy levels are identified through the  Fountas & Pinnell 
assessment. Students more than one year below grade level and students not evidencing continued growth are referred for 
Tier II intervention throughout the school day.  These interventions are matched to the needs of students based upon the 
assessment results.  The array of available intervention programs include; Wilson, Leveled Literacy Intervention for level 1 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

students in Grades 1 and 2;  Fundations for  Tier I in small groups; Great Leaps one –to- one tutoring with paraprofessionals; 
RAZ Kids; Lexia Learning- Computer based learning.  A school subscription to Brainpop and Brainpop ESL is utilized by all 
students.  
  
Services are rendered in English with native language support when available. 
  
An ELL Saturday Academy was created to target students in Grades 4 and 5 who are Expanding according to the 2016 
NYSESLAT results. These students received instruction from TESOL certified teachers and had an music based enrichment 
period.  
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are researching an ENL literacy program for the use of the ENL push-in providers with their ELL students. The program is 
called English Now - on hold due to budget. 
ENL teachers meet with the Principal once a month to discuss issues concerning assessing ELLs on an ongoing basis, whether 
the Second Language Acquisition is working, results of LexiaLearning reports on student usage and progress tracking, plan 
parent workshops focusing on helping their ELLs at home, and professional development opportunities.  
    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We are not discontinuing any of the programs we have in place for ELLs. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are an integral part of PS 16Q. We are a school of current ELLs, Former ELLs and very little non-ELLs. All of our students 
are immigrants or children of immigrants.  It is our policy that all students can learn and all students can and will achieve. Every 
classroom has access to art, chorus, drama, physical education, readers theater, field trips, residencies, technology and a wide 
variety of intervention programs during regular day school and After-school. 
 
After-school programs for ELLs include classes for ELL students in Grades 4-5 with a TESOL NYS Certified teacher using the

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native Language support is delivered according to the NYS mandates 
TBE:  Math and Science are delivered in a student's native language (Spanish) with an ongoing emphasis on reading and 
writing. Depending on students' literacy levels and needs, a model of 2 days English and 3 days Spanish is implemented with a 
shift to 3-4 days English and 1-2 days Spanish as the year progresses. 
DL:  A 50-50 program model is followed. Native language (Spanish) is delivered full day basis depending on the cohort's 
schedule.  
ESL: Delivered when classroom teacher and/or push-in ESL teacher speaks the native language of student.  
  
Native language is also supported through native language in-classroom libraries and dictionaries. We have a healthy library 
that includes non-fiction and fiction texts in native languages for teachers and students to access.   
  
Curriculum and unit letters to parents are translated and available in Spanish and Chinese.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

P.S. 16 assures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each program 
through: 
•Seven TESOL licensed teachers following a push-in model and servicing ELLs within small group instruction one two two 
periods per day for five days 
•Twelve (12) self-contained freestanding ESL classes with ESL licensed teachers who provide ESL methodology in whole class 
and small group instruction 
•Four (4) Transitional Bilingual Education classes where proficiency levels as well as Native Language Arts are taken into 
account when allocating time for instruction.  
•NYState mandated time constraints are used when programming instructional minutes for each class and each proficiency 
level 
All programs that are implemented correspond to the students’ grade level and academic needs.  Programs are researched 
based and approved by New York City Department of Education.  The programs allow for an initial assessment to ascertain 
areas of strengths and weaknesses followed by a prescribed plan that targets the deficiencies.  Therefore, they are geared for 
individualized instruction.  
  
The materials utilized in each classroom are grade and age appropriate and are research-based and Common Core aligned. 
Teachers are provided with pacing calendars are are able to modify the pacing as necessary to address their students' needs. 
Teachers are also strongly encouraged and professionally developed, on a continuos basis, to scaffold and differentiate 
content material and instruction.  
   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
All newly enrolled students are welcomed by either Xiomara Leguisamo, ENL Coordinator or Tania Ottomanelli, Assistant 
Principal of the ENL Department.  
School counselors and also our Parent coordinator are readily available to address the needs of our newly enrolled ELLs.  
Also, plans to incorporate a newcomer class as a regular classroom setting for those ELLs that are SIFE and/or have had no 
formal instruction/education.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Currently electives are not offered.  
     
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Dual Language Programs:  There are twelve (12) Dual Language classes: two in Kindergarten (K-2DL & K-
3DL), two in first grade (1-2DL & 1-3DL), two in second grade (2-2DL & 2-3 DL), two in third grade (3-2DL 
& 3-3DL, two in fourth grade (4-2DL & 4-3DL) and two in fifth grade (5-2DL & 5-3DL).  All classes follow

the Teacher’s College Reader’s and Writer’s Workshop models in reading and writing which employ a 
balanced approach to literacy. Grade K - 2 use Fountas & Pinnell for English and Spanish literacy 
assessment and Grades 3 -5 use Fountas & Pinnell for English literacy assessment and DRA for Spanish 
literacy assessment. A 50-50 program model is used. Teachers in K - 2 TBE and Spanish DL classrooms also 
utilize Estrellita program for assessment and language development in Spanish. 
  
During a two and half-hour daily block, there is a half-hour of skills instruction, a one-hour reading 
workshop and a one-hour writing workshop. The workshops are designed to make sure students develop 
strong reading and writing skills in many different genres. In addition, ESL strategies such as, TPR, visuals, 
cooperative learning, prior knowledge, and modeling are aligned to the program. 
  
Dual Language Academic instruction during the school day is a 50- 50 model of English and 
Spanish.  Classrooms include students who are native English speakers and native Spanish speakers. 
Students in each class alternate between Spanish and English on alternate days: for example the 3-2 DL 
will begin week one with the English teacher on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and the Spanish 
teacher on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The 3-3DL will begin week one with the Spanish teacher on 
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and the English teacher on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The following 
week the groups alternate. 
  
All students in DL programs develop their second-language skills while learning content knowledge in 
both languages. ELL students in the DL program receive ESL within the program itself. Small group 
instructional setting is used to give ELL students the mandated instructional time as per their proficiency 
levels.   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our goal is to provide quality training to all instructional and support personnel that will lead to improved teaching and 
student learning in all subject areas through staff development.  Ongoing training will be provided to all teachers of ELL 
students,  including teachers with non-ELLs in their classrooms,  in the use of proven instructional strategies, methods and 
techniques that will support ELL learners.  We believe that these strategies and techniques benefit all students especially since 
our school has a large percentage of English proficient students are former ELLs. 
  
The following topics will be addressed during staff development Mondays in the 2017-2018 academic school year for all 
teachers. It is our beliefs that the strategies and instructional approaches that help  
  
•     Utilizing Data (Fountas & Pinnell, DRA, Conference notes, pre & post unit assessments, Periodic Assessments) to target 
specific modalities in Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing. 
•     Best practices for teaching ELA and Mathematics to English language learners. 
•     Informal Assessment for evaluating limited English proficient/English language learners’ progress through Imagine Learning 
and  
•               GoMath unit assessments 
•     Using language goals in all content areas.

•     Implementing the different components of the Reader’s and Writer’s Workshop for Dual Language and TBE classrooms and 
Freestanding ESL. 
•     Think Central Training to individualize students instruction through a web based program 
•     Implementation of the Imagine Learning Program in Self Contained ESL and Bilingual classes. 
   
 Teachers will be given the opportunity to attend professional development addressing the needs of our ELLs via the OELL 
workshops offered throughout the year. In addition, teachers are provided with in-house professional development through 
our literacy coaches, math coach and ENL coordinator.  
  
Upon review of the data analysis, P.S. 16 provides ELL students with more educational opportunities for language acquisition 
through its Title III programs offered at different times:  After-school Programs and Saturday Academy.  
  
Highly qualified, regularly licensed teachers in ESL provide ELL students with differentiated instruction and scaffolding 
techniques aligned with research-based ENL methodology to help students acquire language and proficiency.  Teachers are 
also given information support through the guidance counselor, Penny Pappas, in preparing students for the articulation 
process of transitioning into intermediate school. Students are also scheduled by class to go on a tour of the different 
intermediate schools that P.S. 16 feeds into such as I.S. 61, I.S. 73, and I.S. 5.   
  
Attendance is an integral part of learning. For ELL children to maintain progress they must attend programs consistently and 
continuously. To ensure that ELL students receive all the benefits of Title III programs, a procedure to decrease absenteeism is 
ongoing. With the assistance of the Parent Coordinator, the Bilingual/ENL Coordinator and an Administrator, letters and phone 
calls to parents of students who are absent will be made daily to reduce chronic absenteeism that can interfere with the 
progress of ELL students and the goals of the program.   
  
3) 
Through Title III funding, the P.S. 16 Professional Development Program for teachers of ELL students will address both teachers 
working in the supplementary program as well as mainstream educators.  The professional development will focus on 
providing teachers with scaffolding and differentiated instructional strategies for teaching English Language Learners which 
will be based upon current research in the field of Second Language methodology.  Professional Development will also address 
ways to prepare ELLs to meet and exceed standards according the New York State Standards and NYC guidelines.  Teachers 
participating in these workshops will be paid at the training rate.  Teacher trainers and facilitators will receive per session rate. 
  
Topics that will be addressed during these sessions include the following: 
  
1.     Strategies needed to prepare ELLs for success on the NYSESLAT. 
2.     Instructional strategies for differentiated learning. 
3.     Incorporating Word Study through ENL methodology into the Teacher’s College Model. 
4.     Increasing Native Language literacy skills. 
5.     Scaffolding across the Disciplines in each Content Area. 
6.     Using Mathematical Instructional Strategies to enhance student performance on the city and state assessments.  
7.     Building on students’ prior knowledge of language and content. 
8.     Incorporating vocabulary into the Reader’s and Writer’s workshop. 
9.     Developing effective oral language skills in the ENL classroom. 
10.     Connecting children and culture to literacy learning.     
  
Additional Resources and Support 
  
1)     P.S.16Q also supports the learning of ELLs through the use of instructional materials such as: 
•     Leveled libraries in English and Native Language for TBE classes and Dual Language classes 
•     Leveled libraries for Freestanding ENL classes

3)         We utilize the Professional Development opportunities provided by the Office of English Language Learners for both 
Teachers and Supervisors.  
  
Timeline: 
Training will occur during professional development days during our calendar dates, monthly grade conferences and ESL 
program meetings.  In each session there are approximately 9-11 teachers on a grade.   
(Audience)In attendance, we will have Administrators, classroom teachers, ESL providers, Paraprofessionals, Guidance 
Counselors, Special Education teachers, Psychologists, Parent Coordinator, Coaches, Data Specialist, Occupational, Physical and 
Speech Therapists.  Throughout the school year we will have at least a monthly session that incorporates ESL strategies 
through Teachers College, Destination Math and Imagine Learning.  Additionally, teachers will be given the opportunity to 
attend city conferences addressing the needs of our ELLs.  Our secretaries are given training regarding the process of HLIS by 
the ESL/Bilingual Coordinator. 
  
At the start of the school year, teachers are given the data from the prior years.  Teachers consult cross grades and discuss the 
students’ strength and weaknesses to plan accordingly. 
        
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
  
Highly qualified, regularly licensed teachers in ESL provide ELL students with differentiated instruction and scaffolding 
techniques aligned with research-based ENL methodology to help students acquire language and proficiency in 
English.  Teachers are also provided support by the guidance counselors, Alba Zamot and Paul Ramos, in preparing students for 
the articulation process of transitioning into intermediate school. Students are also scheduled by class to go on a tour of the 
different intermediate schools that P.S. 16 feeds into such as I.S. 61, I.S. 73, and I.S. 5.   
  
The administration ensures that all staff receives the mandated time for ELL training during staff development days, in-house 
differentiated professional development, and study groups.  Differentiation of Instruction for ESL students is an in-house ELL 
training workshop presented by staff developers. Teachers received a 3 day SIOP Professional Development. Each day focused 
on different component The above workshop included how to scaffold and differentiate instruction, stages of language 
acquisition, activities related to the different stages of language acquisition and questioning techniques to ensure that each 
child understands what is being taught.   Teachers will continue to receive SIOP Professional Development for the upcoming 
school year to support the work that began the previous year. Another workshop provided previously to the staff was full day 
and half-day sessions with Mary Capellini.  Ms. Capellini supported teachers in tracking ELL progress through careful and 
intense observation of each students speaking and writing components.  The ENL teachers as well as the assistant principals 
provide on going staff development throughout the school year. Staff development presentations provided by the literacy 
coach include: Shared Reading, Universal Design for Learning, and Fundations. All teachers at P. S 16Q have been provided 
with resource materials that they have been studying and using extensively for their classroom instruction.  Administrators,

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Teachers schedule individual conferences with parents of ELLs in order to discuss their child's language development progress 
and language development needs in all content areas. Teachers use Tuesday Parental Engagement time to meet individually 
with students' parents.  Teachers keep individual records of meetings/phone calls/letters in order to ensure that all ELL 
parents/guardians meet at least once individually with the teachers.    
  
Spanish and Chinese interpreters are available upon request using the request system in place as stated in our Language 
Interpretation and Translation Policy document.  
   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

  
In the fall and throughout the year parents of newly identified ELL students attend an orientation workshop. Parents have the 
opportunity at this time to learn about the Bilingual, ENL, and Dual Language Programs.  Parents are also informed about the 
new performance standards, curriculum and the strategies they can use at home to improve language learning. In September 
and early October,  parents are invited to the Meet the Teacher meeting in the morning. Parents have the opportunity to meet 
their children's teachers and to learn of the daily rituals and routines as well as the academic expectations that they are 
expected to meet and about the state assessments/exams that they will take in the year. All parents are invited on a monthly 
basis to attend Parent Visits to their child's class to participate in end of unit celebrations, goal attainment, or project 
presentations. Parent Visits are also scheduled by Cluster teachers in the content areas as well as by ENL push-in teachers.  
  
The ENL/Bilingual Coordinator has a year-long workshop called Parents as Partners. Parents attend a series of workshops 
aimed at helping parents understand the demands and expectations that their ELL child deals with and has to meet. The 
workshops are interactive and hands-on. For some of the workshops, the ELL child/student attends and works with his/her 
parent. The Coordinator purchases the materials which the parents are able to keep after each workshop.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Elaine Iodice, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Data used includes:  

* Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)  

* RAPL report from ATS indicating the home language of the parents and the language in which they wish to 
receive all correspondance and phone calls.  

* RHLA report from ATS indicating the incidence of different languages in our school  

* A parent letter asking parents to confirm their language preference for communication with the school is also 
utilized  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75 

 

The ESL/Bilingual Coordinator:  

* Conducts initial interviews with parents during registration  

* Reviews HLIS forms  

* Reviews RAPL report  

* After analyzing HLIS and RAPL, informs Principal, Parent Coordinator, and PTA President  

* Also reports, to Assistant Principals, low incidence languages for students in their grades  

* Informs Assistant Principal responsible for testing so that translated tests in Math and Science are ordered. For 
low incidence languages, translators for oral interpretation of tests are requested by the school secretary  

The Parent Coordinator  

* Utilizes School Messenger phone system for high incidence languages - Spanish and English - for brief school 
related notices and announcements  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language

  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

The School Cabinet will oversee that language of preference for each family is documented and recorded within the 
first 30 days of school. The ATS RHLA report will be updated through a parental survey. The results will be kept on file 
in our copy room and the Principal’s office. The HLIS and RAPL will be also be continuosly updated  

* Centrally Produced Critical Documents will be sent home in the language of preference of families. (English and 
Spanish > 10%)  

* Student Critical Documents will be sent home in the language of preference of families.  

* If unable to provide translation, a note informing parents how to request free translation will be attached to the 
document.  

* Interpretation services will be provided by School-based staff in Spanish and Chinese.

* Where School-based translation or interpretation is not available, it will be planned and requested through the NYC 
DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit.  

* All notices of translation and interpretation services are posted at the main entrance and on file, in an accessible 
and labeled binder on the counter of our Main Office.  

* Translation and Interpretation funds will be utilized to support the above-bulleted efforts  

* Three Bilingual (Spanish) school aides are assigned to the main office. They assist the Pupil Accounting Secretary 
with registration and other school-related administrative issues concerning parents. Their responsibilities include 
making teacher/nurse/supervisor-requested phone calls to parents, as well as answering the phones.  

* The Bilingual/ENL Coordinator and two other Bilingual TESOL teachers are available for the Parent Interview upon 
registration of new students. They also provided Parent Orientations in both English and Spanish. Translations of the 
video for low-incidence languages are provided to parents using a laptop or in the computer lab. The NYCDOE 
Translation and Interpretation Unit is also utilized during individual Parent Orientations, which are scheduled in 
advance, so that the parent has the opportunity to understand the information being presented.  

Another resource that we utilize to acquire information and notification documents is the Translation & Interpretation 
intranet site: http://intranet.nycboe.net/schoolsupport/translation_and_interpretation_unit.
