Section 2: Executive Summary and Organizing Principles 

 
The Objective 
The intent of this Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) is to continue to frame a three-year process 
for each Renewal school and design a comprehensive plan that outlines a strategic path to a paradigm shift in each 
school at every level. The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that 
meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school 
can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to 
provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including 
all stakeholders.  
 
The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program: 

  A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff, 

community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity. 
We must all be willing learners. 

  A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence. 
  Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school 

community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal 

  Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school 

environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members. 

  Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work. 
  The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over 

the three year period of renewal. 

 
The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy: 

By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align 
instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.  
Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction, 
school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school 
culture. 

 
The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy: 
In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase 
student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve 
teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and 
increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of 
student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning 
and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal 
schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring 
of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a 
Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and 
expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will 
stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school 
ready and able to learn. 
 
Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) 

The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for 
each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools, 
Strong Communities, including the following: 

  Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19 

RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          5 

 

the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All 
Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping 
benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the 
Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by 
definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership 
demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.  

  Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and 

documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the 
desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.  

  Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes 

and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five 
discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an 
action plan. 

  Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental 

health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school. 

  Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool 

 

and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners. 
Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and 
instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding 
to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students. 
  Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement. 

 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          6 

 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive 
Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for 
continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing 
review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement 
activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students. 
 

 
Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 
 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4) 
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 
 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 

Next Steps for RSCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Renewal school 

and meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs 

assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative 
data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.   

  Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools. 

  Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs 

assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific, 
Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor 
progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school 
community know when you have reached your goal.   

  Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement 

Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections. 

  Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: Renewal School Narrative 

 

In a brief narrative, describe the current state of the Renewal school addressing the following:  

1.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including your school’s mission statement and a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or 
special initiatives being implemented.  

2.  What are the school’s beliefs about student learning? 
3. 
4.  Describe your school’s approach to family engagement and progress made with establishing families as 

Identify any special student populations that the school has and what their specific needs are. 

partners in furthering student achievement  

5.  Describe how your school is leveraging community school partnerships to support progress in elements of the 

Framework for Great Schools and indicate where this has been a challenge. 

6.  Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year. 

Fannie Lou Hamer Middle School’s mission is to prepare students so each student is able to work effectively, think 
critically, and act compassionately to build a better world for themselves and others. We have used this mission to 
align the academic and social emotional practices of the school. To that end, we have cultivated partnerships that 
provide support to teachers, family, staff, and students so that they we can maximize our impact both academically 
and social-emotionally. Partners such as Generation Ready, Teaching Matters, Ramapo, Partnership with Children, 
MSQI, Phipps Neighborhood, and Children’s Aid Society, among others, will continue to work collaboratively to 
support staff, students, and families. 

As a Renewal School, the school has been able to leverage the resources provided to create the academic support to 
students and staff needed to move student performance. In 2018-19, FLHMS’s lead CBO partner will be Partnership 
with Children. As a partner in the school for a number of years, having them as the lead CBO will allow us to continue 
developing systems and structures across the school that support our growing restorative practices initiative by 
expanding it school-wide, supporting our positive behavior intervention system (PBIS) and aligning it with student 
leadership initiatives, and providing wrap-around services to students and families so that all students are in school 
and ready to learn each day. This move consolidates the number of lead partners, streamlining our management 
structure to increase impact for students and families and allowing us to bring on additional staff to serve as Success 
Mentors to students as we continue to work to decrease chronic absenteeism and increase student achievement. 
Partnership with Children has a track record of partnering with schools and using data-driven goal setting to ensure 
we are able to monitor and revise our action plans over the course of the year. 

In addition, Renewal funding from the NYCDOE also helps FLHMS allocate extra funding for special educators, an extra 
ENL teacher, full-time and part-time mentors for teachers, extra guidance and social work staff, teachers leaders, and 
targeted professional development from our partners such as Math Solutions, Generation Ready, and Ramapo. 

Rigorous Instruction: Fannie Lou Hamer Middle School has certain embedded pedagogical strategies that all teachers 
agree support learners to achieve. The Instructional Focus for last year was: "Reading, Speaking and Writing in Every 
Class, Every Day," which motivated all constituencies in the school to rally around this vision of learning. The 
leadership regularly visited classes to see the implementation of this focus. Teachers were trained in the development 
of stronger reading comprehension strategies, student-led discussion techniques and writing strategies. This 
augmented community building structures like common Rules and Procedures and Kagan Cooperative Learning 
Structures. Throughout the school, teachers implemented the Instructional Focus using the "I do, We do, You do" 
methodology in their teaching. This year, using the feedback of our Quality Review, we amended the Instructional 
Focus to: "Reading, Speaking, and Writing in Every Class, Every Day Accessible to Every Student."  

With the Instructional Focus as a guiding purpose, the Leadership has developed a common pedagogical vision. 
Teachers begin with clear models of the day’s objective, known as Learning Target as well as the “Look fors” that are 
the daily criteria of success aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards (or CCLS). During the We do portion of 
the lesson, teachers use Cooperative Learning Structures to stimulate communication between students based on the 
Learning Target and "Look fors." Teachers pose an open-ended question for students to consider and share their 
answers with classmates. Questions are based on the standards and teachers use grade level texts with scaffolds to

allow multiple entry points for different learners. The units are broken up to be “foundational” where students are 
exposed to new concepts and skills, then students need to show their ability to use these new concepts and skills in a 
Summative Assessment that is redrafted with deeper critical thinking into a portfolio piece. Each Summative 
Assessment is designed to be challenging and allow students to show off their mastery in the discipline. As students 
work on their Summative Assessments, teachers build in Cooperative Learning Structures around open-ended 
questions devised by the students to deepen their understanding of the work through conversation. These units are 
based on curriculum from the New York State Engage NY website and include Engage NY Math, Expeditionary 
Learning and Odell. This year teachers will also use the Teachers College approach to writing and integrate their 
Balanced Literacy approach into these CCLS-aligned units. In order to differentiate effectively, teachers meet with co-
teachers (ICT) weekly in order to target specific student groups such as IEP students and ELL’s. Teachers use different 
modalities in order to engage students with different needs and learning styles. For example, ELL's and IEP students 
may also be provided with an audio version of the text. Content areas may also provide translated versions of texts or 
"cloze" tasks to align instruction for ENLs to provide them with an entry point to the material. Teachers received 
training in the new Bilingual Common Core Standards to clarify researched ENL approaches. Teachers respond to 
benchmark assessment data and modify instruction as necessary. Teachers provide work that is aligned to that 
student’s level of mastery (Mastery, Near Mastery, Remediation) as evidenced by the most recent benchmark. For 
learners at Mastery, the task is not modified. Mastery students may receive different tasks or texts to leverage them 
forward. For learners at near mastery and remediation, the teacher may supplement texts and material with videos 
and visuals. Students may be provided with guided notes to help them access the material. These guided notes 
include the Learning Target and appropriate "Look-fors" so students can self-evaluate as they are completing student 
tasks.  

Special Circumstances based on Population: Of the entering the 6 th grade, only 8 entering 6th graders (1%) scored a 
Level 3 or 4 on the 4th grade New York State ELA or Math exam. 80% of students scored a Level 1 and 19% of students 
scored a Level 2.  

In addition, students enter the school with many factors that can create trauma and, thus, make it difficult to learn. 
The school has a Universal Free Lunch status, meaning that over 95% of the students are Title 1 with approximately 
18% designated for "McKinney-Vento" funding. FLHMS has been working to overcome difficult risk factors in multiple 
ways with limited community resources to support the FLHMS families. We provide a safe haven where families can 
get the support they need, where children can be cared for and graduate from a rigorous academic program, and 
teachers can work collaboratively to create common expectations and cultivate Common Core thinking using the 
resources of a school with 268 students. FLHMS has been successful based on the School Snapshot, which shows that 
approximately 80% of FLHMS’ exiting 8th grade students over the last three years have earned enough credits in the 
9th grade to be on track for High School graduation. The added resources from becoming a Renewal School has 
allowed FLHMS to expand programs to provide more support for all students and their families, including a Mental 
Health Clinic and plans for a full-time Registered Nurse in a Health Clinic.  

Effective Leadership – FLHMS is a small community that responds to feedback to leverage forward the academics and 
social emotional well-being of our students. The Quality Review process has helped the Leadership Team and the staff 
to re-structure the school and shift the school from the old New York State Standards to the new Common Core 
Learning Standards both structurally and pedagogically. Last year’s Quality Review lauded the school's Collaborative 
Team model as Well Developed. The school's use of common Inquiry Team structures noted in the prior year's QR 
resulted in the school receiving a Well Developed rating in Collaborative Teacher teams. The school uses a Facilitative 
Leadership model, where the Leadership Team represents all constituencies and then using data and feedback, the 
team creates SMART goals related to literacy, math, student supports and parent involvement. The Leadership Team 
reviewed all of the feedback including the June Instructional Reports. Most recently, the team reviewed the QR and 
PPR to ensure the goals and action plans were aligned and were measurable. In addition, the team summarized the 
goals and action plans, and these were shared in the Leadership Team minutes and emailed in the daily Staff Notes.  

Collaborative Teachers - This work culminated this year when the Principal developed a Professional Development 
plan in June that would allow the full staff to meet later in June to review student work and to pinpoint next steps for 
student achievement. The Principal re-examined the student work from subject area portfolios and the outcomes of 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

the State ELA, where less than 10% of our student body showed grade level achievement. The Principal requested 
that all Vertical Teams meet in the summer to move each team to begin their focus on the standards that students 
were struggling with the most: Reading for Information 1, Reading for Information 2 and Writing for Argument. While 
many standards would be addressed, each team was asked by the Principal to construct a first term Summative 
Assessment that would assess student achievement on RfI 1 for their grade level. After an on-line system of standards 
tracking was implemented, the Principal worked with each Vertical Team to ensure that benchmarks for the standard 
were created and able to be tracked for student achievement, and the Principal provided professional development 
time so Vertical Teams could document the results and make next steps. The results were that students showed 
growth in these targeted standards in each grade level throughout the school. The outcome of this work directly ties 
to our new Instructional Focus as well as the “vision” for how students will develop their ability to Think Critically as 
part of our mission. In addition, the school will build in more data-driven accountability with the support of Talent 
Development. The use of an “Early Warning System” database will allow teachers to provide interventions to students 
in need.  

Supportive Environment - In terms of Social Emotional Learning, FLHMS considers itself a “fortified” community to 
support at-risk students in an at-risk community. District 12 is the poorest urban area in the nation and brain research 
has shown that poverty affects the ability of students to learn. Working with Turnaround for Children for many years, 
we have had professional development about how our student population may be at-risk of trauma from multiple 
sources - poverty, divorce, drug and alcohol abuse at home, violence, homelessness. These are only some of the at-
risk forces to which our students may have been exposed. Creating a safe environment with trusting relationships are 
some of the ways that at-risk students can feel nurtured enough to learn in spite of their environmental conditions. In 
addition to Cooperative Learning Structures and Learning Targets (both are supports for at-risk learners), the school 
has other elements embedded to nurture our students. The school is structured deliberately to enhance community 
and collaboration. For example, students travel together with the same class all year to create a small community of 
learners. In each class, students are deliberately grouped with high, middle and low students for differentiated groups 
- or with same level group for interventions. All classes do team builders for small groups and class builders for full 
groups. Once a day, 15-17 students are paired with one adult during Advisory time. That adult is the bridge between 
home and school for Family Conferences, phone calls home and all other parent communication. Advisory groups do 
team builders as well. All self-contained students are mainstreamed into Advisory. Advisory is a time for goal setting 
around monthly progress reports as well as homework help using on-line programs. Workshops on high school, 
college and career as well as conflict resolution, Internet safety and health education are scheduled either during 
Advisory or class time. These activities are directly related to our Mission of students “Acting Compassionately.”  

Expanded Learning Time – Advisers work together to provide interventions for SE, AIS, PID and ELL students during 
Expanded Learning Time. While advisory usually meets during the school day, some of the activities continue into 
Expanded Learning Time which allows for flexible programming. Advisories can go on trips to colleges, to Nature’s 
Classroom (an overnight outdoor environmental education center in Connecticut), and local museums and parks for 
enrichment. Finally, Advisories collect to compete in fun ways during Town Halls and Field Day or to view one 
another’s performances for Talent Show, Fannie Lou Hamer Day or Black/Women’s History Month. Teachers worked 
with students during ELT to organize Talent Show with student performances from all grades. FLHMS students also 
formed a student government and representatives met during ELT to organize and lobby for issues that are important 
to them. Teachers also organized “clubs” for Foreign Language using Rosetta Stone and Book Clubs. During ELT, 
FLHMS has also been able to develop a wide variety of sport teams to round out our academics, including Girls 
Basketball, Wrestling, and Track & Field. Through our After School program (also during ELT) with Children’s Aid we 
have Boys Basketball and Archery. Children’s Aid also provides a Student Leadership Program, a Video Program tied to 
the Tribeca Film Festival, an “Iron Chef’s” Program as well as a Summer Camp to augment the FLHMS Summer School. 
Because “Acting Compassionately” is so important at FLHMS, we have a Mediation Program that helps students solve 
their conflicts through mediated discussion with the support of our Social Worker and SW interns. CAS provided a co-
ed counseling program for all at-risk students to talk about their feelings on teen related subjects. CAS and FLHMS 
worked collaboratively to provide simultaneous Saturday Programming so parents could take Financial Literacy, ENL 
or Zumba classes while students were getting ELA or Math tutoring from teaching staff. Families also have access to 
immediate outside counseling in the community through TFC after school or on Saturdays. High marks from TFC

surveys as well as from the Learning Environment Survey show that FLHMS is a community that students, parents and 
teachers feel is safe and productive.  

Another initiative that has helped us academically, especially in Extended Learning Time, is the use of technological 
interventions. In addition to Smart Board/Promethean technology that allows teachers immediate access to the 
Internet to provide multiple entry points, student reading and math skills have been enhanced and fluency increased 
using Imagine Learning for ELL’s, myOn and i-Ready for reading comprehension, and using i-Ready and Math Facts for 
math fluency. MyOn and i-Ready also provide non-fiction texts for use in Science and Social Studies as well as audio to 
support learners in accessing grade level text. All students have a gmail account and many teachers use G suite and 
Google Classroom to assign differentiated assignments to their students. This easy access to assignments allows 
Extended Learning Time teachers to individualize assignments with strategic groups of students based on standards 
mastery. FLHMS has worked with CAS so CAS tutors can continue the work with students at their homework help 
sessions. 

Strong Family- School Ties – The school staff is grouped into Grade Teams. Each grade team has 5-6 advisers who 
work exclusively with the families of 15-17 students. These advisers actively make phone calls and outreach to 
families regarding academics and social-emotional issues. The advisers use multiple means to contact families from 
calls to texts to email to letters backpacked to mail home. When progress reports go home, advisers make phone calls 
or write texts to communicate with families. Advisers sent home appointment letters for Family Conferences and 
make calls to confirm appointments. The Parent Coordinator answers the school phone personally giving her 
immediate contact with parents who call the school. She continuously asks parents if they know what is going on in 
the school, from Family Conferences to other school events. The Parent Coordinator makes personal contact with 
families she knows to be interested in workshop topics with the help of the School Social Worker. The Assistant 
Principal has the numbers of families in his cell phone and regularly calls families to support McKinney-Vento families 
with resources, from supporting parents with their child to informing parents about issues that are occurring within 
the school about their child. The School Social Worker also regularly speaks to parents about confidential issues and 
concerns. Parents have the cell phone numbers of their Adviser, the Parent Coordinator and, depending on the 
situation, the Assistant Principal and the School Social Worker.  

We actively use data to ensure that families who speak Spanish are paired with an adviser who also speaks Spanish. If 
that is not possible, bilingual staff support with family contact. Since the Adviser has all the report card information 
for their advisee, parents can speak to one person about a range of academic information and social-emotional 
concerns. Multiple staff members are bilingual Spanish speakers and regularly translate documents sent home. If 
translation of the document is not possible, the adviser translates the information in a conference with the parent. 
Our robo-call system for events and for attendance is also bilingual. Workshops and meetings for families are 
translated. Some workshops have an English session and then a Spanish session. Our Parent Coordinator who is 
bilingual answers our phones and greets our families when they walk in. Families are always attended to in their 
language of choice by the many staff members who are bilingual. Through continuous parent contact, the Parent 
Coordinator and Advisers are polling families about how best to reach them. The Parent Coordinator and Parent 
Involvement Coordinator regularly meet to assess the impact of their programs on Parent Involvement.  

Regarding student well-being and Family-School Ties, three initiatives had been started in the previous year and 
would continue. The school implemented a dress code policy. This policy came from parents involved in the PA as well 
as parents surveyed by the Assistant Principal. Parents said they could not afford designer clothes and wanted a 
“uniform”. The Assistant Principal was designated to support families and was accountable with the help of the 
teachers for successful implementation. The Principal also made an attendance push in the prior year through the 
positive recognition of parents whose children had 95-100% attendance. The school would continue to inform parents 
of the importance of attendance and track attendance to give recognition to the parents as well as support to those 
students below 95% attendance three times a year. The result of both plans has been strong success. Students have 
responded positively to the dress code and perhaps even because of it, have moved from an average of 91% to 95% 
attendance thus far. These changes were directly connected to students being able to “Work Effectively.” 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          15 

 

 

Trust – The basis of trust is building relationships. At FLHMS, building relationship underpins all of our structures. 
Teachers are grouped in teams to build professional learning communities around common practices or common 
students. Teachers become Advisers to build bridges of communication with families around the progress of students. 
Students move throughout the day with one class to build bonds of community with one another. These relationships 
are the bedrock of the work of FLHMS. We want to use the Renewal School process to enhance these relationships. 
Having staff to do further outreach with parents, to support students with mental health, to provide added staff for 
small group contact – all can enrich the relationships of our community and help us all grow.

Feedback from the spring 2018 Quality Review and PPO noted the following: 

Strengths: 

  The school leader has established a transparent process in place to develop, purposefully evaluate, and adjust 
curricular and instructional practices. The use of the Google’s GSuite for Education continues to allow teachers 
to share resources across the school easily and the use of templates designed to reflect best planning practices 
which are shared and used by all staff. (PPO) 

  The school leader has established clear expectations for teachers to develop units and lesson plans that are 

aligned to the CCLS. (QR) 

  The school uses data-driven instruction, differentiation of instruction, and higher order questioning to support 

student success. (QR) 

Needs: 

  The school leader and teachers need to strengthen their models of co-teaching to more effectively meet the 

needs of students. (QR)

  Teachers need to plan more intentionally in differentiating for ELLs and SWDs. They should consider student 
choice and projects that allow students to access curriculum at their level while getting them to master and 
understand the standards. (PPO) 

  Teachers need to regularly provide data-driven feedback to students in order to facilitate student ownership in 

monitoring their own progress towards their goals. (PPO) 

  Math proficiency increased 1% from 3.5% in 2017 to 4.5% in 2018 on the NYS math exam. Though a small 

increase, it represents a positive shift, given the previous 3-year downward trend. 

  No students with disabilities (SWDs) or English Language Learners (ELLs) were proficient in 2017 or 2018. In 

2018, 92% of SWDs tested at a level 1, and 8% at level 2. Similarly, in 2018, 88% of ELLs tested at level 1 and 12 
% at level 2. Given that none of these students met proficiency, our focus will be on building teacher capacity to 
better meet the needs of these students.  

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction 

What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across 
classrooms?   
At FLHMS we aim to equip students with the skills necessary to advocate for themselves, others, and their world 
through critical thinking, effective work habits, and compassionate actions. Our beliefs about how students learn best is 
reflected in our instructional focus: reading, speaking, and writing about diverse texts and engaging explorations in 
every class, every day, accessible to all students. Our instructional focus is designed to ensure that every class is based 
on "reading, speaking and writing" about text every day regardless of content area. These skills are embedded in each 
curriculum map and each lesson plan template to ensure adherence.  

Our vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across classrooms is evident through the following: 

  Building the instructional focus into the classroom environment expectations keeps it alive and visible every 
day. Since the instructional focus succinctly describes and includes many elements of instruction that make it 
engaging, challenging, and accessible for students, keeping it alive keeps a focus on deepening our commitment 
to how students learn best. 

 

Instructional Leadership Team meetings (including composition of the team), distributive leadership structures 
(role of teacher leaders, teaming structures, running agendas, resources on google drive, daily staff notes, 
transparency in why we do what we do and how we do it provide continual emphasis and feedback on how 
we’re doing. 

  Mentors serve as “torchbearers” for our culture and sharing the instructional vision from a different 

perspective. 

  Grade team/Vertical Team leaders/reps that help support vision of school by relaying ideas to teachers, 

providing exemplars, and learning together to support the development of the vision in classrooms across the 
school. 

 

ILT, admin, and coaches do walkthroughs and have created a tool to provide consistent feedback to teachers 
aligned to the vision and instructional focus. 

 

 

What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners, 
personally, academically, and culturally?  
Our beliefs about how students learn best is reflected in our instructional focus: reading, speaking, and writing about 
diverse texts and engaging explorations in every class, every day, accessible to all students. In order to make our 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          20 

 

curricula accessible to every learner, math teachers, for example, have worked to make their curricula more oriented to 
the middle school learner. All units include an essential or debatable question such as "Is Pluto a planet?" or "Can our 
hair really grow as long as Rapunzel's?" The units are designed for the question to drive student interest in learning the 
foundational skills needed to answer them. In addition, each teacher will embed reciprocal strategies with collaborative 
learning to support ELLs and SWDs in reading, speaking, and writing and to develop their cognitive abilities in thinking 
(e.g. as a scientist or mathematician).  

We have revised our curricula and unit plans for students to be able to access both mirror and window texts, and to 
focus on authentic learning to increase connections to the real world. We are using Culturally Relevant Teaching and the 
Brain as our anchor text and will continue to reflect and revise our curricula and instruction to ensure that it aligns with 
the latest research and reflects and honors our students’ rich cultural heritage. 

 

 

What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be 
career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision? 
At FLHMS, our mission is to equip students with the skills necessary to advocate for themselves, others, and their world 
through critical thinking, effective work habits, and compassionate actions. We believe that these three elements -- 
thinking critically, working effectively, and acting compassionately -- comprise the most important aspects of what 
students will need to be successful in the years to come both in their own lives and in catalyzing positive change for 
others and the world. 

Our curriculum focuses on helping our students develop grade-level mastery of numeracy and literacy skills required to 
meet NY state standards and express their knowledge and ideas clearly and persuasively to many different types of 
audiences. We stress critical thinking and problem solving skills across the curriculum and challenge teachers to imbue 
the critical learning pathways that they develop for our learners with interesting, authentic, and socially relevant tasks, 
texts, and problems. Through the curriculum and our school culture, we strive to model for students what acting 
responsibly and compassionately looks like in a caring, supportive community. In order to be promoted to the following 
grade, and ultimately, graduate from eighth grade, students demonstrate their achievement of the school mission 
through their progress in class (tied to Common Core Learning Standards) and their curated portfolio.  

In math, to improve in the areas of deep understanding and application teachers focus on creating engaging 
explorations that allow for student choice and real-world connection. We have also adopted resources from Illustrative 
Math to help us implement the 5 practices for orchestrating mathematical discussions to help with the balance between 
practice and understanding (dual intensity). By attending to these shifts in addition to a focus on standards-mastery of 
CCLS, the school monitors students for career and college readiness across the content areas. 

Each curriculum map is driven by an essential or debatable question to allow students to go deeper into a topic and to 
make connections among concepts in order to problem-solve. Students will also be assessed based on Standards 
Mastery and teachers will use i-Ready data to create instructional groupings to move students to mastery. By 
programming classes to support differentiated groups as well as providing a standards-based assessment system, 
students will be supported and monitored based on the progressions outlined in the Common Core Standards aligned to 
both the Math Practices and the Math Concepts. 

 

 

What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?  
Our instructional focus: reading, speaking, and writing about diverse texts and engaging explorations in every class, 
every day, accessible to all students. is designed to ensure that every class is based on reading, speaking and writing 
about math every day. These skills are embedded in each curriculum map and each lesson plan template to ensure 
coherence. In order to ensure these expectations are being met, the principal and coaches will monitor teacher unit 
plans and lesson plans as outlined in Goal 2. There will be walkthroughs arranged with feedback provided based on the 
criteria outlined in the summary above. Grade Teams and Vertical Teams will use the i-Ready data to monitor student 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          21 

 

success. In the Extended Learning Time period, small group instruction will be based on Standards Mastery Data and will 
be provided to students who need more support. 

 

 

How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child? 
In addition to the Instructional Focus, teachers are exposed to other forms of entry points from on-site consultants as 
well as sharing best practices through team planning and lesson study. We will use the team planning and lesson study 
to examine ways that the math team can best support access for all students. By pulling from task-based curriculum to 
ensure that the focus is on problem solving strategies as opposed to only "following the steps," we believe students will 
be able to access problems using the knowledge they bring to the classroom already. The "Five Practices for 
Mathematical Discourse" instructional routine will be a focus for the math team to ensure that students are allowed 
time to problem solve rich tasks and support learning through discussion with peers and adults in the room. Finally, 
teachers will devise scaffolds to support the needs of specific learners so that all students can access rigorous tasks.  

 

 

What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and 
summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes? 
The school will use an assessment vision based on i-Ready, the DRP, and the Ready Book assessments. This data will 
drive curriculum mapping, daily instruction, strategic grouping as well as intervention groups in ELT. In addition, for 
more frequent formative assessments, teachers will use the assessments created and shared by the Bronx Field Support 
Center.

We will use the advisory system to maintain consistent contact with home about the CCLS students are focusing on 
and their progress toward achieving them. By using a standards-based grading system, all progress reports and grades 
are reported vis-a-vis the CCLS for each subject area. Through student-led conferences, students will explain to their 
families how their work connects to standards and their progress toward achieving them in each class. In conjunction

Strengths: 

Principal Wilson engages in ongoing goal setting and makes revisions as evidenced in the monthly charts in her room. 
These include interventions, targets, shifts, etc. Principal Wilson continues to lead faculty in developing a short list of 
clear, focused school-level goals and action plans (long-term, annual, and interim) apparent in Renewal Reports team 
planning documents as evidenced in her office. The goals are tracked in the data tool and she continues to successfully 
check for progress. Subsequently she makes adjustments to drive efforts to accelerate student learning and foster 
social-emotional growth. (PPO 3.1) 

Principal Wilson and her leadership teams (School Leadership Team, Instructional Leadership Team, and 
Guidance/Attendance Leadership Team) utilize various data sources, such as Success Highway, New Visions Student 
Sorter and Heat Map, i-Ready, Ready Book, and DRP, to surface trends and devise action plans to address gaps in 
student performance. Based on the leadership team and the teacher teams’ analyses, the school has identified student 
resiliency and motivation as an area of focus. To that end, teacher teams are currently working on modifying existing 
Expeditionary Learning units and developing more rigorous and meaningful tasks to engage students and interventions 
to remediate the gaps. (PPO 3.1) 

Areas for Growth 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          28 

 

Chronic Absenteeism: We continue to experience a high percentage of students (greater than 20% each year) who have 
a history of being chronically absent. Through our CBO Partnership with Children, we have partnered with Phipps to 
support with ELT and after school programming. The additional advisors provide more targeted support, including acting 
as Success Mentors to some of our chronic absentee students.  

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment 

What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you in partnership with each CBO and families 
enact your vision? 
Stakeholders (parents, teachers, students, and staff) already describe the school as a safe community of learner, a 
community that creates trusting relationships. As part of understanding the FLHMS student population, FLHMS 
partnered with Turnaround for Children for six years to develop an understanding of how to support school reform in 
low income neighborhoods. Creating a safe environment with trusting relationships are some of the ways that at-risk 
students can feel nurtured enough to learn in spite of their environmental conditions. In addition to Cooperative 
Learning Structures and Learning Targets (both are supports for at-risk learners), the school has other elements 
embedded to nurture our students. The school is structured deliberately to enhance community and collaboration. For 
example, students travel together with the same class all year to create a small community of learners. In each class, 
students are deliberately grouped with high, middle and low students for differentiated groups - or with same level 
group for interventions. All classes do team builders for small groups and class builders for full groups. Once a day, 15-17 
students are paired with one adult during Advisory time. That adult is the bridge between home and school for Family 
Conferences, phone calls home and all other parent communication. Advisory groups do team builders as well. All self-
contained students are mainstreamed into Advisory. Advisory is a time for goal setting around monthly progress reports 
as well as homework help using on-line programs. Workshops on high school, college and career as well as conflict 
resolution, Internet safety and health education are scheduled either during Advisory or class time. These activities are 
directly related to our Mission of students “Acting Compassionately.”  

This SEL framework for FLHMS is enhanced by our CBO partner, Partnership with Children (PwC). PWC has partnered 
with Astor Services for Families and Children to provide an on-site mental health clinic. A Social Worker is in the building 
5 days a week working with both middle school clients and elementary school clients who would eventually graduate to 
the middle school. This Tier 3 intervention provides much needed outside counseling to students who face extreme 
forms of trauma in addition to adolescence. Partnership with Children's (PwC) model enables us to provide more robust 
support with both Tier 2 and Tier 1 interventions across the school. PwC has formed student leadership groups for 
students who need a sense of ownership of the school culture. These groups include: Peer Mediation, Student 
Ambassadors, School Store, and Lunch and Recess Committee. Each group of students meets once a week with the PwC 
social worker to create and implement goals aligned to their committee. PwC also will be working with teachers to 
create a welcoming environment in their classrooms that will help students want to come to school.  

Attendance Interventions are tracked in the New Visions Portal as well as the Heat Map. The Attendance Team reviews 
student progress and referrals each week and determines the effectiveness of current interventions, as well as the need 
for additional supports, including referrals to the guidance team. In addition, the team organizes attendance incentives 
and plans celebrations to recognize milestones.  

Teacher teams use the New Visions Portal to identify students needing targeted attendance interventions in addition to 
interventions to help them address academic and behavioral-emotional concerns. Such interventions might include 
tutoring sessions and ELT targeted groups, at-risk counseling or anger management group. Students needing more 
support are brought to the Student Intervention Team, where teacher teams work with the school social worker to 
identify resources both inside and outside the school building to provide the needed supports. Grade teams meet to 
develop consistent policies regarding academic responsibilities and behaviors in an intervention plan. The Team looks 
closely at the students' needs to identify resources both inside and outside the school building to provide the needed 
supports, such as individual therapy through Astor Services for Family and Children, peer mediation run by Partnership 
with Children or development of behavior intervention plans with case management organized by the school's Student 
Intervention Team (SIT).  

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          29 

 

Grade teams share responsibility for three to four classes of 90-95 students. These smaller learning communities help 
teachers build strong relationships with students and personalize the school environment. The school schedule 
facilitates collaboration. Teacher teams to meet for common planning time weekly to examine student data in 
attendance, behavior, and academic performance, and to determine how to help students who are having difficulties 
academically or personally.  

FLHMS staff will continue to promote a school climate that places a high value on students’ talents and ability to learn, 
academic achievement, and strong relationships among students, adults, and staff. FLHMS will continue to cultivate 
student voice through its curriculum which promotes student discussion using critical thinking skills. SEL student voices 
will continue to be developed as well through the PwC student leadership committees as well as through CAS student 
leadership programs.  

Our distributed leadership model and teacher team organization empowers teachers to take charge of creating a safe 
environment that promotes high-quality teaching and learning. The use of cooperative learning strategies in the 
classroom encourages students to build relationships and social and leadership skills that foster a sense of responsibility 
and ownership for a positive school climate.

Part 3 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools – Supportive Environment. Your goal must be consistent with the 
expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART – 
Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact 
meeting at least one of your Renewal Benchmarks and/or Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks. 
Supportive Environment - By June 2019, we will personalize attendance supports for students who are chronically 
absent (< 90%), resulting in a 2% reduction in the percentage of returning students who were chronically absent 
during the 2017-18 school year, as well as for incoming sixth graders whose fifth grade attendance was less than 90%.

4b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
We engage families through events, workshops, and outreach. The advisory system facilitates open communication 
between families and the school. Advisers serves as the primary contact home, sharing both good news as well as the 
struggles. Through student-led conferences, students will explain to their families how their work connects to 
standards and their progress toward achieving them in each class. In conjunction with our CBO, Partnership with 
Children, we will host at least 4 Academic Parent Teacher Team (APTT) learning sessions that parents are equipped 
with the information and resources to best support their students. We will also host Roundtables at least once this 
year for students to present their work to families and community members.

Strengths 

Our School Survey data reveal that teachers continue to want to grow professionally and have had meaningful 
professional learning opportunities. Some examples include:  

60% of teachers say that they had opportunities to work productively with teachers from other schools on professional 
development. This was an increase from 48% in 2016-17 

78% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that overall, their professional development experiences this year have 
included opportunities to work productively with colleagues in their school. This was an 8% increase from 2016-17. 

76% of teachers say that teachers take responsibility for improving the school. This was an increase of 2% from 2016-17. 

92% of teachers say that teachers are actively trying to improve their teaching. This was an increase of 5% from 2016-
17.

While we have worked to put structures in place to support teacher learning and development, teacher capacity 
remains an area of focus. This was seen in the student performance data (referenced in Rigorous Instruction), the 
Survey data, as well as in the PPO and QR, both of which noted that 1.2 needs greater attention.  

The Spring 2018 PPO noted, "There is more evidence of the footprints of Principal leading the work so that “this is how 
we do it” is more evident. We observed students using interactive notebooks and taking apart short answers. Principal 
Wilson has provided professional development in lesson planning and lesson structure. She introduced the GANAG 
method to enable teachers to plan for high-yield instructional strategies that will lead to increased results. She also 
created a resource guide to aid teachers in planning each section of the lesson. They have also discussed the structure 
during the lesson. This structure was more evident in the ELA and Social Studies classrooms. Students can speak about 
strategies for ELA but not as freely for math. However, in some classrooms, teaching strategies (including questioning, 
scaffolds in English and/or native language where appropriate, and routines) inconsistently provide multiple entry points 
into the curricula leading to uneven engagement in appropriately challenging tasks and uneven demonstration of 
higher-order thinking skills in student work products, including the work of ELLs and SWDs. There is still a need for more 
focused scaffolds for ELLs." 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers 

What is your vision for collaborative teaching?   

The principal works with the School Leadership Team (SLT) and Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) to organize 
scheduled time for grade teams to meet twice a week and for vertical teams to meet once a week. In addition, weekly 
professional development time is usually organized so vertical teams can meet on common pedagogical topics to ensure 
coherent implementation across the school. Grade teams address the needs of the students in their grade. Discrete 
planning times are arranged for grade teams twice a week to develop “community” and to target support for learners in 
groups and individually. Vertical teams are also assigned weekly meeting time to develop curriculum aligned to the 
Common Core Standards. To support each group, additional professional development time is organized by the principal 
and professional development coordinator. This time is allocated to address specific needs, such as developing a data-
driven Professional Learning Community. As a result of the PLC work, each vertical team devised standards-based goals 
for every learner aligned to their performance on a benchmark assessment. The vertical team actively monitors student 
data and student work to adjust the implementation of their curricula and to meet larger school achievement goals.  

Teachers use the workshop model in their teaching. During the "we do" portion of the lesson, teachers use Cooperative 
Learning Structures to stimulate communication between students. Teachers pose an open-ended question for students 
to consider and share their answers with classmates. Questions are based on CCLS as well as grade level texts with 
scaffolds to allow multiple entry points for different learners. The units are broken up to be “foundational” where 
students are exposed to new concepts and skills, then students need to show their ability to use these new concepts 
and skills in a summative assessment that is redrafted with deeper critical thinking into a portfolio piece. Each 
summative assessment is designed to be challenging and allow students to show off their mastery in the discipline. As 
students work on their summative assessments, teachers build in Cooperative Learning Structures around open-ended 
questions devised by the students to deepen their understanding of the work through conversation. In order to 
differentiate effectively, teachers meet with co-teachers (ICT) weekly in order to target specific student groups such as 
IEP students and ELL’s. Teachers use different modalities in order to engage students with different needs and learning 
styles. For example, ELLs and IEP students will also be provided with an audio version of the text. Content areas also 
provide translated versions of texts to align instruction to ELL’s in order to provide them with an entry point into the 
material. Teachers respond to benchmark assessment data and modify instruction as necessary. Teachers provide work 
that is aligned to that student’s level of mastery (Mastery, Near Mastery, Remediation) as evidenced by the most recent 
benchmark. For learners at Mastery, the task is not modified. Mastery students may receive different tasks or texts to

How do you envision collaboration amongst your School Instructional Cabinet to improve teacher practices and 
student learning? 
Collaboration is central to teaching practice. The ILT (instructional cabinet) reviews data from student assessments, 
Advance, and from intervisitations and walkthroughs with staff to monitor teacher practice in alignment to the RSCEP 
goals, instructional focus, and school mission. Using this data, the ILT designs professional learning for teachers (both 
whole-staff and tiered), ensures that coaching and mentoring support is distributed appropriately, and sets agendas for 
the grade and vertical teams (led by members of the SLT and ILT). Through this teaming structure, the school is able to 
leverage distributed leadership and collaboration to build and develop common practices across the school in response 
to student achievement data.  

 

 

How do you envision collaboration within teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?  
Each team has a PLC protocol (based in both lesson study and consultancy) to ensure that teams are basing their 
practice on research-based and data-driven team work. Teams use a running agenda to capture learning and next steps. 
Departmental teams engage in cycles of inquiry around a common problem of practice (monitored for alignment by the 
Instructional Leadership Team) in which teachers present their lessons and resulting student work.  

 

 

How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?  
The Study Group model where teachers in different grades and different subjects meet, has provided much "cross-
pollination" of best practices across the school. Teams meet around a focus area that aligns with the school's 
instructional focus. For example, to support student literacy, the math and science teams engaged in a learning cycle 
focused on infusing The Writing Revolution's writing strategies into their curricula.  

 
What data will teachers and the School Instructional Cabinet regularly review to ensure that they are reflecting upon 
their teaching practices and meeting individual student learning needs?  What is the intent for reviewing each piece of 
data? (ex. Teachers will regularly review student IEPs when developing lessons in order to ensure that tasks are 
appropriately scaffolded.)

4b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
We engage families through events, workshops, and outreach. The advisory system facilitates open communication 
between families and the school. Advisers serves as the primary contact home, sharing both good news as well as the 
struggles. Through student-led conferences, students will explain to their families how their work connects to 
standards and their progress toward achieving them in each class. In conjunction with our CBO, Partnership with 
Children, we will host at least 4 Academic Parent Teacher Team (APTT) learning sessions that parents are equipped 
with the information and resources to best support their students. These sessions promote teacher-parent/family 
collaboration, and serve as another example of the collaborative nature of our school/ We will also host Roundtables 
at least once this year for students to present their work to families and community members.

Strengths: 

Data from the School Survey in the Effective School Leadership domain, as well as the PPO highlight strengths.. All of the 
measures that comprise the Effective School Leadership domain increased from 2016-17. The largest growth was seen in 
"Program Coherence" (76% to 88% positive) and "Teacher Influence" (79% to 86% positive). 

The spring 2018 PPO identified 5.1 as a strength, "Principal Wilson and faculty reflected on previous feedback and 
continues to build on the existing processes to regularly evaluate and adjust curricular and instructional practices in 
response to student learning needs and the expectations of the CCLS (evaluation of practices of 1.1, 1.2, 2.2). She has 
monitored the use of organizational resources, the effectiveness of teacher team work, and professional development 
practices, with particular attention to what teachers need to learn to support student mastery of the CCLS (evaluation of 
practices of 1.3, 4.1, 4.2). Principal Wilson stated, “We have not sat on what is not working. We have made immediate 
changes when something doesn’t work.” In both ELA and math Principal Wilson has made class shifts, schedule shifts, 
curricular shifts, and instructional shifts. This has led to an increase in mastery of standards covered as evidenced in the 
results from the administration of formative assessments. She has made shifts and changes that have resulted in growth 
in the student results on interim assessments in places that she has focused on and given priority. Considering that 
73/97 students were level 1. She was able to assess the student sorter to immediately share current student data and 
point out to the growth and predicted achievement."

Areas of Focus 

Last year 50% of the staff were new to the profession, as a result, teacher practice was and remains an area of focus. In 
particular, our MOTP data revealed the following: 1e - 2.82; 2a - 2.37, 2d - 2.96 3b - 2.78, 3c - 2.19, 3d - 2.29, 4e - 2.35. 
The element with the greatest number of teachers at the developing and/or ineffective level is 3c. 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Effective School Leadership 

What is your vision for effective school leadership at your school? 

The implementation of Instructional Focus and Danielson Framework component 3C (Engaging Students in Learning) will 
be the academic leverage point for all professional learning activities for the year. The Principal, Instructional Leadership 
Team (ILT) and the Community School Director (CSD) will collaborate to ensure that school and CBO resources are 
aligned to its implementation across the school. After gathering data on teacher curriculum and pedagogy from 
formative, informal, and formal observations, in addition to student feedback and staff feedback from surveys, the 
Principal, in conjunction with the ILT and CSD, will develop targeted professional learning cycles and sessions responsive 
to the needs surfaced in the staff and student data. Teacher leaders (formal as well as vertical team leaders), the 
instructional coach, and coaches from the FSC and partner CBOs will provide individual coaching aligned to targeted 
professional learning intended to support the instructional focus in classrooms and increase student engagement. The 
Principal and Assistant Principal will monitor the implementation of pedagogical practices related to the Instructional 
Focus through frequent formal and informal observations with specific and targeted feedback related to the 
Instructional Focus and increasing effectiveness in Danielson 3C. The Principal, CSD, ILT, and other key stakeholders will 
do monthly walkthroughs to monitor the full-school implementation of the Instructional Focus and to assess next steps 
for professional development across the school.  

Effective teachers will: 

● share student or teacher models to make examples of high quality work clear to students, 

● use questioning techniques that invite student thinking and student discussion around a topic, 

● elicit and assess student understanding using questioning techniques and engaging tasks  

● provide timely feedback and guidance to advance student learning across the classroom 

● organize students in data-driven groupings to maximize learning 

● provide resources and materials that are text-based and can engage all learners 

 

In the effective classroom, we would hear or see oral or written evidence such as:  

● Students explaining their learning orally or in writing 

● Students using tasks and answering open-ended questions to discuss text with one another 

● Students using text to make evidence based claims 

● Students constructing and justifying their argument using text-based evidence 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

● All students involved in discussions – with scaffolds if needed 

As part of the implementation of the Instructional Focus, the CBO partner will support FLHMS in developing data-driven 
systems to assess student progress and performance on the social-emotional supports and impediments to student 
success. The social-emotional framework will be implemented on a Tier 1 (school-wide), Tier 2 (small group) and Tier 3 
(individual) level with the support of in-school social workers and our CBO, Partnership with Children. We will use the 
New Visions Heat Map in addition to our academic tracker, Mastery Connect, to build capacity in teachers to respond to 
a variety of student needs and develop targeted plans for students who need them. 

This vision will be tracked through the RSCEP goals, and a body of stakeholders (SLT, ILT, CBO, parents, students and 
staff) will continue to monitor and revise RSCEP goals throughout the year using the data collected. Based on the data, 
the Principal and the SLT will work with the CBO partners to ensure the Instructional Focus is being implemented with 
social-emotional supports in place. The Principal will also regularly meet (at least once a week) with the Community 
School Director to ensure that the action plan related to each CEP goal is being implemented. The principal, assistant 
principal and all consultants / would meet to ensure that the APPR goals of each teacher are being met, and also meet 
with each grade team and each teacher periodically (after each Report Card) to go over the academic progress of 
students in the school and compare student progress to school goals.  

 

 
 

On which aspects of your own leadership do you plan to focus for the upcoming school year? 
Building leadership capacity among effective and highly effective teaching staff so that they can support the building 
and sustaining of a school culture and environment that includes teachers being both academically demanding, using a 
coherent set of strategies to engage, push, and respond to student needs, and be personally supportive of students.  

 

 

What is your vision for ensuring that everyone in your schools has a normed and shared understanding of the school’s 
vision, mission, and instructional focus?  
The staff will engage in developing a normed understanding through activities designed throughout the year in 
professional learning time, beginning with our Staff Summer Institute in August. Our shared understandings are then 
developed and implemented at staff professional learning and monitored by the SLT and ILT using data from 
observations, walkthroughs, and student/staff surveys. All instructional coaches and staff use a common walkthrough 
tool aligned to Danielson and the instructional focus to provide coordinated feedback from coaches (as well as peer-to-
peer). Common meeting protocols are used across the school to ensure that team inquiry remains aligned to the 
instructional focus as well as focus on how students learn best as described in the Danielson Framework (with a focus 
on 3C). 

 

 
 

What is your vision for developing differentiated leadership throughout your school? How will you utilize teacher 
leaders to build broad capacity within your school?  
Leadership is developed throughout the school on the teams listed above as leaders are drawn from multiple 
constituents. ILT is made of up teacher leaders from each vertical team (science, SS, math, and ELA) as well as the ENL 
team and Special Education team. SLT has representatives from each grade team, as well as parents, and our CBO 
partners attend each month. 

By creating an out-of-classroom instructional coach position, we are able to provide a mentor to new and newer 
teachers as well as have someone support literacy-based teams to carry out the school's instructional focus across 
classrooms. This teacher is trained by the New Teacher Center (to build capacity to support new teachers) and by MSQI 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

(Middle School Quality Initiative) to focus on teacher development in literacy curriculum and instruction across the 
content areas.  

We also invest in the teacher leadership pathways initiative and have staffed one peer collaborative teacher (PCT) and 
two model teachers. These teacher participate in two communities of practice - one to build capacity in school 
leadership with other teacher leaders from schools around the district and another to build capacity for leadership in 
their content area. These teachers then turnkey these experiences to teams that are on in the school as well as leading 
learning to the whole staff during professional learning time. They will also develop "lab classrooms" where to both 
showcase effective practices and try out promising practices for others in the school to see. 

 

 

How will the leader foster collaborative school governance processes, and ensure full family participation together 
with other stakeholders? 
School decisions are made collaboratively with two leadership bodies. The School Leadership Team (SLT) is made up of 
the principal, parents, CBO partners, teachers (grade team leaders) and part of the guidance staff. This team monitors 
our progress toward our RSCEP goals and we decide next steps to take if we need to make adjustments. We ensure 
ensure staff, students, and families are able to access programs and initiatives at the school as well. This body meets 
monthly. 

The Instructional Leadership Team is made up of our vertical team leaders, including representatives from Special 
Education and ENL. This team also has our Community School Director on it to ensure all partnering programs are 
aligned. This team creates action plans, monitors initiatives and makes decisions about staff professional learning to 
support the RSCEP goals. The team also creates implementation plans around feedback from the SLT to ensure that 
families are up-to-date and involved in their student's education (e.g., implementing workshops requested by the PA at 
SLT).  

Finally, the principal meets with a Guidance/Attendance leadership team to ensure that student social-emotional 
support action plans are developed and are responsive to student needs. Guidance leaders on this team also attend SLT 
and ILT to ensure coherence and alignment to goals.  

Together, these teams craft and monitor school goals and action plans to ensure that the school is on-track to meet our 
goals.

Student and teacher programs are organized to provide support to students based on data from NYS ELA and 
mathematics assessments, NYSESLAT results, and school-level benchmark and interim assessments. Students are 
programmed both into classes to support their specific mandated needs (e.g., ELL learners and SWD) and programmed 
into additional support classes or flexible groups based on student data that is monitored throughout the year. 

We will use our budget to bring in more resources for ELLs, SWD's and AIS students as well as use the budget to provide 
enrichment activities for all learners. This includes, but is not limited to, enrichment opportunities that increase student

Part 3 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools – Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be consistent with the 
expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART – 
Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact 
meeting at least one of your Renewal Benchmarks and/or Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks. 
Effective School Leadership: By June 2019, the school leadership team will provide clear, strategic, and actionable 
feedback in observations that will result in 10% of teachers increasing one level of effectiveness (e.g., ineffective to 
developing, developing to effective, or effective to highly effective) in Engaging Students in Learning (3C) on Danielson's 
Framework for Teaching.

4b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How  will  your  school  engage  parents/families  and  support  their  understanding  of  Effective  School  Leadership  and 
strategies  to  promote  parent  leadership  and  engagement  in  order  to  support  their  children  at  home?  Include  the 
timeline and identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
We engage families through events, workshops, and outreach. Parent members of the SLT help to monitor our 
progress towards this goal looking at school-level data summaries to see that we're on track and providing 
suggestions for ways to support student engagement in the classroom. Through student-led conferences, students 
will explain to their families how their work connects to standards and their progress toward achieving them in each 
class. The SLT and Parent Association will work to bring families in to encourage student engagement in summative 
projects (Roundtables) by making the audience more than the teacher. n conjunction with our CBO, Partnership with 
Children, we will host at least 4 Academic Parent Teacher Team (APTT) learning sessions as well as College Access for 
All workshops so that parents are equipped with the information and resources to best support their students and 
help them understand what they can do with the knowledge they're developing.

Part 2 – Summative Vision for Strong Family and Community Ties 

What is your vision for having strong family and community ties at your school? 

As part of welcoming the families to Fannie Lou Hamer Middle School, the school with the support of our CBO partner, 
Partnership with Children, holds an Open House for 6th graders in August and, in early September, for the whole school 
to share the Instructional Focus and priorities for the year. Over the summer, our CBO partner and school staff would 
reach out to families - returning and new - about the Instructional Focus and school goals for the upcoming year. This 
also works to build a personal connection with families prior to the start of the year. Our parent coordinator, in 
conjunction with our CBO, will reach out to families to ensure both through telephone and mail, to inform them of 
events in the fall as well as explain our focus on both outreach and increasing parent involvement in school activities.  

All school staff work to build a positive atmosphere. FLHMS personally answers all phones. Our Parent Coordinator is 
bilingual so families can get questions answered in their home language. Fannie Lou Hamer Middle School has worked 
hard to build a climate of trust with parents and community members, and it will continue to build on this strength as it 
moves into its school transformation plan. In addition to the Parent Coordinator, each student is paired with a teacher 
who acts as an “adviser”. The adviser is the bridge between home and school for academic and behavioral updates, and 
makes phone calls home regarding any student issues. The adviser also supports each family in understanding the 
Instructional Focus through discussions of student progress reports and report cards during Family Conferences. Each 
adviser takes 20-30 minutes to go over all aspects of a student’s progress with the family in their preferred language.  

To increase awareness of family questions and concerns, during the planning process Partnership with Children (PwC) 
will help the school make connections with parents as well as agencies that can support student success, and help 
determine an effective communication plan that reaches a variety of stakeholders. PwC staff meet with families and 
school and district community members to outline the components of the model, explain how they benefit students and 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

their families, discuss opportunities for families and the community to become involved with the school’s 
implementation efforts, and answer questions and concerns regarding implementation of the model.  

PwC will help the school share its Instructional Focus throughout the school year in Open Houses, newsletters, and 
workshops. PwC, the Community School Team, and Parent Association will work to plan events that respond to parent 
needs as gathered through surveys. They will support the implementation of both events aligned to supporting our 
instructional focus and academic growth goals as well as workshops that build parent capacity for navigating furthering 
education for their child (e.g., Academic Parent Teacher Teams (APTT), College Access for all Workshops, high school 
application process, etc.).  

To close the gap between outreach and involvement, we want to increase the opportunities through maintaining 
outreach for parents to see their child's work products and be a part of the classroom. To do this, we are going to offer 
two Roundtable opportunities for parents to come in to see students present their work to peers and other adults. In 
addition, in conjunction with our CET, PA, and PwC, we are going to focus on celebrating student work and achievement 
at each meeting and event so that more parents come in to other events as well. 

 

 

Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the school 
community?  What support will administrators, teachers, school staff and school safety officers be given to help create 
a welcoming environment?   Will there be a dedicated space for families in the school? 
 
In addition to traditional school-family events (workshops, meetings, conferences), the Community School model will 
also provide access to school-based health clinic and mental health clinic services. In addition, we have a Community 
School team that has monthly meetings to build the vision for everything our school can offer and develop action plans 
to create these in the school. The team is made up of a variety of individuals, including teachers and administrators so 
that all voices come together to build, plan and implement the vision. In the school, we share a parent room with CS 66 
and we have space in the front office for all parent information as well as a bulletin board at the entrance dedicated to 
families. We regularly coordinate with all of our staff, including school safety officers, to ensure families have access to 
people who can communicate in their language (or access the call center) and so everyone has up-to-date information 
on family events. 

 

 

 How will the school identify and develop families to take leadership roles in school decision making/school 
governance structures? 
Partnership with Children will work with parent leaders to participate in the PA, Community School Forums, APTT 
program and SLT. Our CBO in conjunction with our parent coordinator (PC) and with support from FACE, we will support 
parents to develop capacity in leadership roles as they serve on the SLT, CST, and PA. We will also engage parents to run 
school events along with the PwC and school staff in order to build parent leadership and ownership in the school.  

 

 
 

How will the school engage the community and families? How will they ensure that teachers are able to learn from 
families about the children being taught? 
The school is initiating a modified APTT protocol in all workshops that will support parents in becoming their own child's 
teacher, which will enable educators and parents to act as partners on behalf of students and build parent and family 
connections to the school's academic goals. Each student has an adviser which provides a direct connection and contact 
to the school and families and advisers speak around 1x per month on average. We invite families in for various events, 
and teachers as well as parents support in planning, coordinating, and running these events.

Roundtables are held twice a year and are an opportunity 
for families to see students in action, speaking to and 
getting feedback on their work 

How do families partner with the school and CBO to support student success?  Will there be dedicated space for 
families?   
Family partnerships with 
school: 

PWC has supported the active participation of the PA and parent SLTmembers in the 
school community. 

 

Family partnerships with CBO: 

PWC has partnered with the school and Children's Aid to create parent workshops 
based on family interest and has surveyed families regarding their needs. Series of 
workshops as part of the College Access for All initiative. 

Is there dedicated space for 
these partnerships? 

 

Yes. 

 

 

  
 

 

What is your vision for the role the school will take in providing access adult education classes within the community? 

Children's Aid Society and Fannie Lou Hamer Middle School provide ENL, technology, financial literacy and enrichment 
classes to parents. We also leverage partnerships with a local community college that parents to take advantage of. We 
advertise other opportunities through the district, CEC, and local CBOs.  

 

 

What data and student progress feedback loops will be present at the school to ensure that families knowledgeable of 
their children’s scholastic success? 
Advisory system to support parent outreach and teacher-family connections, monthly progress reports, family 
conferences all use standards-based grades to provide data to families on student progress toward grade-level 
standards. I-Ready provides information to families on growth in reading and math, even when current achievement is 
below grade-level.

Section 6: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) Program Description 

 

Directions: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) activities are directly aligned to the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environments, and Strong Family and Community Ties. ELT provides enriching 
educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship-
building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and 
extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring 
that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200 
additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of 
instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in 
grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced 
curriculum that can include ELA, math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections 
on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.  
 
Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s) 

Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Goals for ELT should align to the 
Renewal Benchmarks.  How will the school will ensure that all students’ individual needs are served during the 
Renewal ELT and how the school’s vision for ELT will impact both academic achievement and social emotional 
growth? Be sure to construct the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
The school will build an Extended Learning Academy to serve all 285 students in the school to increase the student 
grade-level performances in ELA and Math with a 10% of students moving up one level on the NYS ELA and Math 
assessments by June 2019.  

 

 
Part 2 – ELT Program Type 

Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory? 

 

Voluntary 

X 

Compulsory 

Renewal ELT – Describe what accountability structures the school will employ to ensure participation of all students, 
including special populations, will participate fully in Renewal ELT. 
Additional ELT - If there is a voluntary ELT program in addition to the compulsory Renewal ELT, indicate how you will 
actively encourage the participation of all students, with the goal of serving at least 50% of students. 
ELT is built into the student school day and communicated to students and families as period 8.  

 

 
Part 3 – ELT Program Description 

Target Population: The ELT program for a Renewal School will be offered to all students in the school. 

Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program: 
How will the school integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make 
learning relevant and engaging?   
How will CBO staff and the school’s teachers be integrated to provide a seamless learning day? 

  Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as 

to promote higher attendance, reduces risk for retention or drop out, and increases the likelihood of 
graduation. 

  Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may 

benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

  What new content areas and opportunities will be offered to students? How will the school ensure all IEP and 

language mandates are met during ELT? 

  Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including 

opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art. 

  Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the 

supervision of a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area. 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

  How will community educators receive professional development?  Are there plans to provide joint PD to 

school faculty and community partner staff? 

  What content will be led by pedagogical staff and what content will be led by CBO partners? 
  How will the school best utilize CBO partners to impact student achievement? 
  How will effective outreach be conducted to families? 
  How will programming be made easily accessible to students and families in order to encourage 

participation? 

Expanded Learning Time - During ELT, both academic and enrichment opportunities will be provided to students in 
order to support student academic achievement, in addition to raising student engagement in order to prepare 
students for college and career readiness across the grades.  

Three days a week, across the grade levels, teachers will leverage high-interest technology-based programs to 
support student academic achievement in reading, writing, and Math. This includes the use of the online myON 
reading platform that provides over 5,500 high-interest, engaging digital books for adolescents in reading levels from 
preK-12, including bilingual Spanish titles, supplemented by stocked and updated classroom libraries. Teachers will 
work with students during this time to build independent reading stamina with scaffolded supports while also 
providing periodic assessment of student reading Lexile level. Through myON, students and teachers can also support 
writing-about-text goals and publish online work to the school community, creating both a personalized online 
literacy environment with opportunities for students to engage academically with one another.  

 

During this time, teachers across grade levels can also provide intervention for SE, AIS, PID, and ELL students through 
tiered intervention services, including small-group literacy instruction using research-based curricula, ENL support for 
ELL's (supported by school-wide access to engaging technology platforms such as i-Ready), and STEM support across 
the grade levels (also supported by school-wide access to engaging technology platforms such as IXL, MobyMax, 
Brainpop, and i-Ready). Teachers will also provide extension opportunities for students through these online 
platforms. 

 
Two days a week teachers and CBO partners (e.g., Children’s Aid Society, Marquis Studios, etc.) will provide high-
interest academic and enrichment activities designed to specifically promote student engagement across the school. 
These activities will include (but are not limited to): 

  Team and individual sports (e.g., wrestling, girls and boys basketball, track, etc.); 
 

Student leadership (e.g., mediation and student government programs) and debate club opportunities 
(supported by MSQI’s city-wide debate program); 
STEM enrichment opportunities (e.g., Girls Who Code, MSQI Science Fair); 

 
  Arts enrichment opportunities (supported by CBO partners); 
 
  Extended academic enrichment in Math and ELA (e.g., literature circles with author visits, book clubs, poetry 

Foreign language enrichment (e.g., Rosetta Stone program); and, 

and literacy magazine programs supported by MSQI, math extension classes, etc.) 

In addition to regular programming, ELT allows for flexible programming to provide special opportunities and 
opportunities for celebrations of student achievements. This includes supporting our advisory program by allowing 
extended trips to places like colleges, Nature’s Classroom (an overnight educational center in Connecticut), and local 
museums and parks. ELT also supports the programming of monthly grade level Town Halls (where students build 
class and team spirit as well as celebrate monthly achievements). Special opportunities that bring the whole school 
together such as the student-planned and led FLHMS Talent Show, Fannie Lou Hamer Day, Black/Women’s History 
month celebrations, guest speakers (e.g., authors and inspirational community leaders), and celebration assemblies 
are planned and implemented during ELT, both increasing student engagement and providing a place for students to 
be leaders. 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

Through our after-school program with Children’s Aid, boys basketball and archery are offered to students. Children’s 
Aid also provides a Student Leadership Program, a Video Program tied to the Tribeca Film Festival, an “Iron Chef’s” 
Program as well as a Summer Camp to augment the FLHMS Summer School. 

 

Because “Acting Compassionately” is so important at FLHMS, we have a Peer Mediation Program that helps students 
solve their conflicts through mediated discussions with the support of Partnership with Children, our Social Worker 
and SW interns. CAS also provides a co-ed counseling program to all at-risk students to talk about their feelings on 
teen-related subjects. CAS and FLHMS worked collaboratively to provide simultaneous Saturday Programming so 
parents could take Financial Literacy, ENL or Zumba classes while students were getting ELA or Math tutoring from 
FLHMS teaching staff. Families also have access to immediate counseling through a school- based Mental Health Clinic 
with a social worker from Astor Services for Children and Families throughout the week. Based on these initiatives as 
well as other school-embedded social-emotional supports, the Learning Environment Survey indicates that FLHMS is a 
community that students, parents and teachers feel is safe and productive.  

 

We will continue to leverage technology throughout the upcoming school year to support student achievement, 
monitor progress, and increase student engagement. In addition to SmartBoard technology that allows teachers 
immediate access to the Internet to provide multiple entry points, student reading and math skills have been 
enhanced and fluency increased using Mimio for Early Reading and Reading Comprehension Programs for ELL’s, i-
Ready, myON, Moby Max and RAZkids for reading comprehension and stamina, Moby Max and IXL for math fluency, 
and i-Ready for critical thinking in Math. Moby Max and Reading A-Z also provide non-fiction texts for use in Science 
and Social Studies as well as audio to support learners in accessing grade level text. All students have a Gmail account, 
and many teachers use Gmail and Google Classroom to assign differentiated assignments to their students. This easy 
access to assignments allows Extended Learning Time teachers to individualize assignments with strategic groups of 
students based on standards mastery. FLHMS has worked with CAS and other CBOs so tutors can continue the work 
with students at their homework help sessions. The school also provides a Summer Expanded Learning Time with the 
support of Children’s Aid Society. The teaching staff from FLHMS provide summer academic intervention around 
CCLS-aligned curricula and, afterwards, CAS provides enrichment programming in sports, the arts and trips to NYC 
cultural institutions until August. A proposed initiative is to provide Extended Learning Time over holiday breaks with 
the support of CBO partners in academics, athletics and the arts. These ELT academies would be voluntary and open 
to all FLHMS students.  

 

A summary of all ELT events is outlined below: 

 

 

Strategy 1 – Extended Day Academic and Enrichment Activities – Extended Day Academic is a 60 minute block 
for groups of students to receive academic support on key CCL standards. Enrichment activities include 
Basketball, Wrestling, Track and Field, Student Leadership, Art and other student interest activities for one 
hour once-twice a week. Students will be instructed by core curriculum teachers, Special Educators and ENL 
teachers. Enrichment will be provided by CBO partner. AP and CBO leadership will oversee the program. The 
program will be mandated. Parents will be informed throughout the summer of this requirement. All students 
will be kept after school to participate.  
Strategy 2 – Vacation Academy – Students will attend Vacation Academy for academic and enrichment 
activities. Teachers will use a combination of on-line activities and project based learning to increase 
engagement. Students will be instructed by core curriculum teachers, Special Educators and ENL teachers. 
Enrichment will be provided by CBO partner. AP and CBO leadership will oversee the program. This part of the 
program will be voluntary and will require the permission of the family.

Part 2b. Describe how the school will meet the NYCDOE requirements for a Community School in the School Renewal 
program. 
1. 

Renewal Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and together 
with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will lead 
implementation of the asset and needs  assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Renewal Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs  assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Renewal Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and families 
feel welcome,  actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of their 
schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this  family 
engagement strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Renewal School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work. 

Fannie Lou Hamer will engage in collaboration and partnerships with Johns Hopkins University. We will implement a 
research-based school improvement model from Johns Hopkins University. In partnership with Johns Hopkins School 
of Education, the program will provide three layers of tiered support to our school community. Talent Development 
Secondary: a program at Johns Hopkins University that specializes in research and comprehensive school reform 
models to address off-track indicators by working with teachers and administrative staff utilizing data and curriculum. 

Talent Development Secondary (TDS) will partner with Fannie Lou Hamer to provide at-risk students with the tools to 
improve academic achievement. Working with administrators and teachers, the Community School Director, 
Partnership with Children Site Coordinator and Instructional Facilitators for Math and Literacy, TD will help the school 
set goals based on students' attendance, behavior and course performance. They develop a strategic plan, using the 
Data Sorter to implement an early warning system to identify struggling students, and regularly review the data. 
Teachers and the TDS team use common planning time to craft individual student plans that include more math and 
literacy time. For the neediest students, TDS helps form support groups and connects them with community 
resources such as Astor and Partnership with Children. TDS chose both CBO's to support students because each one 
plays a social emotional role in the community and because they will intervene to help resolve problems, celebrate 
positive behavior, and involve students in service learning and enrichment programs. TDS will introduce to SaferSaner 
Schools'" Whole-School Change through Restorative Practices. The International Institute for Restorative Practices 
(IIRP) provides a comprehensive two-year school implementation program using a pro-active approach to whole-
school climate change based on communication and responsibility. IIRP will assist the school leadership team and 
staff to develop a customized plan based on needs and goals, organize professional learning groups (PLG), and 
provide on-site professional development. 

To encourage families to engage more with the staff of Fannie Lou Hamer, TDS will continue participation in the 
weekly scheduled time provided to teachers exclusively for parental outreach. TDS will coordinate an annual Title I 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

Parent Curriculum Conference, host three scheduled Family Conferences and coordinate family conferences on an as 
needed basis throughout the school year. We will work to develop parent leaders to encourage meaningful parent 
participation on School Leadership Teams and the Parent Association. 

The Community School Director will be responsible for leading the successful implementation of Talent Development 
Secondary model approaches to improved student school performance through: effective staff leadership and 
organizational, instructional and curricular changes within the school that result in an improved climate and culture. 
During implementation, the Community School Director offers development and technical support to administrators, 
team leaders, teacher teams, counselors, and support staff. This professional development increases the school’s 
capacity to build positive school climate, collaborative teaching practices, develop and sustain distributive leadership, 
and engage in ongoing collective decision‐making and actions that support student success. 

 

The CSD is the primary liaison between Johns Hopkins University and the leadership and staff of the school, 
responsible for coordinating activities, services, and support including use of the data analysis based on PLC protocols 
to identify, develop, and implement. This process begins with a full needs assessment, collaborative analysis, and 
work plan development based on the findings from the co-interpretation and on-site visit. 

 

 
 
Part 3 – Community School Program Implementation and Oversight 

Part 3a. Key Staff and Partners 
1.  Name and describe the scope of involvement of all community partners working in the school (include partners 

supporting ELT, counseling, enrichment, etc.) 

2.  Name the members of your Community School Team and how meetings will be organized and structured to 

engage all stakeholders and be focused on results. 

3.  Explain data strategies including the use of the data sorter, and steps that the school will take to ensure that the 

appropriate interventions are provided to the right students 

The school administration and Community School Director will partner in implementing the Community School 
program. Data collection and analysis informs the CBO and school leadership in prioritizing identified needs. An 
essential component of the TDS model is data-driven discussion at grade-level team meeting using PLC protocols 
using Data Sorter tools. The data includes what TDS calls the ABC’s— attendance, behavior, and course performance.  

The Data Sorter uses multiple DOE data sources to collect student data profiles for attendance, discipline, and course 
performance. This data is used to analyze grade-level success and areas of focus. Individual student data and is 
reviewed by an interdisciplinary grade-level team on a weekly basis to create, coordinate, and monitor interventions 
for students who are exhibiting early warning signs. 

Classroom observation data from principals and assistant principals using evidence collection tools such as the 
Observation Tracker will provide feedback to teachers while informing TDS and school leadership about areas of 
professional development and practice to be prioritized. Data will inform decisions made at weekly Leadership 
Meetings.  

Three times per year, a TDS Implementation Review will be conducted with school leadership. The process provides a 
forum for honest assessment and feedback involving all parties in using those assessments to set new goals and a 
process for achieving those goals. In the implementation review meeting, the current status of implementation will be 
examined and recommendations will be made for improvement. Action plans are created based upon the discussions, 
and these action plans will become the focus for the School Transformation Planning process with the team.  

To ensure that teacher teams implement interventions in a timely manner, they will review student data weekly and 
use interim assessments and progress reports every five weeks to identify the progress of struggling students. The 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

students involved in these Interventions and their progress is also monitored in the Data Sorter. This systematic 
approach to data collection and analysis offers a comprehensive scheme for individual student assessment to occur 
over time under many conditions. 

The TDS Action Plan, which is updated weekly, is the document that provides assurance that TDS and the school are 
accomplishing, evaluating, and modifying training, support and professional development.

FLHMS 
currently 
has 60 
students 
living in 
temporary 
housing.  

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

With Title 1 funds set aside to support our STH population FLHMS will provide all students in temporary housing with 
school dress code items such as jackets, sweaters, polo shirts and t-shirts in school colors. Providing our STH 
population with these items will help alleviate students' anxiety around peer pressure related to appearance and 
parents anxiety regarding financial hardship. Our STH population will also have the opportunity to receive at risk 
counseling services from our guidance staff. Our Mckinney Vento families will also receive support from our 
counseling staff and from our parent coordinator who will be able to act as a liaison with outside agencies in order to 
obtain additional services for our STH population. There will also be outreach made to the parents via home visits by 
the guidance staff and Assistant Principal in order to open up lines of communications with the families and build 
relationships with the parents and students.

2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and 
paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
1 – Pedagogical Workshops/Professional Learning Communities – teachers will meet in strategically scheduled study 
groups based around interest, experience, subject-area, and/or identified professional learning needs/goals. Study 
groups will be led and/or supported by coaches and/or school-based model teachers. Study groups will choose inquiry 
questions connected to practice and leverage resources from current journal articles, PD provided by partner 
organizations (e.g., Teaching Matters, MSQI, Math Solutions, PBIScience, etc.) to develop action plans to implement 
and monitor in their classroom in order to improve their practice and address student support/extension needs as 
seen in student work and assessments.  

2 – Advisory Intervention Teams – each Monday all grade team who share common students meet to discuss at-risk 
learners. Teachers collect anecdotal and numerical data to assess student strengths and struggles, then teachers 
devise 4-6 week intervention plans to support these at-risk learners in the classroom. Based on this data, teachers 
communicate with families about their child’s progress and needed supports.  

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          74 

 

3 – Grade Team Meetings – grade teams meet weekly to analyze student work across subject area disciplines in one 
grade related to literacy and math struggles. Through this meeting grade-wide common practices are developed 
across classrooms to support student academic achievement and curricula in continually monitored and revised for 
horizontal alignment.  

4 – Vertical Team Meetings – weekly curriculum teams meet to align curriculum to CCLS for their subject area. Using a 
consultancy protocol, lesson plans, and formative (student work) and summative assessments are shared, graded, and 
analyzed to adjust and differentiate curriculum throughout the year. Teams decide on weekly next steps to improve 
instruction and student outcomes that connect to an inquiry question aligned with the instructional vision.  

5 – Behavior Intervention Plan PD’s for paraprofessionals – paras attend year-long training to prepare them for 
dealing with behavior in the classroom.  

6 – Student Intervention Team – Social Worker, Principal, TDS, and PwC staff hold weekly meetings with teachers to 
examine in-depth the needs of high risk students based on data (attendance, ACS involvement, grades, OORS data, 
anecdotal records) in order to create an intervention plan of support. Teachers provide evidence of student academic 
and SEL needs in the classroom setting. 

7 – Leadership Team – in addition to a monthly School Leadership Team meeting, representatives from each grade 
level meet weekly to discuss school-wide operational issues, creating community, students with disabilities, English 
Language Learners, Common Core standards and Parent Involvement. 

8- New Teacher Support - NTC Mentor Teachers support new teachers throughout the school year with weekly 
coaching, intervisitation of experienced teachers and scripted classroom visits with feedback. Principal and designee 
will monitor NTC Mentor Teachers with their log entries and with monthly meetings to review progress and next 
steps.

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
In June of previous year, all teachers met to discuss their next MoSL steps and choices based on the prior experience. 
All subject area Vertical Teams met after the workshop to discuss the best assessment system for the goals of their 
CCLS-aligned curriculum. Vertical Teams also worked collaboratively to align Unit Plans to the Common Core 
Standards using standards to determine summative assessment outcomes. Vertical Teams meet monthly to continue 
collecting, grading and analyzing student formative or summative assessments to align them to CCLS and MoSL 
assessments. In September, teachers were provided with a workshop and materials updating them on the MoSL 
assessment system for 14-15 and its impact on their evaluation. Teacher preference was communicated to the MoSL 
committee. After examining choices and assessing the needs of the school, the committee approved the choices and 
they were entered in the ADVANCE system. 

 

Teachers also researched and identified criterion- and norm-based common benchmark assessments to be 
administered periodically school-wide. This includes the DRP assessment of reading level and i-Ready (replacing 
MAP/ELAP) assessments of literacy and math-based CCLS across the subject areas. This year, based on feedback from 
teachers and in order to ease data collection and analysis, we will continue to leverage Mastery Connect to track and 
data and monitor for trends. Teachers support the school in June and during August Staff Institute to finalize an 
assessment calendar that will provide the most useful timing for teachers to leverage the data to support student 
achievement and improve student outcomes.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (RSCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          77 

 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent 
Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
In examining the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data for our incoming 6th grade ELLs, we saw 
that 11 new students are at the Entering or Emerging level out of 45 ELL's.  For our 
ELLs entering 7th grade and 8th grade, we have another 9  Entering and Emerging ELLs.  Last 
year, of 17 ENL learners only one learner remained at Emerging level.  Thus, all but 1 of our 
Entering and Emerging students made gains.  Based on this data, we want to continue to support 
the gains of students at the Emerging and Entering level.  We plan to implement a targeted 
supplemental program for this group of "newcomers" to take place during our Extended Learning 
Time (ELT), three times a week.  This program will target specific needs of the group, including 
building phonemic awareness in English, studying sight words, basic reading fluency and 
comprehension, listening activities with comprehensible input, and writing tasks with scaffolds.   
 
The program will start on Thursday September 12, 2018 and run through June 27, 2019.  The 
hours of the program will be Tuesdays through Thursdays, 2:40pm - 3:55pm.  The total number 
of sessions for each section will be 100.  There will be two ELT classes, one for the 6th graders 
and one combined class for the 7th graders and 8th grade newcomers providing services for 
approximately 11 6th graders and 10 7th and 8th graders.  Combined, the two classes will 
account for 200 hours.   
 
Additional funding sources will be used to supplement Title III funding.  The small class size 
will allow for late-registering students.  These classes will be taught by 2 ENL teachers in 
English with native language support, such as bilingual glossaries and dictionaries, strategic 
grouping, and using native language discussions. Advanced literacy strategies will be used 
throughout co-taught integrated classrooms. Sheltered instruction will be provided using the 
research-based text from Pearson Longman Keystone, Building Bridges.  In addition, 
supplemental support for students will be provided with native language resources through 
Imagine Learning Literacy. Records will be maintained, including student attendance in the ENL 
binder in room 511.  Parents will be notified in their preferred language.  
 
Student progress will be monitored using Mastery Connect.  Teachers will assign specific 
Common Core Bilingual Standards to this class and assess them as a baseline.  Teacher will then 
track those standards with formative and summative assessments.  The results of student progress 
will be part of the school Report Card and Progress Reports.  These documents are bilingual and 
are given to the parents, sent home or used as part of the Family Conference.  
 
The program will not conflict with other teacher meetings.  Because we are a Renewal School 
with a Mandatory Extended Learning Time, the teachers voted to create an alternate schedule for 
Professional Development and Parent Involvement time that would not conflict with ELT. Thus, 
the ENL teachers will be able to provide extra services for English Language Learners.

Begin description here:            
The FLHMS staff has two certified ENL teachers as well as two certified bilingual teachers.  Our 
two ENL Title III Program teachers will meet once a week to collaborate on planning for the 
"newcomers" program, assessing student work, reflecting on their practices, and studying new 
literature to strengthen and focus their delivery of instruction.  In addition, all ENL teachers will 
meet weekly at a "co-teaching" coaching session to learn best practices in mentoring GE teachers 
in ENL strategies.  The ENL teachers meet weekly with their GE co-teachers to plan lessons and 
to provide coaching on including scaffolds for ENL students based on the Bilingual Common 
Core progressions.   
 
In addition to these weekly meetings, the school will also have monthly sessions to analyze data 
and determine instructional next steps for the ENL subgroup.  Topics will include: language 
acquisition through content-based instruction, content and language objectives, building 
background knowledge, comprehensible input, differentiating ideas, and accommodating 
students experiencing cultural dissonance. 
 
Our ENL liaison will continue to attend monthly PD sessions offered by the Bronx Field Support 
Center focused on ENL learning in the classroom in addition to compliance related issues. Our 
liaison will turnkey this information to the rest of the staff during team meetings and a ENL 
focused Monday professional learning series in the school. 
 
Our ENL teachers will meet with our NYS/NYC Regional Bilingual/ESL Resource Network 
(RBE-RN) Resource Specialist, Elise Cardona-Berardinelli, throughout the year and participate 
in data analysis, analysis of instruction and revisions to pedagogy and curriculum, and 
monitoring and debriefing our plan with leadership. Our teachers may also attend workshops and 
conferences as professional learning opportunities as offered through throughout the year.  
 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

Since our Title III Program targets Newcomers, our Parental Engagement Activities will also 
target the needs of our Newcomer families.  We will host two events for these families in our 
school, one in the fall and one in late spring.  We will also have one family trip on a Saturday in 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          87 

 

 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
early spring to build community and trust among the newcomer families with one another and 
with the school staff. 
In October in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, the school will organize an international dinner 
held at our school with students and parents bringing in dishes that represent their cultural 
heritage.  There will also be a workshop portion with the goal of welcoming our new families to 
our community and to build relationships at the beginning of the school year.  We will also use 
this opportunity to create focus groups to survey families to gain an understanding of the 
experience they bring to the school and ask them about concerns they have for their children's 
learning.  This session will be provided by Berquis Arias, ENL teacher.   
Our second workshop will be about preparing for summer learning and activities.  Our families 
live in a city full or resources.  Our bilingual workshop will have families access these resources 
for themselves and their children.   This session will be provided by Berquis Arias, ENL 
teacher.   
Each in-school event will be two hours long with a half-hour given to teachers to prepare for the 
events.  $250 will be allocated for additional food for these events. 
In the spring, we will organize a family trip to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island 
Museum.  Students, parents, and teachers will visit the iconic landmark and learn about the 
history of immigration in the United States.  This trip will be led by Berquis Arias, ENL teacher. 
Records, including agendas, attendance sheets, and invitations in parents' preferred languages, 
will be maintained in the ENL binder in room 511.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our students are placed in heterogeneous groups according to their proficiency levels identified by the NYSESLAT from the 
previous spring.  Assessments that are used during the current school year include the DRP, Fountas and Pinnel Benchmark 
Assessment System, i-Ready, Words Their Way spelling inventory, and Word Generation. These assessments provide us with a 
detailed analysis of our  ELL students' literacy skills. Specifically, the interim assessments, Word Generation, and DRP provide 
us with data about students' reading comprehension. Fountas and Pinnel Benchmark Assessment System measures students' 
fluency, and i-Ready teaches students the building blocks of literacy in English and provides us with students' proficiency 
in phonetic awareness and academic vocabulary acquisition, as well as their reading levels. These data inform our strategic 
reading groups and reciprocal teaching groups.  We are targeting instruction in the four modalities of speaking, listening, 
reading and writing, which aligns with the areas tested on the NYSESLAT, in order to ensure that our ELL student population 
will achieve academic proficiency in each of the content areas.

Once NYSESLAT scores are released, groups are created and the language-learning levels are shared with the content 
teachers.  Assessments during the school year are administered according to our assessment calendar. Scores are shared with 
content teachers during grade-level meetings and groups as well as individual learners' progresses are re-evaluated.  Our ENL 
teacher supports teachers in differentiating instruction to support their ELL students, and our coach from Fordham University 
supports teachers with integrated and sheltered techniques. In addition, we provide on-site professional development for the 
whole staff throughout the school year.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We utilize three assessments which are used to identify baseline data and measure progress, as well as areas of need. We 
primarily utilize i-Ready diagnostic assessments, which are administered three times (September, January, May), to provide us 
with baseline and progress data. In addition, we use Imagine Learning Language & Literacy and Imagine Math to both measure 
progress and support students' areas of need. Teachers are provided with specific student-level data and next steps, which 
they utilize in their planning.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Summative data are shared with content-area teachers during grade-level meetings. The data are disaggregated to support 
teachers in determining areas of need and appropriate interventions. As a team, in conjunction with our ENL teacher and 
Fordham University coach, plans are created to address specific interventions, both in class (such as small-group instruction 
and Imagine Learning Language & Literacy and Imagine Math Facts), as well as out of class (such as Saturday Academy).  Our 
Supplemental Title II programs, Imagine Learning Language & Literacy and Imagine Math & Math Facts, provide teachers with 
specific student-level data, which they utilize in their planning. Saturday Academy (also Title III) serves as a time for students to 
receive additional small group instruction, as well as time to further their literacy & math skills using Imagine Learning 
Language & Literacy and Imagine Math & Math Facts. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our school uses data (NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, ELA, Fountas and Pinnell, Degrees of Reading Progress, TCRWP running records, 
unit tests, etc.) to provide high quality instruction for ELLs within RTI. Fountas and Pinnell, for example, is used by ENL and 
classroom teachers during Reading Workshop to group students according to their reading level. The NYSESLAT data is used to 
plan instruction that targets specific ELLs' needs in the Speaking, Listening, Reading, and Writing modalities. Thanks to these 
data points the teacher can adjust instruction according to specific student needs. This allows for monitoring whether students 
are responding to in-class interventions. The role of the ENL teacher is to analyze the data from the standpoint of a TESOL 
professional with focus on the process of second language acquisition. The ENL teachers assures that the interventions are 
ELL-appropriate. This Tier I intervention takes place throughout the day including the time when push-in ENL services are 
delivered. If progress is not made despite intervention, the teachers can determine whether to continue providing other 
interventions or to submit an RTI Referral Form to the administration to convene the RTI Committee to discuss the student's 
case. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
It is our observation that low NYSESLAT writing scores is the primary factor preventing students from reaching the proficiency 
level.  Many of our students' writing scores went down from the previous year.   We are addressing this with an increased 
emphasis on writing and writing mechanics to expand and reinforce English proficiency skills and literacy.  We will also take a 
closer look at the newly revised NYSESLAT to see how our instruction aligns to it's current demands.  Students generally test at 
proficient in speaking after two or three years, at proficient in listening after two or three years, but they take longer to test at 
proficient in reading and writing.  Instruction is based more on oral language (speaking and listening) at the beginning levels of 
second language acquisition and transitions to literacy (reading and writing) at the intermediate and advanced levels.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          92 

 

 

We have intentionally designed our school schedule to provide multiple opportunities to build teachers' capacity to design and 
implement rigorous instruction that is differentiated to meet students' individual needs. Teachers  meet weekly in grade-level 
and content teams, and teachers are provided opportunities to attend school-based and external professional learning. We 
design professional learning opportunities based on data collected through the observation cycle. Thus, data regarding ELLs is 
primarily disseminated through teacher team meetings. have schoolwide protocols to support teachers in analyzing data and 
determining appropriate next steps including determining specific adjustments to our program.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our ELL students are served in integrated and standalone ENL settings.  ENL students are blocked together as a class 
that travels together where they receive service from a teacher with dual certification (content and TESOL) or co-
taught with a content teacher and the ENL teacher.  Entering and Emerging students are grouped together for 180 
minutes/week for an additional level of support and are instructed by a certified TESOL teacher.   
ENL is taught through an integrated curriculum that includes reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Ongoing 
articulation between our ENL certified teachers and classroom teachers ensure that content-based ENL instruction is 
complimentary to what students are learning in their mainstream classrooms. Our ENL certified teachers are required 
to deliver academic rigorous lessons using various literacy models. Flexible grouping and cooperative learning engage 
students in communicative, cognitive, and metacognitive activities in our ENL program. We strive to meet the goals 
and expectations established by our Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) and our language needs assessment. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

All ELL students (Entering-Commanding) in grades K-8 are grouped heterogenously in graded blocks. They receive four periods 
(180 minutes) of integrated ENL with the ENL teacher pushing-in to their content area class--primarily ELA, and in additional 
subjects (social studies and science) as necessary. An additional unit of standalone ENL instruction (180 minutes) is provided 
for Entering and Emerging ELLs in heterogeneous groups by a certified TESOL teacher. At this time, HLA is not delivered to 
students; however, all standalone and integrated ENL courses offer native language texts/supports for students to ensure 
entry points to the curriculum. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Instruction in the core content classes is in English with Spanish support when needed.  Modifications to the instruction are 
made during the planning phase.  Support and scaffolding is provided for ELLs during daily read alouds, class discussions, 
strategic reading groups, Word Generation lessons, debates, and presentations.  Thematic planning is implemented when 
possible.  Common routines and language are planned for and used across grades.  Common Core Learning Standards are 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          93 

 

chosen with care during the planning stage and ELL scaffolding is made sure to lead to the meeting or approaching of these 
standards. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

After new ELLs have been identified through the HLIS and NYSITELL, they are given the Spanish Lab assessment (when SP is 
their L1). There is no baseline home language evaluation for languages other than Spanish. Spanish running record to 
determine literacy in Spanish 
 
Our classrooms have leveled libraries, including books in Spanish.  Spanish language content material in math, social studies 
and science are also available when needed.  Bilingual glossaries of content area terminology are given to each beginner and 
intermediate student for use in the monolingual classroom.  Teachers also access Reading A-Z to print and use Spanish texts 
and comprehension questions.  Laptops are used regularly throughout the school year. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. SIFECurrently, our school has five students labeled as SIFE. ENL teachers receive training through professional development 
workshops on SIFE identification and early assessment for this population. We keep in mind the unique needs of SIFE students 
who cope not only with the language difference, but also concerns that may arise due to lack of formal educational 
experiences and adjusting to a new culture. To address these needs, we focus on vocabulary, language patterns/structures and 
acquainting them with the culture of the school environment. Our plan for SIFE students is based on strategically placing them 
in classes where additional help from staff (teachers and/or paraprofessionals) speaking the student's home language is 
available. In addition to standalone ENL sessions four periods a week (180 minutes) and four periods of integrated ENL 
instruction (180 minutes), SIFE students would also be provided with additional instruction time during Title III after school 
program and Saturday Academy. b. NewcomerNewcomers (0-3 years) mostly have scored in the Entering/Emerging range and 
are pulled out four times a week to receive intensive English instruction. We use several resources to supplement our 
curricula. Imagine Learning Language & Literacy and Imagine Math & Math Facts are used to build students' literacy and math 
proficiency. We also use myON which further supplements literacy instruction by enabling students to listen to books as they 
read them.  
 
In ELA, newcomer ELLs receive targeted intervention during strategic reading groups with the ENL teacher.  In math, 
newcomer ELLs work in groups based on math ability but with support in language using ENL methodologies including native 
language scaffolds.  In social studies and science, a similar structure is created for newcomer ELLs in that they receive support 
in their native language, through interpretation from the teacher or a designated peer, and translation of key instructions and 
content.  Our groupings were based on the NYSESLAT data from the previous spring and is augmented by the results of the 
September DPR, the ELL periodic assessment, content state scores where applicable, and running records. Imagine Learning 
Language & Literacy and Imagine Math & Math Facts are used to build students' literacy and math proficiency. They are also 
targeted for the Title III after school program and Saturday Academy.  
c. DevelopingDeveloping ELLs (4-6 years of service) are targeted during strategic reading groups with the ENL teacher.  In 
math, ELLs work in groups based on math ability but with support in language using ENL methodologies including native 
language scaffolds.  In social studies and science, a similar structure is created for newcomer ELLs in that they receive support 
in their native language, through interpretation from the teacher or a designated peer, and translation of key instructions and 
content.  Imagine Learning Language & Literacy and Imagine Math & Math Facts are used to build students' literacy and math 
proficiency. They are also targeted for the Title III after school program and Saturday Academy. d. Long TermLTELLs (7+ years) 
are targeted with high-interest reading material.  Imagine Learning Language & Literacy and Imagine Math & Math Facts are 
used to build students' literacy and math proficiency. They are also targeted for the Title III after school and Saturday 
Academy. e. Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL statusFormer ELLs continue to receive testing accommodations for 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          94 

 

two years after testing Proficient/Commanding. Additionally, former ELLs are programmed in classes with current ELLs for at 
least two years after testing out and therefore receive the support of the push-in ENL teacher. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
At Fannie Lou Hamer, we believe in providing academic intervention, as well as socio-emotional intervention designed to 
provide early effective assistance to our English Language Learners who are having difficulties.  If an ELL student is suspected 
of having special needs, it is very important that academic interventions are tried and the results recorded before any formal 
assessment or review is requested.  At Fannie Lou Hamer there we have an Instructional Support Team (IST) in place whose 
goals are to maximize individual student success in the regular classroom, while at the same time serving as a screening 
process for students who may be in a need of special education services.  The team includes an ENL Teacher and/or the ELL 
Specialist.  We also have a Student Intervention Team (SIT) which addresses the socio-emotional needs of the students.   
 
We use a variety of instructional strategies to support ELL-SWD's.  Teachers implement the Universal Design for Learning while 
by looking a student data to drive instruction.  Lessons are taught using the SMART board and practice of lessons is done by 
working in small groups.  Students are engaged in lesson activities are broken down into simple steps that use graphic 
organizers and build vocabulary development. 
 
Those students who come with an IEP from another school and/or were going through CSE reviews prior to attending Fannie 
Lou Hamer are reviewed to ascertain if the ELL student is struggling with language difficulty or if the student has special 
needs.  Students are assessed and evaluated on an on-going basis to assure they were appropriately placed. 
 
If a student is to receive bilingual counseling, he or she can visit the bilingual counselor in PS66, with whom we share a 
building.  Students whose IEP mandates ENL instruction will receive instruction from the ENL teacher in co-teaching and 
standalone settings, with a paraprofessional if required. 
 There is an IEP teacher who monitors the IEPs of all students, including ELL-SWDs, to ensure that all students receive the 
services they are entitled to.  The ENL teachers Speech and OT/PT providers and are in regular dialogue with each other about 
student progress. Each classroom is equipped with a large leveled library.  This ensures that all students will have access to 
engaging and appropriate text.  ELL classrooms also have a Spanish library, and middle school ELL classrooms have a variety of 
graphic novels and books on lower reading levels for students who need them; we are working to grow a Hi-Lo library as 
well.  As described in Item III-1, all students are tested using F&P and DRP and are made aware of their reading level.The 
curriculum makes it possible for teachers to choose mentor texts that will be rigorous but still engaging and appropriate for 
their students.  Teachers can select a text that they know is available in several other languages and can be readily made 
available in Spanish.  Teachers may also choose a text that has a graphic novel or other version that can be presented to 
students as another support.ENL teachers work with ELA teachers to add Language Objectives into unit plans and to use the 
New Language Progressions to differentiate instruction.  Visual supports such as PowerPoints, along with printed vocabulary 
words with pictures are used.  Best practices from the SIOP model are integrated into instruction, which benefit all students, 
ELL and ELL-SWD alike. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
To attain English proficiency in the least restrictive environment and achieve IEP goals, ELL-SWDs are often placed in ICT 
classes. Additionally, the TESOL teacher pushes in to these classes during the ELA period to provide integrated ENL instruction. 
Some ELL-SWDs that need further support receive additional AIS services from a special education teacher (typically the same 
teacher that is providing ICT services on a particular grade).If ELL-SWDs are either Entering or Emerging proficiency levels, they 
are pulled out an additional four periods (180 minutes) a week to receive standalone ENL. Such an environment allows 
teachers to meet both the language and special education needs. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          95

*Peer Group Connection (8th graders mentor 6th graders)**Peer Mediation and Conflict Resolution (English/Spanish)*Boys 
and Girls Basketball*Choice Classes (students choose classes quarterly based on interest - e.g. dancing, journalism, etc.) 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

NYSESLAT data revealed that last year our students either plateaued or did not grow in reading, writing, and listening. We 
chose  Imagine Learning Language & Literacy because it is designed to increased reading comprehension for ELLs. 
 
All students performed below grade level on math. As a result, we invested in Imagine Math, which provides instruction in 
Spanish, the predominate HL for our ELLs. 
 
In addition we targeted these students for our Title III after school program and Saturday Academy. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded access to all programs identified in #8. In addition to ELT, ELL students are offered after school tutoring - 
specifically designed to work on all four modalities- and Saturday Academy.  In increasing their linguistic and academic 
performance, Imagine Learning Language & Literacy, Imagine Math & Math Facts , and i-Ready will be utilized in ELT and 
Saturday Academy to provide additional support in vocabulary acquisition, fluency and comprehension through auditory and 
visual practice. Additional materials will include building fluency through Reader’s Theater which provides the necessary 
support and scaffolding needed in order to provide effective instruction to our ELL students in the areas of reading, writing, 
listening and speaking.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
In addition to technology, teachers use pictures, videos, graphic organizers, auditory listening to texts, labels, process charts, 
and language stems to support ELL students in their learning. We offer a multitude of instructional materials and technology to 
support ELL students:   
 
myON offers texts on all levels and enables students to listen to books as they read.    
 
Imagine Learning Language & Literacy, and Imagine Math & Math Facts targets students' gaps and provides instruction in 
Spanish and English. 
Finally, all classroom libraries have books at all levels and English/L1 dictionaries (as well as content area/specific dictionaries--
i.e. science, math, social studies provided from the NYC DOE website). Teachers utilize Spanish literature/supplemental texts 
and employ differentiated ELL teacher accommodations (i.e. graphic organizers, sentence frames, word banks, etc.). 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is delivered in our ESL model in a variety of ways.  Our classrooms have leveled libraries, including 
books in Spanish.  Spanish language content material in math, social studies and science are also available when 
needed.  Bilingual glossaries of content area terminology are given to each beginner and intermediate student for use in the 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          96 

 

 

monolingual classroom.  Teachers also access Reading A-Z to print and use Spanish texts and comprehension 
questions.  Laptops are used regularly throughout the school year. 
  
Students arriving new to the country are placed in small groups for ENL instruction.  They take part in extra tutoring sessions to 
develop their basic communication skills. The native language speakers are usually placed in a monolingual setting with a 
teacher who speaks Spanish. Native language speaking students with special needs are placed in the mandated setting 
according to their IEP. We use the following systems to assess, evaluate and support our ELL students, our special needs 
students and our long-term ELLs:  Fountas & Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System and Imagine Learning. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

ELL student regardless of language are exposed to grade level appropriate materials.  The materials are scaffolded for the 
students as to optimize the student learning.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The principals from both schools do monthly campus rounds to discuss and share best practices, which includes our ELLs. In 
addition, we share resources and promising practices for both ELLs and SWDs.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
At the end of the school year, all incoming middle school students are invited to attend an orientation session to become 
familiar with the expectations of middle school (i.e. meet teachers, grading policy/Honor Roll, CCLS, extracurricular 
programs/activities).  We use this time to have students take an incoming assessment, so that we can determine students' 
baseline academically and to learn more about their linguistic and personal history.  This includes completing the HLIS form as 
well as taking the NYSITELL and, if applicable, the Spanish Lab.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

At FLHMS we offer students language elective through the use of Rosetta Stone.  The languages that are offered are French, 
Spanish, Italian, Arabic, Portuguese, and English. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our new teachers are in the process of completing the state mandated requirement of 7.5 hours in ENL training. All of our 
teachers are kept informed of other professional development opportunities focusing on second language acquisition, and 
effective ENL strategies and methodologies.  During the month of February all staff members, including office staff, are 
involved in in-house workshops and professional development that create a rigorous learning environment that focuses on 
academic achievement and language development for English Language Learners.  Classroom teachers have the opportunity to 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          97 

 

 

attend ENL workshops at the Fannie Lou Hamer, at the New York State Association of Bilingual Education (NYSABE) Teacher 
Institute, and ENL events at NYS TESOL - NYC Region. Our ENL certified teachers and ELL Specialist also conduct ENL training 
during faculty conferences and grade conferences.  Starting this year, PD activities will go beyond the mandated 7.5 hours for 
all staff and will include additional activities for each group of pedagogues.  15% of all PD will address language acquisition. For 
ENL teachers, 50% of PD will be dedicated to language acquisition. 
We, at Fannie Lou Hamer, strive to provide strong professional development for our staff which meet the specific needs of our 
ELL population with topics which include: 
Teachers of ELL students will have an increased opportunity to improve their practice, deepen content/subject knowledge and 
increase their understanding of ELL student need and strengths.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
At FLHMS, teachers receive on-going staff development from our Fordham University Consultant, ENL teacher and Bronx Field 
Support Center also provides workshops presented. These professional development sessions provide strategies and methods 
so that the ELL students can be included and participate in classroom lessons.  
Additionally, we have an ELL team that meets bi-monthly to discuss the ELL programs and strategies for enhancing student 
learning.  This team consists of all bilingual education/ENL teachers on staff.  These certified staff members also conduct full-
staff PD to meet the 15% requirement.  Agendas and attendance are kept in the ENL binder located in the Principal's 
office. Professional development topics include: strategies for English Language Learners including QTEL, Language Acquisition 
vs. Learning Disability, and Adapting Teachers College Reading and Writing Project Units of Study to Meet the Needs of ELLs.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In the Fall we have Meet the Teacher Night which provides all parents, including our ELL parents, the opportunity to meet the 
teacher and become familiar with expectations and procedures. This is a highly attended event. In order to accommodate our 
ELL parents we provide them with native language oral and written interpretation and translation.  In addition, the Parent 
Coordinator is responsible for informing and coordinating the event where parents attend the annual Parent Institute at the 
New York State Association of Bilingual Education (NYSABE) Conference which provides them with opportunities to network 
and learn how to support and address the needs of their child.  This event takes place every year in March, and provides 
parents with translation services.  In addition, we will hold an ELL family night.  We invite the students and their families in 
order to showcase the ELL student projects and technology work.  Annual meetings with parents are conducted by the ENL 
teacher who works with the student.  These meetings take place on a one-to-one basis and are scheduled by the ENL teacher 
to take place during the school day when he or she is available and/or after school in the evening, if that is more convenient 
for the parent.  If necessary, an interpreter is there to assist. 
 
The ENL teacher maintains an ENL binder that contains agendas, sign-in sheets, and logs. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

ELL parent involvement at the school is consistent with non-ELL parents.  Parents of ELLs are invited to parent events and are 
made aware that language services will be provided when needed. Parent meetings aimed specifically toward the ELL parent 
population will occur several times a year, to inform them of the practices in our school as well as bring their voices into our 
school community.  Traditionally, parents and families of ELLs are underrepresented in school activities, and our goal is to 
provide time and place to change this here.  The parent coordinator's role here is to make sure that families are contacted and 
have a secure connection to the school by communicating with them as well as communicating with staff about family needs.

In an effort to increase parent involvement and meet the needs of our families, we offer ESL classes for parents on Saturdays 
and ESL / Spanish Literacy for parents on Wednesdays. 
 
Our Parent Coordinator organizes Latidos Unidos, which brings together Latino/a parents to surface issues that may be 
impacting Latino communities. The Parent Coordinator also organize trips for all ELL parents to build the home-school 
connection.  Translation services are provided at all sessions/events (often by a bilingual parent volunteer). The Parent 
Coordinator maintains a binder of agendas, sign-in sheets, and materials as mandated.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Abbey Wilson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The language preferences of our parents in written communication, including letters, announcements, etc, and 
oral communication for teacher conferences, orientations, information meetings, etc., are identified from various 
sources. The data and methodologies used to assess language preferences come from the two questions that 
make up part III of the HLIS, ATS reports where this information is included, Student Emergency Contact cards 
where parents record their preferred language of communication, and surveys conducted by the school. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In case of emergency, all families are notified using the Robocall system. The system also provides translation in all 
native languages of the student population. Language Line is a 24/7 resource that can be used for instant 
communication in over 200 languages. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Part of our professional development time in the beginning of the year will be dedicated to ensuring that all staff 
members are aware of how we can provide language assistance service to Limited English Speaking parents so that 
they can participate fully in school positions and activities. Language Line, for example, is a 24/7 resources that can be 
used for instant communication in over 200 languages and the resource is shared with staff at the beginning of the 
year. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Parents will be given a parents' bill of rights in the language of their preference. This will be made available to them at 
the ELL orientation as well as during the parent-teacher conferences. They will also be provided with a copy of 
parents' guide to language access during these times. Preferred languages will be seen in the welcome poster as well 
as the language ID guide at the security desk and main office.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parent surveys will be made available to attendees of one of our parent events, including the ELL orientation and 
parent-teacher conferences. We have increased school documents available in common languages and provided staff 
and parents with access to Language Line is a 24/7 resources that can be used for instant communication in over 200 
languages. Finally, we adopted Skedula which allows parents and staff to communicate in their preferred language 
and translates to the preferred language of the receiver.
