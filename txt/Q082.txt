Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Our vision for PS82Q is a collaborative school that fosters high expectations for all through a shared vision of creating 
future leaders who can think critically and problem solve. Our mission is that at P.S.82Q, we promote relevant and 
rigorous expectations for all, encouraging students to reach their full potential. Working collaboratively, we build 
strong, trusting, positive relationships among students, teachers, and parents. As a learning community, we 
continuously expand our knowledge and empower our students to take risks and apply their learning to real world 
experiences. 

 

Our mission will be accomplished through the utilization of a System wide Approach to Rigor, Relevance, and 
Relationships (International Center for Leadership in Education). Through the use of a Rigor/Relevance Framework, 
students will be engaging in challenging tasks that demonstrate in-depth conceptual understanding. To enhance 
engagement and application, students will be challenged to apply their learning to real world situations across various 
disciplines. And, lastly, strong relationships between parents - teachers - students are viewed as a critical component 
in affecting student achievement. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 82 Queens, The Hammond School, is an educational community that services a diverse population in Jamaica, 
Queens. Our school is located in a densely populated neighborhood comprised of apartment houses and private 
homes. This school services approximately 670 students in kindergarten through fifth grade. We are an overcrowded 
school working beyond capacity. As a result, our kindergarten is housed at an Annex located one mile from our main 
building. The majority of our students and their families are newly arrived immigrants from Central and South 
America, the Caribbean, Guyana, Bangladesh and other parts of Asia. The vast majority of our students come from 
low-income homes, which has enabled P.S. 82 Queens to be classified as a Title I and Universal Meal Program school. 
The Universal Meal Program entitles all our students in the main building and Annex to be eligible for free lunch. Our 
school is very well maintained and barrier free. In both the main building and the Annex, student work is displayed for 
the school community and visitors to view. Other displays include the vision, mission, and instructional focus, student 
of the month and virtue of the month, graphs of class data for monthly My-On Reader competitions and a bulletin 
board dedicated for parent events. Throughout the building you will see our our school mascot (lion) and our PBIS 
matrix. (cid:127)(cid:127) 

 

According to the 2016-17 P.S. 82Q NYSED data (sourced from the 2016-17 School Quality Guide), our demographics 
are: 63.9% Hispanic, 25.7% Asian, 6.7% Black or African American, 1.5% American Indian and 2% White. In addition, 
16.6% are students with special needs and 33.1% are English as a New Language Learner. Among these students, the 
dominant language is Spanish; other languages include but are not limited to Bengali, Urdu and Arabic. The school's 
Economic Need Index is 67.8% and 9.1% of students are in temporary housing (representing 59 students).  

 

At PS82 we believe in developing the whole child, preparing students for academic success, developing social and 
emotional skills and taping into their creative abilities. Aside from our core academic subjects, students partake in 
Physical Education, Art, Computers/Technology, and - new in 2017-18 -- Dance. Starting in the 2018-19 school year, 
we will be adding a STEM cluster in which all students in Grades 1-5 will be engaging in hands-on activities including 
Robotics, 3D printing, and coding projects. In addition to our rigorous instruction, students in PS82Q also engage in 
daily Power Brain and Positive Behavior Intervention Supports (P.B.I.S.). We have names each of our corridors after 
one of the 10 virtues we celebrate (Honesty Highway. Responsibility Road, Loyalty Lane, etc. Students receive "paw 
passes" daily as a reward for positive behavior and are allowed to go shopping in our PBIS store with their passes. The 
school also has an established Student Government/Council which works with the WE organization and its charitable 
endeavors. Additionally, the students publish a seasonal newspaper highlighting school news and events. In the 2017-
18 School Year, a cohort of teachers/school staff were trained in Restorative Circles by the Morningside Center for 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Teaching Social Responsibility. These trained personnel engaged in "Circles" with students during and after school in 
order to help develop critical skills including empathy, community building, and conflict resolution.  

 

This year as a way of connecting with the arts, we will have in and after school programs which include a Dance 
company, our Lions Soccer Team, the Mighty Milers running club, Musical Theater program, Broadway Dance training, 
and Filmmaking. Specifically, our Lions team, is comprised of our third, fourth and fifth grade students. The Lions play 
against other schools in the community. The Mighty Milers Running club is part of the New York Road Runners 
Organization and allows our students to participate in District competitions. The Dance Company was able to engage 
in professional training with Lincoln Center and other venues. Our Student Government also includes a community 
service element including charity work, fundraising for a global initiative, visiting animal shelters, and participating in a 
WE Organization event.  

 

We are a community school, allowing many opportunities for parents to engage in the learning and excitement at PS 
82. Some of the activities we have throughout the year are "Dad Bring Your Child to School Day", Cultural Night, Math 
Night, Literacy Night, Special Someone Dance, Seusville, Soccer Games, Talent Shows, Harvest Celebration, Movie 
Nights, STEM night, Parent Come Learn with Us, and Awards Assemblies. This year we are partnering with the 
organization Soccer Space, opening up our building to the entire community. On Sunday afternoons, Soccer Space will 
conduct soccer lessons for children between the ages of 2-10, including our students. Each grade level teacher team 
will develop and faciliate three parent workshops throughout the year, this will also include activities led by the 
Cluster team.  

 

Our instructional focus for 2018-19 is as follows: 

Teachers will engage students in discussions focused on text-dependent questions by ensuring that questions: 

-Require students read the text to answer the question 

-Include scaffolding for all students to understand what is being asked 

- Build towards gradual understanding of the text 

-Provide opportunities for students to determine the meaning of academic vocabulary in context 

 

Desired Accomplishment: Students build comprehension skills and engage in critical thinking. 

 

To achieve the 2018-19 focus, we are working collaboratively as an instructional cabinet, to engage teachers in 
research-based strategies in discussion, questioning, and student ownership. We will be specifically targeting 
Danielson Component 3B - Using Questioning and Discussion techniques. As a result of professional learning and 
administration feedback, teachers will utilize varied targeted, research-based discussion/questioning strategies with 
the onus of students guiding the discussion. All students will be engaged in goal-setting and targeted work to support 
their individual goals. As a result, student ownership will be achieved.

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

At P.S. 82 we work hard to meet the needs of our diverse learners (17% of population) and the high population of 
English Language Learners (33% of population) in our school community. To support our ELLs and their parents, we 
run a 4-month Saturday Academy which engages students in activities to help them build their academic language 
and listening and speaking skills. In addition, as part of this program, we provide art instruction with the focus on 
supporting the students in language acquisition. In addition, while students are engaged in their classes, their parents 
are receiving instruction on strategies to support their children socially, emotionally and academically. At the end of 
the 4-month series, parents receive a certificate of participation and have a cultural celebration. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, we made the most progress in the component of Strong Family-
Community Ties, from a 2.45 rating in 2016-17 to a 3.53 rating in 2017-18. This year we will work on the component 
of Trust, our lowest rated element within the Framework for Great schools (2.55 for 2017-18), focusing on building 
collaboration and trust among teachers and administrators.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

The 2017-18 School Quality Guide (including the 2017-18 School Survey and the 2017 Quality Review Report), the 
2017-18 PPO Written Feedback Report, the 2017 NYS ELA and Math Assessments, and an analysis of the 2017-18 
Met/Not Met NYS ELA and Math preliminary measures were analyzed to determine areas of strengths and areas for 
improvement. 

 

Strengths - 

According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, we see a slight increase in this element of the framework (from 3.35 
in 2016-17 to 3.43 in 2017-18). According to the School Survey, 84% of teachers report that students feel challenged 
and 88% noted that students have to work hard to do well. A total of 85% of teachers say that they had the resources 
to include opportunities for students to interact with academic language and 82% of teachers noted that had 
resources to include opportunities for students to engage in evidence-based learning in both literary and 
informational texts. In terms of math, 82% of teachers noted that they had the resources to help develop student's 
conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, and application capabilities in mathematics.  

According to the 2016-17 Quality Review Report, the school received a well-developed in ensuring engaging, rigorous, 
and coherent curricula in all subjects aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. The report noted that an 
emphasis on the instructional shifts is evident in planning curriculum. Furthermore, a focus for instruction was to 
support a gradual release model across grades and across content areas. Additionally, it was noted that teachers 
posed questions designed to elicit critical thinking and engage all learners in higher-order thinking. 

The 2017-18 PPO Written Feedback noted that short and long-term goals for students were based on various data 
points collected and analyzed. The report noted that, "students' areas of deficiencies in content standards were used 
to create the learning targets for specific grades. These learning targets were tracked and monitored on an interim 
basis throughout the year for progress checks and, if necessary, to adjust/refine any instructional practices with the 
ultimate objective of attaining their goals."  

In terms of overall performance on the 2017 NYS ELA exam, 30% of students achieved proficiency levels, sustaining 
the 14% growth achieved in 2016 (31% proficiency). Math proficiency levels increased from 23% in 2016 to 26% of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

students in 2017. In both assessments, there was growth in the number of students who scored at proficiency levels 
in all subgroups, as compared to the 2016 Assessment data.  

A comparison was made between the percent of early-released 2018 Met/Not Met scores and this data suggests that 
ELA gains were maintained (with no additional increase) and Math scores rose slightly (1.7 percentage points) from 
2017 to. 2018.  

In addition, data was analyzed based on our 2017-18 S/CEP goal for Rigorous Instruction in which we stated that "all 
teachers will implement effective mathematical problem solving instructional plan for students resulting in 25% of 
students in Grades 4-5 increasing one performance level." As a result of introducing the SOLVE framework for 
mathematical problem solving, we saw that, on average, 4th and 5th grade students achieved an increase of two 
performance levels as measured by the pre and post problem solving grade-level assessments. 

Most importantly, as a result of continued gains in Rigorous Instruction and Student Learning, P.S. 82 was no longer 
considered a Focus School and is in good standing! 

Needs-  

According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, only 47% of teachers noted that students respond to challenging test 
questions and in challenging questions raised in class. In addition, 40% of teachers report that students build on each 
others' ideas during class discussions and only 49% say that students used data or text references to support their 
ideas. Lastly, 40% of teachers say that students provide constructive feedback to their peers and teachers. 

According to the Quality Review, it was noted that a few students were not fully aware of how to use supports that 
they are given. In addition, while there is a Math problem solving protocol, not all teachers follow the protocol as 
intended.  

As per the 2017-18 PPO Feedback report, it was reported that scaffolds were present during instruction time, 
however, access to resources could be more strategic. Teachers need more time to discuss delivery on instruction, 
focusing on which strategies to utilize, when to use these strategies, and determine which students need to receive 
specific strategies. Teachers also need to plan for clarifying student misconceptions that can impede learning.  

The PPO Feedback report also noted that teacher's' instructional delivery can be strengthened by enhancing student 
ownership. Teachers need to spend more time to build/incorporate conceptual understanding in their lessons, 
primarily in Mathematics. Teachers and students can consider using video resources to help build conceptual 
knowledge (Khan Academy, GOMath!). Teachers should ensure to monitor student's conceptual understanding, 
provide feedback, and plan lessons strategically based on students' needs -- all with the purposed of enhancing 
student ownership.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all teachers and students of Grades 1-5 will deepen their conceptual understanding of mathematics 
resulting in 50% of students increasing one performance level on a pre- and post-assessment.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

National Training Network (NTN) Math Consultants will be 
employed to facilitate Math Professional Development among 
classroom teachers with the stated goal of building capacity in 
the conceptual underpinning of mathematics instruction. 

-Grade-level horizontal teams will utilize new curriculum maps, 
developed in conjunction with NTN, that reflect a well thought 
out sequence of learning and provide adequate time for 
conceptual understanding of mathematical concepts and hands-
on exploration.  

-Grade-level teams will continue the work of revising unit 
assessments to be more aligned of the rigorous demands of the 
Common Core Learning Standards, including conceptual 
understanding and problem solving. The assessments would be 
aligned to the revised curriculum map based on NTN input.  

-Pre and Post Assessments will be administered and analyzed to 
examine instructional gap areas to determine goals. 

-Test Sophistication questions will be spiraled weekly, and 
included in unit assessments, in order to ensure challenging 
questioning for all students. 

-The SOLVE framework would be implemented across all 
classrooms in order to assist students in the application of 
critical thinking during problem solving. Teachers will roll-out the 
SOLVE protocol starting at the beginning of the year for all 
students. Students will utilize SOLVE in small groups, utilizing a 
checklist (Grades K-2) and/or a rubric (Grades 3-5). 

- All mathematics classrooms will utilize the NTN-developed 
"Fact Masters" protocol to help develop mathematical 
computational fluency for all four mathematical operations 
(dependent on grade level). Specially designed materials will 
support this initiative and progress monitoring of all students will 
be conducted and analyzed to support optimization for 
individual students.

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
The 2017-18 School Quality Guide (including the 2017-18 School Survey and the 2017 Quality Review Report) and the 
2017-18 PPO Written Feedback Report were analyzed to determine areas of strengths and areas for improvement in 
terms of Supportive Environment.. 

Strengths: 

According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, 100% of teachers reported that students are safe in their classes and 
97% teachers reported that students are safe in the hallways, bathrooms, and cafeteria within the school. 
Furthermore, 74% of teachers felt that students are safe traveling between home and school. In terms of social-
emotional measures as noted in the School Quality Guide, 88% of teachers felt that adults in the school help students 
develop the skills they need to complete challenging coursework despite obstacles and 86% of teachers report that 
adults in the school tell their students they believe they can achieve high academic standards. According to the 
Survey, 90% of teachers say that the adults within the school teach critical thinking skills to students. It was also 
reported by 90% of teachers that students feel that it is important to come to school every day. 

According to the 2017 Quality Review Report, the school received a measure of "well developed" for safe and 
inclusive environment (score 4.99) and communication of high expectations for students and staff (score 4.99). 
Support for high expectations include data analysis for all students to determine strengths and obstacles, RTI training, 
and resources for students and families.  

PPO Written Feedback reported that the principal "consistently communicate[s] high expectations through 
professional learning that aligns with the Danielson Framework for Teaching rubric, and the expectations of the CCLS, 
which has resulted with a culture of mutual accountability among all staff." The rubric details how high expectations 
are evident based "unified set of expectations in using the checklist, rubric, effective feedback, and guidance, to 
ensure that all students, including ELLs and SWDs, own their educational experience and are prepared for their next 
level of learning."  

Needs: 

According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, 53% of teachers report that students behave well even when their 
teacher isn't watching and 53% of teachers say that students listen carefully when directions. The report noted that 
60% of teachers found that students pay attention when they are supposed to. In terms of social-emotional learning, 
64% of teachers say that adults at their school have access to school-based supports to assist in behavioral and 
emotional escalations.  

According to the 2017-18 Principal Performance Observation Written Report, it was noted that "strengthening 
teachers' instructional delivery can be strengthened along with student ownership of their next step." It was noted 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19 

 

that targeted teacher feedback will lead to "student ownership of where they are, where they are supposed to be and 
how they can move along the learning continuum." 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

-The school will continue and expand upon the PBIS system that 
was introduced in the 2016-17 school year. Year I of the program 
included a behavior matrix to guide student behavior throughout 
the day (hallways, lunchroom, recess, classrooms). The program 
featured a logo and mascot (Go Lions!) and provided "paw 
passes" for appropriate behavior that can be used to purchase 
reward items at a school store. Teachers and staff are provided a 
supply of Paw Passes weekly for distribution. 

-Year II of the program included a "Social-Emotional Character 
Education Overlay" to guide appropriate student behavior. Key 
"virtues" were introduced monthly to the students - such as 
honesty, responsibility, etc. Students were rewarded with PBIS 
"paw passes" when demonstrating key virtuous behaviors. 
Additionally, award assemblies were held three times a year to 
acknowledge students who clearly demonstrated virtuous 
behavior. 

-Year III of the program -- introduced in the 2017-18 school year -
- featured the creation of the Student Government/Council. The 
school hosted school-wide elections, featuring a debate by the 
candidates, in order to elect Student Representatives The 
Student Council worked with the WE Organization to direct 
charitable activities as decided by Student Representatives.  

The Student Government will have monthly cabinet meetings 
with Administration. Agendas for the months will include:

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The 2017-18 School Quality Guide (including the 2017-18 School Survey and the 2017 Quality Review Report) and the 
2017-18 PPO Written Feedback Report were analyzed to determine areas of strengths and areas for improvement in 
terms of Collaborative Teachers. 

Strengths: 

According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide (School Survey measures), 93% of teachers say that they "design 
appropriate instruction that is matched to students' needs" including English Language Learners and Students with 
Disabilities. In addition, 89% of teachers report that they utilize their "students' prior knowledge to make their lessons 
relevant to their everyday life." In terms of peer collaboration, 95% of teachers report that "they talk with one 
another about instruction" and 81% of teachers noted that they "design instructional programs together" which 
includes lessons and units. According to the School Survey, 77% of teachers report that they had opportunities to 
"work productively with colleagues at their school on professional development." 

In terms of the 2017 Quality Review, the school received a well-developed rating (score - 4.99) for teacher 
development and evaluation. In terms of Teacher Teams and Leadership Development, the Quality review report 
noted that "distributed leadership roles are embedded in many beliefs conveyed by the principal and in structures 
throughout the school culture." Furthermore, on all vertical teams, teachers have some leadership roles and 
participate in conversations connecting professional development to supporting school improvement" and "all staff 
are engaged in inquiry-based collaborations that meet regularly."  

The 2017-18 PPO Written Feedback report, "teachers were seen collaborating well with their colleagues and student-
teacher conversations were positive." It was noted that "teachers engaged in structured inquiry based professional 
collaborations, developing and discussing their strategies on how to meet student entry points." The report indicated 
that teacher teams systematically analyze data and that distributed leadership structures are embedded, and that 
teachers have taken ownership of their work. 

Needs: 

According to the 2017-18 School Survey, a reported 57% of teachers say that "the principal, teachers, and staff 
collaborate to make the school run effectively" and and 59% report that their professional development experiences 
"have included enough time to think carefully about, try, and evaluate new ideas." Measures in the realm of school 
commitment include "34% of teachers would recommend their school to other teachers" and 41% report that they 
"usually look forward to each working day." According to the Quality Review Report, while distributed leadership 
roles are embedded, "the staff is relatively inexperienced [so] school leadership limits the full scope of their ability to 
be more independent until student achievement growth on standardized assessments is achieved on a regular basis."  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          26 

 

The 2017-18 PPO Written Feedback report indicated that "strengthening teachers' instructional delivery can be 
strengthened" including "teachers to discuss delivery of instruction: Which strategies should be used? When to use it? 
"With whom should the strategies be applied to?"  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, all teacher teams will engage in 1-3 inter-class visitations within their respective grade bands (K-2 and 3-5) 
as measured by the 2018-19 PS82Q Professional Development Plan.

As part of the Professional Development Plan, a schedule will 
be created in which all teacher teams will participate in Inter-
class visitations within their grade bands (K-2 and 3-5). The 
number of visitations (1-3) and the focus will be tailored to 
the individual needs of the teachers involved. 

The Inter-Class Visitation Action Plan will be developed after 
an analysis of teacher pedagogical needs and will be 
comprised of three parts: 1. Establishment of focus, 2. Visit, 
and 3. Debrief. 

Teachers share their lesson plans, resources and unit plans 
via our school website, as a way to share best practices, 
provide transparency and build coherence amongst grades. 

Teachers on every grade are provided a common prep every 
day within the week in an effort to allow them to collaborate 
and engage in the cycle of learning "PIRAS". Plan lessons, 
Implement Lessons, Review and Adjust Lessons and Share

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The 2017-18 School Quality Guide (including the 2017-18 School Survey and the 2017 Quality Review Report) and the 
2017-18 PPO Written Feedback Report were analyzed to determine areas of strengths and areas for improvement. 

Strengths:  

According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, Effective School Leadership scores were consistent versus previous 
year (Framework Element Scores - 3.40). In terms of Inclusive leadership, 97% of families say that the principal 
promotes family and community involvement in the school and 94% of families say that the principal is strongly 
committed to shared decision making. In terms of Instructional Leadership, 80% of teachers say that the principal 
makes clear to the staff the expectations for meeting instructional goals.  

With regards to the 2016-17 Quality Review, the Area of Celebration in which the school received a well developed 
rating was for making "strategic organizational decisions to support the school's instructional goals and meet student 
learning needs, as evidence by meaningful student work products" (quality indicator 1.3- leveraging resources). As 
noted, "organizational decisions, including the use of staff, teacher time, and purchased resources, are well aligned 
and support the school's instructional goals." Furthermore the report indicated that, "Distributed leadership 
structures exist among staff members including roles supporting data analysis and professional development." In 
addition, the school received a well-developed rating for quality indicator 3.4 - high expectations, in that "school 
leaders consistently communicate high expectations to the entire staff, for example, through data meetings or 
Response to Intervention (RTI) training." A well-developed rating was also received for "how well does the school 
identify, track, and meet its goals" (quality indicator 3.1). The report also indicates that 95% of families say that they 
trust the principal. 

The 2017-18 PPO Written Feedback Report supported Indicator 1.4 as an Area of Celebration, which is a "culture of 
mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the academic and personal growth of students and adults." As noted 
in the report, "teachers were seen collaborating well with their colleagues and student-teacher conversations were 
positive. Teachers participated and coordinated school events to build a positive culture." In addition, in support of 
Quality Indicator 1.3, "Levels 1, 2, and low level 3 performing students were provided with intervention. High level 3 
and 4 students received an enrichment program to extend their learning."  

Needs: 

According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, 23% of teachers say that they have influence over the selection of 
instructional materials used in classrooms and 34% of teachers reported that they have influence over the 
development of instructional materials. The report indicates that 42% of teachers say that it is clear how all of the 
programs offered are connected to their school's instructional focus. Additional 34% of teachers indicated that the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          31 

 

principal knows what's going on in their classroom and 38% of teachers say that the principal understands how 
children learn. The report indicated that 34% of teachers say that they trust the principal. 

The 2016-17 Quality Review Report indicated that "the role teachers play in making key decisions that affect student 
learning is emerging." As noted, "the staff is relatively inexperienced, school leadership limits the full scope of their 
ability to be more independent until student achievement growth on standardized assessments is achieved on a 
regular basis." 

The 2017-18 Principal Performance Observation (PPO) report indicates that a "focus on strengthening teachers' 
instructional delivery can be strengthened along with student ownership of their next step."  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will participate in high-leverage professional learning to increase questioning/discussion 
techniques, quality of questioning, and student participation, resulting in an overall effective HEDI teacher observation 
rating in component 3B (Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques) of the Danielson Framework for Teaching 
Rubric.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

In an effort to build capacity and distribute leadership, their will 
be teacher leaders on each grade across vertical and horizontal 
teams. 100% of teachers will be involved in a leadership capacity 
within the school and collaboratively engage in decision making 
and planning of curriculum, researched based inquiry and 
building school culture. Administration, along with the 
instructional committee will facilitate lead teacher team 
meetings, in order to share a common language, structures and 
protocols across the school community.  

-Through the leadership of administration, teacher teams will 
analyze assessment data, trends and use protocols to look at 
student work, to identify Common Core aligned learning targets, 
aimed at enhancing teacher pedagogy and improving student 
achievement. Through the cycle of Learning and established 
benchmarks, administrators will monitor student/teacher 
progress towards determined goals. Teacher teams will analyze 
data, develop exploratory questions and engage in the inquiry of 
research based strategies to fill in instructional gaps.  

-Professional Learning will be focused on such topics as research-
based discussion strategies, increasing student engagement 
through questioning and discussion techniques, utilizing targeted 
test-based questioning in instruction, and student-guided 
discussion. 

Cycles of Informal and Formal Observations will be followed in 
an effort to monitor student learning and teacher pedagogy. 
Specific feedback will be given to teachers and differentiated 
supports will be provided. Some of the supports which will be 
provided to teachers are: scheduled inter-class visitations, 
modeled lessons by our staff developer, hired consultants and 
colleagues. Lab sites will be arranged for study groups, in-house 
and outside on-going professional development will be 
strategically developed through a professional development 
plan. Differentiated improvement plans will be aimed at 
supporting individual teacher needs.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

The 2017-18 School Quality Guide (including the 2017-18 School Survey and the 2017 Quality Review Report) and the 
2017-18 PPO Written Feedback Report were analyzed to determine areas of strengths and areas for improvement. 
These findings as related to Family-Community Ties are as follows:  

Strengths: 

According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, 95% of families say that school staff regularly communicate with them 
about how families can help their children learn. In addition, 94% of families say that they get opportunities to visit 
their child's classroom, such as observing instruction or participating in an activity with their child and 96% of parents 
say that they feel well informed by the communications they receive from their school. The report indicated that 96% 
of teachers say that teachers work closely with families to meet student needs. 

In terms of the 2017 Quality Review, the school received a well-developed rating for quality indicator 3.4, in how 
"does the school partner with families to support student success." The report noted that, "families of students were 
made fully aware of their children's progress through a variety of communications." This includes newsletters, online 
resources, parent workshops, and progress updates. 

Needs: 

According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, 66% of families report that they have had the opportunity to 
volunteer time to support their school. As indicated in the 2017-18 PPO Written Feedback, approximately 16% of 
students have less than 90% attendance in the 2016-17 school year. The report further noted, "Consider meeting 
parents and students personally to set attendance goals, in which a small poster, including the number of absence 
days agreed upon is visible, so it can be checked off to monitor their attendance. Incentives can also be used as 
motivation.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Administrators regularly attend hiring fairs to identify and recruit highly-qualified teachers. Administration attends job 
fairs and interviews candidates based on the curriculum currently in place. Additionally, the Administrators work 
closely with New Teacher Finder in order to seek those candidates that are highly qualified. Our school developed 
student-teacher partnerships with various local universities which enables us to hire those candidates who will 
transition easily to our school community. 

Newly hired teachers are provided mentors for the first years. Mentors are experienced highly qualified teachers that 
meet at scheduled times to provide guidance and support. Teachers are observed by administration to ensure quality 
instruction is on-going and provided with timely actionable feedback. Meetings are held on grade bands and whole 
school to ensure continuous knowledge of learning is shared. Administration reviews the strengths and weaknesses of 
pedagogues in order to inform decisions as to the best instructional assignments for each school year. 

Teachers are afforded opportunities for professional development devoted to meeting their assessed pedagogical 
needs and interest Through teacher surveys, grade discussions and teacher suggestions/ideas focused professional 
development is provided. Coaches, Network Specialist and administrators provide: Lesson demonstration; strategies 
for scaffolding/differentiating lessons; individual teacher support in analyzing student work and deciphering the 
Common Core Learning Standards; common planning time with the grade members; vertical and horizontal teacher 
team meetings, instructional materials and resources. Professional development from outside consultants and 
Borough Field Specialist also assists in supporting teacher growth. Funding is allocated to ensure that teachers are 
provided with all materials and resources to be effective pedagogues.

and math cohorts. Teacher leads are established for all content areas, and these leads are sent out to on-going 
professional development. Teacher leads turnkey professional development to their teacher teams. Principal 
meetings provided by the Borough Field Support Center (BFSC) will be used to guide school wide expectations and in-
house professional development. The BFSC has created a paraprofessional cohort and crisis paraprofessional 
professional development series. Time is allocated to support cohort members to turnkey information to the entire 
staff. Funding is provided to cover classes not only of the cohort members but for any teacher that has actively sought 
professional development outside of that which is provided by the Network and school. Teachers are provided with 
the opportunity to voice their concerns, ideas and opinions during professional development, in meetings or through

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS82, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary 
and Secondary (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the 
connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed 
to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of 
their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and 
Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS82 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events;

activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

 

 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

PS 82 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

After School Program: 
 
After analyzing the ELL data using the ELL data analysis tool, I noticed that several of my 
English Language Learners are struggling in Math and ELA, scoring levels 1 and 2 on state 
assessments. The purpose of the supplemental instructional after school program is to support 
students in attaining English proficiency through content. Using the Title III LEP allocation, I am 
able to service most of my English Language Learners during either my  after school and 
Saturday academy programs. During the after school program, in alternate weeks students in 
grade level 3-5 will participate in  ELA and Math classes which use ENL strategies. . The 
supplemental instructional program targets students at the entering, emerging, transitioning, and 
expanding English proficiency levels. A limited number of commanding ELLs who have 
attained proficiency within the past two years and have been targeted as needing additional 
support are also included in the student selection so that continued support can be provided to 
them as well. Students are selected for the after school program based on the results of the 
NYSITELL, NYSESLAT and NYS ELA/Math assessments. In addition, we use Fountas and 
Pinnell diagnostic reading assessments in English and Spanish, as well as student work products 
to further enhance our student selection. 
 
 
The structure of the after school program will be as follows: There will be two classes per grade, 
with approximately 15 students per class. The language of instruction is English for those 
students that have a variety of home languages and are part of the English as a New Language 
program.  The after school program will run from December, 2018 to April, and 2019. Students 
will receive a total of four hours of targeted instruction a week.  Classes will be held every 
Wednesday and Thursday. The ENL Instructional Coach will provide teachers with ENL 
strategies and scaffolds to incorporate into their lessons.  
To ensure that instruction is based on quantitative and qualitative data, teachers will participate 
in professional development engaging in how to use data to effectively inform instruction. The 
supplementary instructional program promotes the improvement of fluency and all other aspects 
of reading, writing, listening and speaking which are required for ELL students to meet and 
exceed the New York State performance-based ELA/Math assessments, as well as 
the ENL/Bilingual Progressions.  Saturday Academy: 
 
Taking into consideration the ELA NYS Assessment scores, NYSITEL and NYSESLAT 
assessment data, we have decided to focus on reading and writing, reinforcing the four 
modalities (reading, writing, listening and speaking). The purpose of the Saturday Academy is to 
provide students with the necessary strategies/skills to become strong readers and writers as they 
attain English proficiency. Teachers use research based instructional methodologies to ensure 
students’ academic and language acquisition needs are met. The ENL/Bilingual  and Common 
Branch teachers carefully plan lessons based on student’s sumative and formative assessments to

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
provide targeted instruction/interventions that provide students’ with a variety of literacy based 
activities. There is an instructional rotation embedded in the schedule which allows for the 
integration of the arts and technology. Students use art to express themselves and technology to 
develop their reading and oral language, using Imagine Learning.  Through the Arts, we engage 
our ELLs in meaningful instructional activities,  targeting various learning styles and language 
proficiencies. Some of these activities include the creation of self portraits and different images 
to express themselves. Students will produce an array of art pieces modeling famous artists such 
as Paul Klee, Picasso, Seurat. 
 
This year our  Saturday academy is being offered to all Transitioning and some Expanding 
English Language Learners, not including Commanding ELLs. We have made a very conscious 
decision to open this academy to our Transitioning ELLs based on the data, and the noticing of 
little movement from Transitioning to Expanding on NYSESLAT. Parents are involved in at 
least half hour of direct classroom instruction provided to students. At P.S.82Q we view parents 
as partners in education. During the first half hour of the Saturday Academy, parents sit in their 
child’s class to familiarize themselves with the skills, and strategies being taught to their child. 
Parents are able to participate in the lessons with their children.  
 
The structure of the Saturday Academy will be as follows:  There will be one class per grade, 
with approximately 20 students per class. The language of instruction is English for those 
students that have a variety of home languages and are part of the English as a New Language 
program.  For students registered in the transitional bilingual program, who have a home 
language of Spanish and have an English proficiency level of entering and emerging, we will 
provide Home Language instruction as needed. The Saturday Academy will run from November 
2018 - May 2019. Students will receive a total of three hours of targeted instruction a 
week.  Classes are held every Saturday, excluding holiday weekends. We provide breakfast and 
hot lunch for both students and parents. 
 
There will be five dually certified teachers and one common branch teacher providing targeted 
instruction to English Language Learners during the Saturday Academy. 
 
The supplementary instructional program promotes the improvement of fluency and all other 
aspects of reading, writing, listening and speaking which are required for ELL students to meet 
and exceed the New York State performance-based ELA Standards as well as the ENL/Bilingual 
Language Progressions. 
 
The instructional materials that will be utilized in the Saturday Academy are researched based 
materials generated through Attanasio & Associates Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT as well 
as Read Alouds connected to the Arts Instruction and Imagine Learning, as a 
technological resource.. The instructional materials that will be utilized in the after school 
program are researched based materials designed for language development and academic 
support. Materials include ELA and Math skill books from Ready, leveled ELL readers, home 
language support literature, Imagine Learning, as well as the book Reading Strategies  to support 
teachers in developing core lessons. Teachers will also assign students task on My-on and 
Imagine Learnign,, which will incorporate the use of technology. Through the smart board, 
students will be provided visual representations to build academic vocabulary, back ground 
knowledge and support their language development.  
There will be a culminating family trip to an art museum, so that both students and parents can 
be exposed to the art work of some of the artist they learn abut throughout the program. We hope 
to broaden students exposure to the arts, make real world connections and provide time for 
family engagement.

Begin description here:            
 The purpose for providing professional development to teachers who are instructing students in 
the After School and Saturday program is to ensure that teachers provide our students with the 
highest quality of instruction. Additionally, providing professional development creates 
consistent and effective pedagogical techniques and teacher moves, tailored to address the needs 
of the our English Language Learners. We focus on providing teachers guidance on how to 
address the different modalities.  
All teachers who work these programs and any teacher who has ELLs in their class, is provided 
intense professional development on multi-lingual learners and how to effectively plan for 
instruction to meet their various academic and language needs. Teachers are provided 
professional development throughout the year, in various forms and with different facilitators. 
We have an ENL Instructional coach who provides teachers with ELL specific professional 
learning sessions during the day, as well as on Mondays during Professional Development  time. 
We have a consultant from Educational Consortium who is an ELL expert and works with 
teachers once a month, providing them with all day professional development. Staff members 
will register to attend ongoing workshop sessions offered by the Division of English Language 
Learners and Student Support, and then turn-key the information to staff.         
Professional development topics specific to ELLs will include: differentiation of small group 
activities including writing, creating scaffolding opportunities during lesson executions; text 
complexity for ELLs, building vocabulary and the use of graphic organizers to build reading 
comprehension. Guided reading, using NYSESLAT data to identify student needs and support 
them in the different modalities. Scaffolds to support ELLs in the writing process. Creating 
language objectives which support our learning objctive.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
P.S. 82 believes in engaging parents in the teaching and learning process. It is our mission to 
build home/school partnerships that will support student learning at home thus promoting student 
success. 
Administration and teachers work closely with the Parent Coordinator to inform parents of the 
various programs offered in the school for both students and parents. All parents are invited to an 
information sharing meeting before the start of the ELL Supplemental Program. Notices for 
meetings and events are sent to parents in English with Spanish translation from staff 
(approximately 58% of the student population are Spanish or students whose home language is 
Spanish) and the other languages are translated by using the Translation and Interpretation Unit. 
In order to ensure parents understand the information fully, we have translators available in the 
first language of our largest population of parents. This includes fluent Spanish and Bengali 
speaking staff. During this orientation meeting, parents are given information about the program, 
its duration and purpose. Parents are informed of the ELL identification process and the choices 
they have for their children.  
 
On a monthly basis, we offer parent workshops on various topics and we always have a 
translator available. Some of the topics covered are: Supporting your child in Literacy and Math. 
How to deal with Bullying, Making the right financial decisions to secure your future and 
finances. Strategies to support Children with Learning Disabilities, How to Prepare your Child 
for the NYSESLAT.  
In addition to providing parents with workshops, we also provide them many opportunities to 
engage in academic and engaging activities with their children. Some of the activities we have 
for both students and parents to participate in are: Dad Take Your Child to School Day, Math 
Night, Literacy Night, Spelling Bee, Someone special Dance, Come Learn With Me Sessions.  
We also offer classes in the evening for any parent who is interested in learning the English 
language. Classes are offered three days a week from 6:000 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. All parents of 
students who attend our Saturday Academy will be provided a series of workshops which will 
be  facilitated by one of our certified bilingual teachers. Parents will be provided resources such 
as books, dictionaries and participate in make and take activities.  
Ongoing Literacy/Math workshops are provided for parents as well as the Administration 
providing instructional time to parents during the monthly PTA meetings. At this time, parents 
are exposed to various literacy strategies and Parent Read Alouds. Parents are encouraged to use 
suggested strategy packets (How Can I Help My child At Home?) to work with students to 
improve their academic achievement. Teachers send home books in the student's Native 
Language. Parents are encouraged to utilize the virtual resources purchased by the school which 
can be accessed via the internet. These include MyOnReader and Pebblego for literacy, IXL for 
math and Brainpop for both literacy and the content areas.  
This year our ENL Teacher Team is providing information sessions for parents throughout the 
year, to keep them abreast of their child's language proficiency and progress. We have also 
scheduled three parent workshops for each vertical teacher team to conduct for parents during 
parent engagement time, as well as cluster program teachers.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Early literacy skills assessments utilized for the ELL students include but are not limited to the following: ReadyGen Reading 
assessments, Ready assessment, Fundations Assessments, mock NYSESALT exams, teacher-made assessments, Fountas and 
Pinnell running records and observational/conference note taking. The data received from these diagnostic tools are used to 
assess the degree of language the student possesses, the areas that need to be strengthened and the method appropriate to 
meet that specific need.  The results of the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT are used when reviewing and analyzing data to target 
specific students’ needs. Additionally, with the NYSESLAT, second language stall can be recognized early and interventions put 
into place. Student progress can be monitored and tracked using these assessment instruments.   Through data analysis and 
progress monitoring, we have been able to select our school-wide instructional focus " Students will become fluent readers 
with increased vocabulary and comprehension skills" Teachers use this data to drive their small group targeted and guided

reading instruction. Students are selected for Saturday and After School literacy programs,  based on the needs identified on 
these assessments.      
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The master schedule is aligned with ENL and RTI providers to support literacy instruction, data is analyzed  using  the 
assessments above to provide targeted instruction.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of the ELL students is monitored and tracked with increases in growth utilizing the NYSESLAT, state assessments, 
reading/math unit assessments, class work, Fundations assessments,  informal observations of student participation, Ready, I-
Ready mock assessments,  and teacher-made assessments.     
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered students are scheduled for one or more of the following interventions: RTI, 
SPIRE, Saturday Academy, Reading & Math After School. Interventionist use the data to provide targeted instruction. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
ELL's are assessed during the intake process. In addition to completing the Home Language survey/interview students are also 
assessed using the Fountas & Pinnell in both English and Spanish if applicable as well as a beginning of the year math 
assessment. For Tier I the teacher incorporates specific strategies and in class interventions for those ELL students that 
demonstrate a need for extended intervention. If further intervention is necessary the students are then referred for Tier II 
intervention. The students are given an assessment to ensure intervention provided will meet the students' needs. The 
students are then incorporated in the Tier II schedule while still receiving in class Tier I intervention. If Tier III intervention is 
considered the students' are referred to the RTI committee for assessment and the student is referred to the SBST team if this 
is deemed necessary.   ESL teachers provide push in services to ELLs and work with them in groups according to levels and 
needs identified. ESL, RTI and Classroom teachers meet weekly to plan instruction and strategies for co-teaching to meet the 
individual needs of our English Language Learners.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The assessments used are NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, ELA/Math State Assessments, along with mock assessments and any classroom 
formative/summative assessments. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 Google drive and Google docs are used to capture data, the school community has access to all classroom and school wide 
data. All New York State Assessment data is analyzed and shared at grade, vertical and school wide meetings. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

The instruction for the ENL students in a free-standing program is delivered through a stand-alone and integrated ENL 
model. The program models are blocked homogeneous for ENLs. The proficiency levels are mixed in both models, but 
ELLs are placed in classes based on the number of integrated ENL hours of instruction they require. In grades where 
we have dually certified teachers, most ELLs are placed in the same class and receive services by their classroom 
teacher. In certain circumstances we arrange to have students join another classroom on their grade during literacy, 
so that they can be serviced by our out of classroom ENL teacher. In an effort to allow coherence in instruction, all 
classes on each grade teach the same subjects at the same time. Time for pull out service is incorporated in all ENL 
teachers schedules and there is an ENL classroom dedicated for this instruction. The ENL classroom filled with books, 
dictionaries, thesaurus and other materials which teachers can utilize to support their English Language Learners.  The 
methods and approaches that are utilized include Total Physical Response (TPR), Read Aloud/Think Aloud/Talk Aloud 
(RA-TA-TA), Sheltered English, Academic Language Development, Multiple Meanings and Minimal Pair Practice to 
name a few of the many methods and approaches used.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

PS82 has three transitional bilingual classes. One Kindergarten, one first grade, and one second grade class. Here the 
students' proficiency levels are mixed.    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    
not applicable to our school 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Programs are carefully designed to ensure that all ENL students receive the appropriate units of instruction as mandated by CR 
Part 154.  The administrative cabinet designs the schedules of all ENL teachers.     
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Academic language development at each level must be planned in alignment with the core curriculum content and the 
Common Core Learning Standards. This planning is collaborative. That is, classroom teachers, ENL teachers and related service 
providers all share and revise unit plans on a regular basis. Familiarity with the curriculum is an essential factor in tailoring 
instruction to meet students' needs. For example, knowing that students in a particular grade will be learning to calculate 
percents and convert them to decimals will be important to guiding the development of academic language for that student. In 
each program model Transitional Bilingual and Free Standing ENL Instruction, instruction for ELLs is differentiated utilizing a 
variety of teaching methods and activities. These include guided reading through the use of Scholastic Short Reads 
Passages, visual (graphic organizers, flashcards, word walls), auditory (songs, chants, oral drills, storytelling), kinesthetic 
(movement in learning language, board games, hands-on activities) and tactile (card games, use of manipulative, board games, 
Promethean/Smart boards) and literature in students’ first language. Instructional materials used for the ELL students include 
ReadyGen Reading Program, Leveled Literacy Intervention,  Fundations, Wilson, Imagine Learning software, MYON, videos, 
CDs and educational games. Technology is used to help support language acquisition. We have MacBook's accessible for all 
grades to engage in interactive learning activities. 
 
The ENL teachers collaborate with the general education classroom teachers so that the unit's enduring understanding, weekly 
focused reading skill and focused reading strategy being taught during reading in the general education classrooms with the 
advanced students is being taught in the ENL classroom with the necessary scaffolds. Materials utilized for Ells include 
ReadyGen ELL Strategy, leveled ELL libraries, leveled ELL readers, bilingual books, bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, MYON, 
Reading A-Z. ELL materials are utilized using ELL strategies. These include, chucking text, demystifying the English language, 
lifting text, letter/sound/word/picture connections, talking around text and echo reading. Marrying both content and language 
is an integral component of teaching English Language Learners. Push-in ENL teachers during content  area instruction and 
mainstream teachers will use cues and questioning techniques. This will be used before a lesson begins in order to  activate 
background knowledge and to help ELLs focus on what they will be learning. This will include the use of of explicit cues to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

access prior knowledge, ask questions that elicit inferences and the use of analytic questions. Advance organizers will also be 
used to help students understand key concepts that they will be exposed to as they learn a new concept. For example, when 
webs or a Venn diagram are used as advanced organizers, ELLs can see connections between concepts, words or phrases that 
explain the central ideas(s) being studied. Research by Jimenez (2000) and Galindo (1993) indicates that ELLs benefit from 
literacy development experiences that are  related  to their bilingual abilities and their bilingual status. Therefore, the 
aforementioned will also be used in our TBE program during the science and/or social studies block to help students 
negotiate  meaning in their native language. 
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

 
 
P.S. 82Q endeavors to ensure that students are appropriately evaluated in their native language. The Fountas and 
Pinelle assessment has bee purchased in both English and Spanish so that teachers are able to identify students independent 
reading level in both their native language and English. All emerging and entering students have access version to all math text 
and assessments. All other ELLs have access to glossaries for all math and science assessments. We have on staff DOE 
employees that speak Spanish and Bengali. If a staff member is not available, we request a native language speaker from the 
DOE Department of Translation. The school has four benchmarking periods throughout the year. Fountas and Pinnell Running 
Records for reading levels and the use of Fundations, ReadyGen, and Harcourt Math In Focus (Harcourt), Leveled Spanish texts 
are used for small group reading. The school also utilizes bilingual texts, dictionaries and glossaries.   
 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a-P.S. 82Q seeks to provide services for SIFE students beyond the requirements of the ESL program. Students are targeted 
for assistance in literacy, math and content areas as needed. This assistance is usually in the form of small group 
differentiated instruction to supplement the whole class instruction of the literacy and math blocks. Formal and informal 
assessments help identify areas of strength and weakness and this information is used to inform supplementary instruction. 
Students are targeted for the Title III Saturday program as well. Literature in students’ first language is available and provided 
to assist students in bridging their gap of interrupted formal learning. 
 
b-In order to support the needs of ELL students with less than three years in an ENL program and to support those students 
that are required to be tested according to NCLB legislation, P.S. 82 identifies these students early in the school year to give 
them extra instructional support. The students that meet these requirements based on U.S. admission dates, school 
experience, home language 
survey, and classroom and ENL teachers’ recommendation, are selected for additional support during the school day in the 
form of in-class differentiated instruction, pull-out support with the Tier II academic intervention providers, after school 
academic intervention support and one-on-one instruction with both in-class and out of classroom teachers.   
c-These students are monitored, tracked and evaluated for specific learning need. They are placed in small group 
differentiated instruction using ENL recommended methods and activities. Literature in the students’ first language is 
provided. Students are included in the Title III After School supplementary program as well as any Tier III support services.  
d-These students are given literacy and math instruction by specialists in small instructional groups. We work in conjunction 
with families to provide the maximum support for students. Should a student continue to fail to make adequate progress, 
other diagnostic measures may be recommended to see if the student requires specialized academic intervention or other 
services.  
e-Every effort is made to ensure that students are evaluated to determine whether a student’s need is associated with a 
learning disability and not language. When an evaluation by the SBST is made, it includes a determination whether or not an 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

alternative placement language paraprofessional is appropriate. At present, we have five students in self-contained special 
education classes who receive the service of a bilingual alternative placement paraprofessional (Spanish and Bengali). 
Additionally data is collected from students’ IEPs in order to facilitate and foster language acquisition and academic learning as 
the ENL teachers work closely with the special education teachers.   
f- All English language learners and Immigrant students and their families in Grades K-5 are invited to attend our ENL Saturday 
Academy. In this Academy, students receive grade level instruction aligned to the four modalities of the NYSESLAT exam. 
Parents join their children for a half our of family bonding by having breakfast together. Parents then go to class with their 
child to collaboratively learn for a half hour. Parents are then escorted to the library where they receive instruction by a 
former ESL College Instructor, providing them strategies to help their child build language, academic and social skills. Families 
are then joined for lunch. There is a large amount of parent and student participation in this academy.  
 
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers are provided with ENL/SWD scaffold handbooks for Reading/Math and Writing. The ENL vertical team with the 
assistance of Education Consortium have developed English language note slips for every reading content area. Teachers are 
given research based materials (Harcourt Go Math, ReadyGen, Fundations, Wilson, Imagine Learning, MYON) that include 
techniques for scaffolding instruction, increasing visuals in the lesson execution, using tactile materials and incorporating 
technology specific to ELL students to name a few.   
   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our curriculum is based on that which is set by the New York State/City Department of Education. P.S. 82Q provides scheduling 
that  includes small group pull-out, small group push-in, teacher led small groups, after school and Saturday instructional 
programs in an effort to meet the needs of the ELL students.    
           
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Supplementary instructional programs during the school day include Fundations, Wilson, Fountas & Pinnell Leveled Literacy 
Intervention, SPIRE, Imagine Learning and MYON.  These programs are used by reading specialists as a means of early 
intervention with at risk students including students from our ENL population.  These are also research-based programs that 
meet the six criteria for effective reading instruction and allow teachers to differentiate their instruction to meet the reading, 
writing, listening and speaking needs of the ENL students. Additionally, it provides the necessary resources needed to services 
the targeted ENL students in math and the other content areas. This technique enables students to become independent and 
proficient readers, writers, listeners, and speakers. All instruction, including targeted intervention programs are taught in 
English and through reading and all the content areas.     
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 
As we move into the new school year, some of the considerations are to expand our transitional bilingual education one grade 
level. We will also begin to assess all entering and emerging Ells in both the English and Spanish Fountas and Pinnell running 
record.  We will be purchasing new Spanish libraries for our bilingual grant, which will include authentic Spanish literature and 
Spanish guided reading text. We will also implement a lending library for parents which will be coordinated by our Parent 
Teacher Association and the Parent Coordinator through the use of Title 1 Parent funds. Parents will be allowed to borrow 
books for them in their child that come in both English and their native language.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are provided equal access to ALL school programs/curriculum. Teachers of our ENL and Bilingual classes use the same core 
curriculum as teachers of our monolingual classes. Students work with their peers and with teachers on accessing the 
materials with scaffolds and supports. We provide additional support to ELLs after-school in our AIS ELA and Math program. 
We also have a Saturday Academy which is geared towards education our entire ELL population and their parents. Our Ells are 
also supported through RTI and AIS when their data shows evidence of needing additional supports.  All ELLs are provided 
additional access to Imagine Learning during the school day, to support their academic and language development.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Dual langauge library books have been purchased where students' can compare Spanish and English or Bengali and English side 
by side. MyOn Reader, an online interactive reading program,  has been purchased that reads stories to the students in English 
and Spanish. Vocabulary support is also provided.  The program tracks students' progress. We have purchased 32 licenses for 
Imagine Learning, a program that has been proven to be successful in helping students obtain language acquisition . IXL, an 
interactive math program has been purchased that delivers support in English and Spanish. This program tracks the students' 
progress.  In the classrooms teachers have access to bilingual dictionaries.  We have also purchased licenses for Reading A-Z, 
Raz-Kids, Writing A-Z and Science A-Z to support the small group and AIS instruction of our ELLs.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

PS 82 does not have a dual language program. The transitional bilingual program initially (September)delivers 70% of the 
instruction in the students' native language and over the course of the school year this language support diminishes until 
almost all instruction is delivered in English (70%).   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All instructional material that is used is based on the common core learning  standards. The teachers provide scaffolds using 
the ENL progressions and other scaffolding resources that are age and grade appropriate as they relate to the common core 
learning standards.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Dual langauge library books have been purchased where students' can compare Spanish and English or Bengali and English side 
by side. MyOn Reader, an online interactive reading program,  has been purchased that reads stories to the students in English 
and Spanish. Vocabulary support is also provided.  The program tracks students' progress. We have purchased 32 licenses for 
Imagine Learning, a program that has been proven to be successful in helping students obtain language acquisition . IXL, an 
interactive math program has been purchased that delivers support in English and Spanish. This program tracks the students' 
progress.  In the classrooms teachers have access to bilingual dictionaries.  We have also purchased licenses for Reading A-Z, 
Raz-Kids, Writing A-Z and Science A-Z to support the small group and AIS instruction of our ELLs.    
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled Ells are introduced to the school community by a school representative that is fluent in the language of the 
child (when possible).  Our parent coordinator and guidance counselor both speak fluent Spanish, for example. When in the 
classroom these students are paired with a "buddy" who is fluent in that language. We also have a Saturday Academy which is 
open to all Ells and their families, no matter when they enroll in the school.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All  teachers are provided with professional development held weekly during the Monday 80 minutes of Professional 
Development.  PS 82 has a vertical ENL Teacher Team which comprises of all ENL certified teachers, teachers who have ELL 
students in their classroom, and the Supervisor of ELL instruction. This team meets every other Tuesday during the 
Professional Work period to educate themselves on the new mandates (CR Part 154), Bilingual Progressions, Lesson Planning 
for English Language Learners, Looking at students work, data analysis and supports for ELLs. These teachers and 
administration are all sent out to professional development around English Language Learners provided by the borough Field 
Support Center, and the city. They are then required to turn key this information to the either the entire school community, 
their horizontal teacher team and/or their ENL vertical teacher team. The ENL teacher who provides push in services meets 
with common branch teachers of the classes she services on the other two Tuesdays of the month, to plan for Co-Teaching.  
Additionally P.S. 82Q have common branch staff that are ENL certified and utilize ENL techniques in their classrooms. The 
coach provides ongoing professional development on instructional modifications for ENL students to the common branch 
teachers of ELL students and the ENL certified common branch teachers during the school day. We also have the support of 
Martine Santos, The Director of English Language Learners at our school. Ms. Santos visits the school at least two to three 
times a month, providing classroom support, Professional Development and planning next steps for the school with 
administration. We have an ongoing PD plan which highlight series of professional development offered to teachers 
throughout the year. Teachers attend differentiated PD sessions based on the needs of their students and their pedagogical 
needs. Additionally we have hired an ENL consultant, Dr. Delgado who provides professional development and works with 
small cohorts side by side, and one on one with ENL teachers to provide feedback and help to plan instruction. Cycles of inter-
visitation are scheduled and immediate feedback provided through the coaching model. 
The professional development offered to all teachers in supporting ELLs under the common core learning standards  included 
during the professional development sessions provided by the Borough office, literacy coaches and administration. This PD is 
provided during the 80 minutes of professional development on Mondays at least once a month. Instructional modifications, 
incorporation of ENL strategies, increasing visual aides, chuncking text, and increasing student to student conversations to 
name a few as they move all students to mastery of the common core learning standards are included during the PD 
sessions.  Certain teachers have planning time blocked into their schedule to allow for articulation with teachers supporting 
ELLs,  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Providing time for the ESL teachers to attend ESL professional development given by the ESL Borough Specialist, literacy 
coaches and administration, is built into their schedule. The content of these workshop sessions include skills and strategies for 
strengthening ESL students’ language and academic abilities as they transition from elementary to middle school. Additionally, 
the guidance counselor and parent coordinator attend workshops held by the DOE/middle schools where services for ELL 
students is discussed. Information from these sessions are given to the terminating grade ELL students and parents during PTA 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

 

and information sent home to parents. The ESL teachers turnkey the instructional practice to non-ESL common branch 
teachers to support ongoing instruction of these skills and strategies.  This year we have partnered with Marquis Studios. We 
were granted the funds for third, fourth and fifth graders. We have formed a partnership with Marquis Studios in the 2017/18 
school year established residency programs reaching every student in our school. Teacher leaders from our from our SWD and 
ENL Vertical teams will be actively involved throughout the residency, We will host a planning meeting with Marquis teaching 
artist and SWD and ELL teaching leads to map out program specifics. The teacher leaders will work with Marquis staff to 
address educational goals and make sure each residency is providing a meaningful arts experience for their students. 
As per CR Part 154.2, all teachers in the building receive in-school training from our ENL teachers and teachers of ELLs during 
grade level and/or monthly school meetings. ENL teachers (all teachers) attend workshops from the Borough Field Support 
Center and Office of English Language Learners and then turnkey the information to the rest of the staff, around best practices 
for teaching literacy, building academic vocabulary and language development strategies.Teachers also attend PD on Co-
Teaching methods and effective planning of instruction. Furthermore, teachers receive in school support via the Director of 
English Language Learners, Dr, Santos, Borough Office support staff and administration. Attendance and records are taken at 
the staff conference meetings and all of these documents are filed in our multitude of PD binders, We also keep a professional 
development plan/log, which keeps records of the days, times and hours of PD provided to staff. Focused learning walks are 
conducted throughout the year to ensure that all teachers are employing strategies for teaching ENL students.    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Every Tuesday is devoted to parent engagement. The purpose of this time is to discuss the goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs. Many teachers in our 
school building have been exceptionally proactive in organizing workshops for parents on a variety of topics, some of which 
include: Using technology to help your child become a better reader (using My-On and Imagine Learning and Fundations at 
home), Strategies to help your child become a better reader, Building Phonemic awareness and language development with 
Fundations. A Saturday ENL Academy is offered to the Parents of all ELLs and is facilitated by a former bilingual education 
professor, who is now a consultant for Attanasio & Associates, who's expertise is developing materials for ELLs. There are 45 
parents present at each ENL Parent Saturday Academy session, including both Spanish and Bengali parents. When possible 
both the ENL teacher and classroom teacher meet to discuss specific needs and progress. Parent workshops specific to the ENL 
population are continuously provided throughout the year. The PTA and SLT have worked jointly to provide parents workshops 
at every monthly PTA meeting.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

At present, our PTA board is composed of parents that speak Spanish and Bengali. The PTA is always encouraging parents of 
other languages to run for any of the elected seats. In addition, all parents are encouraged to participate in both school and 
PTA sponsored activities. We have parents that volunteer to interpret in Bengali and other languages where staff is not 
knowledgeable when the need arises.  
 

 

 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
 
The process utilized to initially identify students is diligently monitored and tracked by the school pupil personnel secretary working 
closely with the certified ESL teachers. P.S. 82Q also endeavors to ensure all ELL students take the NYSESLAT assessment which is 
utilized by the school to identify academic weakness/strengths, entry and exits to the ESL program. Teachers use NYSEALAT mock 
assessments to add to the data accumulated to aid in meeting the instructional needs of the ELL students. The students' level of

literacy in their native languages is a significant factor in purchasing materials for instruction, classroom libraries and for use at 
home. Instructional materials are available on many levels in order to help children learn English while learning content at the 
same time. Knowledge of the students' level of literacy is used to effectively plan differentiated instruction. In the bilingual 
classroom, proficiency in both the native language and in English is taken into account in planning instruction. Our focus is to 
demystify the English language so that we can accelerate cognitive academic language proficiency before a second language stall 
occurs.We purchase reading materials in dual languages to give native language support and these materials can be found in 
classroom libraries, the school library and the Parent Coordinator's room.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Grisel Rodriuez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
