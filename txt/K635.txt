Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our mission: We engage over-age, under-credited students with relevant, rigorous, personalized learning experiences 
through which they master the skills necessary for higher education, work and life. We achieve this mission through a 
unique program of blended asynchronous learning that allows every student a personalized pathway to success at a 
pace best suited to him or her.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Olympus Academy is a transfer high school located in Canarsie, Brooklyn, serving students who have not met with 
success in traditional high school environments.  

 

Our small school serves as a second home to our students, who speak of the school community as “family.” As part of 
the New Visions Affinity Group, Olympus school leaders collaborate with other dynamic transfer school leaders 
through a Critical Friends Group that meets monthly to share best practices in school leadership. Further, the school 
collaborates with a wider group of transfer schools through the Transfer School Institute, a program overseen by the 
Office of Post-Secondary Readiness. Olympus was also selected as a PROSE school in the competitive program’s 
inaugural year. 

 

As a transfer high school, we serve a population of over-age, under-credited youth. These students have previously 
struggled in school due to a variety of causes: health problems for either the student or a relative, psychological 
problems, trauma, homelessness, pregnancy, and gang affiliation; or simply disenfranchisement, detachment, 
disengagement or disillusionment. These students need individualized supports: a caring adult, individualized 
schedules and graduation plans, counseling, mediation, jobs and internships, and help gaining access to outside 
services. Furthermore, a significant portion of our student population is eligible for special education services. These 
students need small class sizes, individualized attention in classrooms, emotional support and more. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

One special population found at Olympus Academy is our student with disabilities. These students need to have 
access to differentiated, yet rigorous instruction and curriculum. Additionally, our SWD's require a designated point 
person to help make sure their needs are being met.  

 

Another special population found at Olympus Academy are our students who are newly arrived to this country and 
are attending NYC public schools for the first time. These student require help in understanding the educational 
requirements of NYC school system, as well as the college application process.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our greatest area of success during the 2017-2018 school year was in the area of school culture. Olympus Academy 
received a rating of well developed for school culture on the 2017-2018 school quality review. The achievement was 
reflected in the 2017-2018 school quality guide, which showed growth in all metrics related to school culture. This 
included a metric score increase from 3.03 to 3.22 for supportive environment and a change from 4.07 to 4.41 in the 
areas of trust.  

 

 

Two of our key areas of focus for the 2018-2019 school year are student discussion and assessment. Even though our 
scores on the 2017-2018 quality guide showed some growth in these areas, the scores remain low. Feedback from the 
2017-2018 quality review also suggests that we should continue focusing on student discussion and assessment. 
Further justification for these choices are outlined below in our needs assessment and action plans.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
1. The 2017-2018 School Quality Guide showed: 

 

STRENGTHS: The 2017-2018 School Quality Guide showed that the school has made strides in fostering quality 
student discussion in the classroom. The School Quality Guide showed in increase in positive response rate for the 
category of Quality of Student Discussions from 53% in 2016-2017 to 76% in 2017-2018, exceeding the CEP goal by 
13%.  

 

NEEDS: The 2017-2018 School Quality Guide showed that Academic Press had a metric score of 2.75 with 67% 
positive responses. The weakest areas were Q5a on which we scored 48% (which asked students if they felt 
challenged in their classes); Q5b on which we scored 50% ( collected students' responses on if they were asked 
difficult questions on tests); and Q5c on which we scored 48% (asked students if they get difficult questions in 
class). This shows that we need to put more focus on improving Danielson components 3c. Engaging Students in 
Learning and Danielson Component 3d. Using Assessment in Instruction. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
The measurement of Academic Press at Olympus Academy, indicated in the 2018-2019 School Quality Guide will show 
an increase of five percentage points by June 26, 2019. This will improve the positive response rate related to 
Academic Press from 67% to 72%.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 
Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

As part of our work with the Transfer School Institute, we will 
form a team that will collaborate with a coach from Redesign. 
The focus of the team will be to develop and implement strong 
assessment practices. These practices can then be turn keyed to 
other staff members during our weekly Monday professional 
development sessions. The special education coordinator and 
other members of the special education department will be 
involved in the implementation of these practices to ensure that 
they are modified for SWD's. Also, at the start of the school year 
teachers were provided with professional development 
regarding tools and strategies for ELL populations. There will be 
additional sessions scheduled throughout the year, allowing the 
teaches to incorporate these methods into their assessment and 
intervention practices.  

Administration will collaborate with the peer collaborative 
teacher (PCT) and model teacher to design professional 
development and targeted supports for individual teachers.  

The humanities department will meet once a week during the 
designated professional development time to ensure that the 
schools English and Social Studies curricula is vertically aligned. 
The humanities team includes a certified special education 
teachers.  

Working in departmental teams, teachers will share best 
practices and collaborate in order to design high quality 
assessments and intervention strategies. This will take place 
during weekly after school meetings and during daily C-6 time.  

Course syllabi are available to parents via the school learning 
management system, allowing parents to see understand the key 
skills and concepts that students will be assessed on.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
The guidance counselor and CBO director will also conduct a meeting to explain the academic shifts to parents and 
explain why the incorporation of more discussion in classes is beneficial to students' developing communication skills 
and learning how to collaborate effectively with others. The initial conversation will take place on Family engagement 
night in September 2018. Follow up conversations will occur during PA meetings throughout the year as we get 
feedback and suggestions from parents.  

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
Monitoring of teacher activities will occur during regular work hours and won't require additional funding. The school 
will also use the Redesign coach provided by the TSI to assist in guiding teachers as the develop and implement 
routines and procedures to promote academic discussion among students. Additional resources will be made 
available as needed. The TSI coach is free of charge. The weekly PD time will also be used to analyse the effectiveness 
of the action research being done in the classroom through inquiry teams.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
Progress will be monitored via classroom walk-throughs, and informal observations. The Danielson rubric will be used 
during classroom walkthrough's to assess the effectiveness of the student discussion and assessment techniques 
being implemented in the classroom. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
By February 2019, a survey of students will be conducted to gauge students' perception of the quality and frequency 
of assessment in the classroom. The survey will mimic the actual questions presented on the school quality guide, 
allowing us to ascertain if we are improving in academic press. The survey will also be aligned with tri-state rigor audit 
tool.  

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

STRENGTHS: The school received a proficient in the area of assessment on the 2017-2018 quality review. This 
demonstrated an improvement from the 2015-2016 quality review in which the school received a developing.  

 

NEEDS: Despite our positive ratings for school culture and high expectations, we scored a developing in the area of 
pedagogy on the 2017-2018 Quality Review. This shows that we have to increase the capacity of our teachers to 
deliver high quality instruction to our students to ensure that we are adequately preparing them to attain post-
secondary success. Additionally, according to the 2017-2018 school quality guide, only 83% of students know what 
their teacher wants them to learn in class (Q2e). This shows that there is a disconnect between what is being, 
planned taught, and assessed in the classroom.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
 

By the end of the 2019 all core subject area classes will have been audited and modified to ensure alignment of written, 
taught and assessed curricula. This will result in an increase of from 83% to 88% on question Q2e of the school survey.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

At our annual 2017-2018 staff retreat, administration previewed 
this work to teachers and discussed the differences and 
connections between planned, written, and assessed curricula. 
During the final week of summer 2018, Olympus Academy holds 
a week of professional development. One day will be dedicated 
to beginning the auditing and revising of the curricula.  

Early in the 2018-2019, school year a group of students will be 
asked to look at curricula and assessments to gain their 
perspective on what is taught in the classroom. This will be done 
again later in the year to track the progress of the work from a 
students point of view. The students selected for this will 
represent a variety of grade and skill levels, and will include SWD 
and ELL populations. 

The assistant principal, with the help of TSI coaches, will conduct 
a curricula and assessment audit throughout the year. Data from 
the audit will be compared to data gained from informal 
classroom visits and observations. This will allow administration 
to measure the alignment between what is being taught, 
planned, and assessed in the classroom. Based on this 
information, administration and the peer collaborative teacher 
will plan on going professional development and inquiry work 
related to curricula alignment. The special education coordinator 
will be consulted with during this process to ensure the 
differentiation is being planned for SWD's and ELL's.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

STRENGTHS: On the 2017-2018 school quality guide 99% of teachers responded positively in the area of teacher 
influence, resulting in a metric score 4.8 in that category. This shows that teachers feel empowered to make 
important decisions in regards to their pedagogical practice.  

 

Needs: Although 94% of teachers responded favorably in he category of Program Coherence, there is still room for 
improvement. Only 89% of teachers gave a positive response on Q8e regarding the school following up on 
initiatives to assess their effectiveness.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
On the 2018-2019 school quality guide, more than 92% percent of teachers will respond positively on question Q8e 
regarding the school following up on initiatives to assess their effectiveness. During the 2017-2018 school year, 89% 
percent of teachers responded favorably to this question.

The principal and assistant principal will continue to collaborate 
with teacher leaders in the planning of the teacher led 
professional development. Additionally, The principal and 
assistant principal will continue to regularly participate in 
professional development sessions and team meetings and 
invite additional teachers to join non-departmental teacher 
teams. 

The principal and assistant principal will work with teacher 
leaders to refine and implement uniform protocols to be used in 
all team meetings. This will ensure that teacher teams are able 
to adequately document and track the progress of their their 
initiatives.  

 

All teachers will be participating in inquiry work using a modified 
consultancy protocol to look at student work. By doing this 
teachers will be work with their colleagues to measure the 
impact of tools and strategies developed in their teacher teams. 
This will include examing studnet work from SWD's and ELL's.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: Parent responses on the Learning Environment Survey (LES) are overwhelmingly positive, indicating strong 
parent approval of the school and its practices. The 2017-2018 School Quality Guide shows that 97% of families feel 
respected and trust the principal. Additionally, a 100% of parents surveyed trust the schools teachers and feel that 
teachers work hard to establish a partnership with families.  

 

Weaknesses: The parent response rate to 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey (LES) dropped by 3%; it was 23% 
during the 2016-2017 school year. However, only 20% parents responded during the 2017-2018 school year. 
Establishing a goal of increased participation on the LES will ensure that more parents are heard, and that more 
parents have opportunities to be involved in school life.An increase in school survey completion will be evidence of an 
increased level of family investment in the school community. Frequent and productive parent outreach prior to the 
admission of the survey will serve to create strong relationships between pedagogical staff and parents manifesting in 
a increased response rate. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
The 2018-2019 parent survey will show a response rate increase of 5%; this will result in a increase from 20% to 25%, 
while maintaining an overall positive response rating.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Olympus Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Olympus Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● The College Access for All Team will inform the parents and students about the college application process with 
detailed information on TAP, PELL, and Excelsior Scholarships.  

● Teachers will conduct targeted out reach to parents in the form form letters, email and phone calls. Out reach will 
focus: celebrating student achievement, informing parents about Regents prep, lack of progress, and lab completion.  

● Advocate counselors will conduct outreach to parents about their children's attendance.  

● Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

● Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their children's progress; 

● Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

● Launch our school's updated LMS (learning management system) which for the first time will allow parents to 
regularly check their children's progress online. 

● Provide training on the school's LMS (Canvas) to ensure that parents understand how to use the system to monitor 
their children's progress. 

● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● Engage parents in discussion regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly to the school 
to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

● The schools CBO serves as a liaison between the school and families. The CBO staff will provide parent workshops 
based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The CBO staff will also maintain a log of events and activities 
planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 

● Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● Conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● Holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Olympus has assessed the early literacy skills of all students including ENL with teacher made pre-assessments designed to 
assess skills in determining importance, inferencing, questioning, activating schema, and predictions. Our school follows a 
blended learning model. The results of that assessment determines the curriculum path the student follows according to how 
much skill practice is needed. There is also one for math skills. Every student takes STAR assessments upon intake and twice 
more during the year,  for literacy and math as it keeps track of progress and is adaptive.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

All students take STAR Reading upon entry so we can gauge the students reading level. The Star reading assessment results 
can be compared to the baseline to ensure that students are progressing at an acceptable pace. Humanities teachers also co-
plan and write curricula to address student needs. There are scaffolds built into every course that allows for differentiation 
and are designed to improve students reading and writing skills. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Olympus Academy has very few ELL students traditionally. We evaluate the success of our program individually as we do many 
of our target groups. The goal is to graduate them within 6 years.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We have after school tutoring, Saturday school and zero period AIS. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
All students are advanced ENL students, where they have, and will continue to sit for regents, and have been successful at 
passing the exams. All ENL students are placed in classes where 2 teachers are available if they need extra help, as well as their 
ENL class for added support. Saturday school and after school are also made available so they can get extra help as needed.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Inquiry teams, as well as department teams, look at the data to see where students have skill deficits and move forward from 
there. They create skill workshops to help them bridge that gap.  

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

There is currently one push-in  ENL class offered at Olympus Academy, with pullout small group instruction provided 
when needed.. Each class is 48 min long so there is 240 minutes of ENL instruction provided per week. The ENL 
teacher confers and collaborates with the ELA teacher for the English class (also 240 min a week) to differentiate the 
instruction and provide support for the literacy strategies. The program models are ungraded heterogenous classes. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A   

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           The ENL teacher provides explicit ENL instruction for 180 minutes a week (classes are 48 min long). The online model 
provides multiple opportunities to confer with students  and provide one on one support in all content area classes.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   All Common Core aligned content area class work and homework are reviewed and supported during the push in ENL class. 
As needed, the ENL teacher pulls the ELL students out of class for small group instruction, as well as individual one to one. The 
ENL teacher has access to all of the students online curriculum and what skills are being assessed. The ENL teacher works on 
the literacy strategies with the ELL students using the actual content of the content area teachers. The students have access to 
native language materials through print and online media for enrichment and support. So far, Olympus Academy has only 
needed Spanish and Haitian Creole materials. As needed, other language print materials will be purchased. Common Core 
materials in Spanish has been purchased.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Our current students prefer English speaking assessments. Should we get students with alternate preferences, the ENL 
teacher in conjunction with the Spanish speaking Sped teacher (and alternate language translators if needed), will create the 
same assessments given to the student in English in their content areas in order to highlight the most challenging areas of 
need for extra instruction. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

         a. In addition to their required minutes of ENL & ELA instruction, SIFE students will receive one on one and group 
counseling (once a week for each), should we enroll any ELL SiFE students. 
        b. ELLs in US schools for less than three years (in addition to the 180 minutes of ENL instruction) will also receive Saturday 
enrichment with the ENL teacher and after-school tutoring specifically designed to work on literacy skills, should we enroll any. 
        c. ELLs receiving service 4-6 years (in addition to the 180 minutes of ENL instruction) receive after school tutoring to work 
on comprehension and test taking strategies, should we enroll any. 
        d. Long term ELLs (in addition180 minutes of ELA and 180 minutes of ENL instruction) will receive tutoring for Regents and 
the NYSESLAT exams from 8:00AM-8:45AM every morning with the ENL teacher. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
       We currently do not have any ELL-SWD students. Olympus uses the Canvas platform to create and differentiate curriculum 
to align with the common core standards as well as assess skill level and proficiency level for all students. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
        Any ELL that is identified as special needs will have language acquisition goals included in their IEP. The Present Level of 
Performance anecdotal will include their current NYSESLAT modalities as part of their assessment results. ESL students treat 
the push in ESL class as tutoring, as well as their ICT setting where they have 2 teachers to support their needs. They use the 
one-on-one) instruction as an opportunity to move ahead in other content area work as well as enhance their math and 
literacy skills in order to meet their IEP goals. . 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The ENL teacher confers with the ELA teacher and plans differentiated activities for the ENL students, when needed. The ENL 
teacher meets with each content area teacher once a week to conference about the individual students, discussing strengths,

challenges, possible interventions, and upcoming lessons, so that the ENL teacher can support their work and the student. The 
ELLs are also placed in the push-in Sped classrooms so they can benefit from 2 teachers in the classroom as well. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

No new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year, unless we get a sudden influx of new 
ELLs, this will be revisited with the LAP team.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

None.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Before school tutoring, after school tutoring, and Saturday school is offered to all students, including ELLs.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional materials include native language print materials as well as access to online translation programs. Every 
classroom has a library that also contains literature and textbooks written in Spanish and Creole. There are Spanish and French 
dictionaries available. All Olympus classrooms have computers which allows access to websites and documents in our ELLs 
native language, as well as translation software online. When ELLs of other languages enroll in our school, Olympus will 
purchase those native language materials as well. Every teacher uses appropriate curriculum materials, textbooks, and 
instructional aids, which promote critical thinking skills and reflect standards-based work and higher order thinking. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is delivered through the ENL model through native language print materials and internet resources. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The Olympus ELLs are all Advanced and span grades 9-12. Both have been ELLS for over 10 years. Olympus provides one-on-
one academic support in all subjects and the college advisor also meets with the higher credited ELLs (and the other seniors) to 
help navigate the path to college and career readiness. the Spanish speaking Sped teacher is the assistant college advisor to 
assist our ELLs.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Instructional materials include native language print materials as well as access to online translation programs. Every 
classroom has a library that also contains literature and textbooks written in Spanish and Creole. There are Spanish and French 
dictionaries available. All Olympus classrooms have computers which allows access to websites and documents in our ELLs 
native language, as well as translation software online. When ELLs of other languages enroll in our school, Olympus will 
purchase those native language materials as well. Every teacher uses appropriate curriculum materials, textbooks, and 
instructional aids, which promote critical thinking skills and reflect standards-based work and higher order thinking. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Olympus students have advocate counselors, as well as the DOE guidance counselor, Oral Johnson, in assisting the student. 
Students do attend an orientation session ran by the CBO staff, with the support of DOE, to make students feel welcome.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We currently offer Spanish language courses with an option to take French if they so desire.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional development is provided  in conjunction with ReDesign and TSCCI, during Monday PLCs, weekday curriculum team 
meetings, and summer institute on scaffolding strategies, cooperative learning, differentiated instruction, Understanding by 
Design, Principles of Learning, Bloom’s Taxonomy, and questioning techniques to improve instruction and support the 
development of our ELL students. All online curriculum is constantly being revisited and realigned to the Common Core 
Learning Standards based on assessment results. 
Provide differentiated supervision to each teacher to ensure that curriculum and teaching are aligned to our goals and that our 
ELL students are being serviced, Saturday trainings offered on literacy development. Professional Learning Teams weekly: 
require teachers working together to plan, look at student work, and assess needs. Inquiry teams will look at ELL and Sped 
subgroups weekly.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Smart board training PDs were purchased by the principal to ensure that teachers are getting PD hours made available. 
Teachers are also notified by their chapter leader on updated PDs available to meet their 15% total hours, as well as the 50% 
for ENL certified teachers.  
The assistant principal keeps the meeting attendance sheets when PDs are held at the school. Agendas and PD plans are kept 
in a shared Google Doc. All records of teacher training for ELLs (and all training) are kept in the file for emplyee records.  A 
copy of training hours are kept in ESL binder. Teachers are also responsible to hold their own copies and record sheets.  
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Currently our ELLs are very advanced and prefer their assessments and work in English. That is determined at the beginning of 
the year when we hold our ELL meeting. Since enrollment is on a rolling basis, any other ELLS that come to our school has an 
individual family meeting to go over previous NYSESLAT results, state assessments and progress goals for the year. For Spanish 
speaking parents and students, our special ed and/or Spanish speaking music teacher is used. Should any other language be 
needed, DOE translation services will be provided. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Question 2: All Ell records are kept in an ELL binder along with all NYSESLAT info, parental choice letters, and copies of HLIS 
(originals kept in students cumulative records).  Calls and letters mailed are included in ILOG and NYCID's logs in Powerschool. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

Question 3: Parents are involved in the intake process from the beginning. Our special ed and music teacher provides 
translation in Spanish, and we request translators for other languages as needed. Intake documents, welcome letters, and 
orientation materials are available in Spanish, Haitian Creole, French, and Arabic. A Parent Orientation Meeting for all parents 
will take place prior to the beginning of school. An ELL meeting with the LAP committee, translators, and ELL parents and 
students will also take place prior to the beginning of school, to inform parents about the ESL program and our academic 
offerings. Parents receive progress reports once a month. Olympus Academy holds several family nights throughout the year.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Bruce Gonzales, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We use the Home Language Surveys and blue cards for the hard data of parent language preferences. During 
intake interviews and orientation, the counselors determine which parents need translators. For anyone that 
needs Spanish, the Spanish speaking sped teacher is brought in for the interview. We also have a staff member 
who is fluent Haitian Creole. If there are any other preferences, the Translation Unit will be contacted. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Prior to mailing the letters we will 
review the results of the home 
language survey, based on the 
finding we will have the letters 
translated by the translation unit.  

At the start of the 2017-2018 school 
year we will review the results of the 
home language survey and submit 
the danger of failing letter for 
translation. We will request that the 
letter be translated into all languages 
represented in our school. 
Throughout the 2017-2018 school 
year we will periodically review the 
survey results to make sure we are 
servicing the needs of all incoming 
students.  

We will review the home language 
preferences of all incoming Juniors 
and Seniors to make sure that all 
notifications have been submitted to 
the translation unit and represent 
the preferred languages of the 
families of our Junior and Senior 
class.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

We will ensure that we have accurate and available records regarding the preferred language of the families of our 
entire school population. This information is readily available to the students advocate counselor, assistant principal, 
and the school guidance counselor. In cases where the family speaks Spanish or Haitian Creole, we will have our staff 
members who are fluent in those languages conduct the outreach. The DOE translation unit will be used if if these 
staff members are not present or if another language is required.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

When all staff reports to the school on 9/5/17, they will be given regulation A-663 as part of the staff handbook. A 
training session will be conducted at this time to familiarize staff with the resources that are available to ensure 
language access for the families of all students.

  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

All documents on the checklist will be posted in the main lobby of the school. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?
