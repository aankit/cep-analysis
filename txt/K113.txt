Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

morally. To excel, compete and sustain the innovations of a rapidly changing society. To motivate our urban children 
and develop tomorrow's leaders through an accelerated curriculum, the Arts, Sciences and Technology.  

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Ronald Edmonds Learning Center (RELC) is a middle school serving grades 6 through grade 8. A diverse student body 
which includes English language learners(5%) and students with Individualized Education Plans (30%). Boys account 
for 51% of the students enrolled and girls account for 49%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2016-
2017 was 90% and teachers with 96%. ( 2016-2017 School Quality Snapshot) 

Our Arts and Technology programs are unique features of our academic program. Students receive 5-6 periods per 
week of their specific art discipline which provides the opportunity for cross-curricular learning. The Art disciplines 
follow the New York City Department of Education Blueprint for the Arts and teachers participate in weekly content 
planning to discuss the integration and implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards for English Language 
Arts and Math in the Arts. 

In addition, our school offers a Spanish dual language program which follows the Teachers College Reading and 
Writing Project units of study integrated with a social studies or science theme to match the New York City scopes and 
sequences for those content areas. In Math, students follow the Common Core Learning Standards and math 
instruction will be split across both languages. Students will receive at least 13 periods per week in Spanish 8 periods 
of Math in Spanish and 5 periods of Science in Spanish. Students in the dual language program will become bi literate, 
bi cultural and bilingual. 

Our after school operates in partnership with Long Island University. The Advantage after school program operates 
Monday - Friday, from 2;30 - 5:45p, and offers students academic enrichment, assistance, sports and clubs.  

Our community partnerships provide additional opportunities for students to extend their learning. presently, we 
have partnerships with Long Island University, New York University PolyTech STEM Program, Brooklyn Technical High 
School, Creative Outlet. We are an Urban Advantage school which offer students additional STEM opportunities and 
exposure for parents. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our school is 30% Student with Disabilities and 5% ENL students. The students of these populations need support with 
basic reading and computation skills. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

While our school did not have a Quality review in 2016-2017, both the 2015-2016 and 2017-2018 Quality Review 
rated the school proficient in all areas. Our school made progress in the all six (6) of the framework elements as noted 
in the 2017 - 2018 School Quality Guide and the following 3 elements were noted for the most progress: .  

1.  Rigorous Instruction  

The2017- 2018 framework element scores indicated an increase in the Common Core shifts in literacy from 
3.28 in 2016-2017 to 3.41 in 2017-2018, an increase +.13. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Teachers planned Common Core aligned units and implemented lesson plans embedded with rigorous 
student tasks and work products driven by a strong instructional core instruction that promoted high levels of 
student engagement and inquiry for all learners. Teachers deepened their strategic use of scaffolded 
questions and conversation prompts to promote student engagement. 

2.  Collaborative Teachers 

On the 2016-2017 framework element scores, the school scored 3.17 and in 2017-2018 the school received 
3.32, an increase of +.15. In particular, the 2017-2018 Quality Review noted 4.2 - Teacher Teams and 
Leadership Development as an area of celebration. In particular, the area of the quality of professional 
Development indicated that 86% of teachers said that their professional experiences this year have been 
sustained and coherent and 87% of teachers said that they had opportunities to work productively with 
teachers at their school on professional development 

100% of our teachers participated in sustained and coherently focused professional development which 
included enough time to think carefully about, try and evaluate their learnings. In addition, teachers were 
given time and opportunities to work productively with their colleagues as well as attend professional 
development off site. The Staff developer/consultants from Teacher College Reading and Writing Project, 
Brooklyn North and District 13 engaged teachers in sustained structured professional development by content 
throughout the year through lab sites, one on one coaching and team inquiry that focused on improved 
student learning by strengthening teacher practice. 

3.  Trust  

The most progress noted was in the element of Trust, from 3.12 in 2016-2017 to 3.73 in 2017-2018., a +.61 increase. 
This is +0.34 compared to the district average and +0.05 compared to the city average.  

 

Our two key areas of focus in 2018-2019 are : 

  Rigorous Instruction  

According to the survey element scores on the 2017-2018 School Quality guide, shifts in common core literacy 
were 6% less than the city average. To address this, teachers will ENGAGE students in RIGOROUS TASKS 
through their STRATEGIC USE of SCAFFOLDED QUESTIONS and CONVERSATION PROMPTS to promote, HIGH 
QUALITY DISCUSSION, and EXPANDED PROBLEM SOLVING and WRITING SKILLS. 

Supportive Environment 

A weekly advisory period will be included in every student's program to provide a structured time to address students 
social emotional needs and provide personal attention and support

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
The school's strengths in this area, based on the 2017-2018 School Quality Report, are Course Clarity and Quality of 
Student discussions with scores of 3.50 and 3.61 respectively. On both measures the school scored higher as 
compared to the district average as well as compared to the city average on the quality of student discussions (+4%)  

Overall, in Rigorous Instruction, according to the 2017-2018 School Quality guide, shifts in common core literacy score 
was 2.40. This is the lowest score in this measure and is - 6% less than the city average. Particularly, academic press 
was the survey measure with the lowest percentage of positive responses (69%). Based on the data from the 2017-
2018 School Quality Guide, 47% of students noted that teachers ask difficult questions, 55% of students said that they 
were challenged in class and 57% said that teachers ask difficult questions on tests. Consequently, teachers will need 
to ENGAGE students in more RIGOROUS TASKS through their STRATEGIC USE of SCAFFOLDED QUESTIONS and 
CONVERSATION PROMPTS to promote, HIGH QUALITY DISCUSSION, and EXPANDED PROBLEM SOLVING and 
WRITING SKILLS. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 100% of English Language Arts teachers in Grades 6-8 will implement the Teacher's College Reading and 
writing workshop resulting in a 5% increase in student performance on the End of the Year ELA Measure of Student 
Learning(MOSL) and a 5% increase in students positive responses in academic press survey element.

On all of the New York City school survey measures, our school scored higher as compared to the district and in all but 
one scored higher as compared to the city average ( 2017-2018 School Quality Guide). However, based on student 
responses in the measure of safety, 42% of students say that students rarely or never harass, bully or intimidate other 
students at their school. Therefore, the school leader and student support staff need to work together to use data to 
respond to students’ social and emotional developmental needs to create a safe environment so students can 
become academically and socially successful (2017-2018 School Quality Guide). 

Our school has the following policies, practices and structures in place to ensure we are supporting the whole child: 

  Chancellor Code of Disciple 
  RELC code of conduct 
  Homerooms 
  Deans 
 


that promotes shared leadership and focuses on improved student learning. All teachers participate in the weekly 
content teams meetings and utilize a common analysis protocol to look at student work and common assessment 
data to: 

a) uncover students misconceptions and challenges,  

b) address learning gaps, plan rigorous instruction and share instructional strategies and c)share behavioral trends 
that might be impacting on student performance .  

To further support this work teachers need sustained and coherently focused professional development to support 
their instructional practices and strategies in meeting: 

a) the school wide writing instructional focus  

b) strengthening student engagement and  

c) responding to students and creating a supportive and safe environment (2016 Framework for Great Schools). 

Although an area of celebration, only 48% of teachers responded that they had opportunities to work productively 
with teachers from other schools on professional development (2017-2018 School Quality Guide). As a result, the 
priority need will addressed and provide opportunities for professional learning with teachers from other schools.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, as a result of participating in out of school professional development series and/or sessions with teachers 
from other schools there will be a 5% increase from 48% to 53% of teacher favorable responses on the Learning Survey 
about Quality of Professional development.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 13K113, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

M.S. 113 Ronald Edmonds Learning Center will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology;

members of the school community; 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38

or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events;

activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

13K113, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The school uses the NYSISTEL and baseline assessments from TCRWP to establish the literacy skills of ELLs. In addition, the ESL 
teacher, at the beginning of the school year, provides all staff members with a list of ELL and their proficiency levels so that 
content-area instructors can establish the needs of ELLs and develop strategies to employ so that students make gains in the 
content areas.  
Data confirms that our ESL teacher should continue to reinforce content material through the CALLA method of 
instruction.  She provides instruction by means of an extensive use of graphic organizers, KWL charts, outlines, visuals and 
video, as well as collaborative group work to help students make gains in reading and writing. Based on this analysis, our ESL 
instructor will also continue to align instruction, whenever possible, with content-area teachers as that has been an additional 
effective instructional approach that allows our ELLs to grasp content.     
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of the program is evaluated by cross-referencing data comprised of ARIS scores, NYSESLAT scores and their ELA 
and Math scores. The ESL teacher analyzes how students' attendance, performance in the ESL program is, first and foremost, 
reflective or dovetailed with students' performance on state exams. Similarly, the ESL instructor also has students analyze their 
own scores at the beginning of each year. They are to list how they perform in each modality, to list their lowest scores and 
explain how they expect to improve, to list how many more points that they need to make in order to test at the next level of 
on the NYSESLAT. So, in this way, the teacher and the student are aware of whether or not the students were able to make the 
gains they were expected to make in each modality of the NYSESLAT, yet specifically, the modality in which they scored the 
lowest.  
The ESL teacher also uses the data from these scores to pedict and to generate a list who are the precipice of passing. The 
teacher also uses the data to generate a list and to predict a list of students are expected to make progress-move from one 
level to the next only (most students, the trend at MS113 shows, are so close to moving from one level to the other, that it is 
not expected that they make progress by achieving that 40 pts they need to make in modalities). So, at the end of the 2012-
2103 academic year, 15 out of 18 students were expected to pass leaving the rate of students testing out at 83%. In addition, 
17 students were supposed to make progress, based on the review of the data as aforementioned, and 15 students made 
progress: 83% as well. 
The need for cross-referencing that data is also helping in getting students invested in their studies. For example, the ESL 
teacher has the students closely look at their ELA and math scores, and how they performed on each band. She looked at how 
many of her ELLs needed 0.15 to .01 points to scores at the next level. Based on the number of students who took advantage 
of Saturday and after school programming and who were invested in their learning, the ESL instructor expected, after 
reviewing data, 11 students to move to a level 2 if they were level 1s or to a level 3 if they were level 2s. Ten out of the 11 
students met that goal. 
  
The data proves that the analyses of her students provides our ESL instructor with the means to really know her students and 
how to help them make progress. Attendance is reviewed, the use of the writing framework and how it helps students write 
more cohesively is reviewed, how the ESL teacher tries to, to the best of her ability, align instruction with content-area 
teachers, and reveals that the success of our program is mixed.  Though the social aspect of the program, the fact that the 
students feel comfortable and trust the instructor as well as the parents, the fact that there is positive feedback from parents 
and staff members who feel that they see ESL students making progress even in raising their hands in class (they are gaining 
confidence to try), in speaking and writing is becoming more fluid, there are still improvements to make. In terms of academic 
gains, 65% of our ELLs are performing according to standards for exams and for passing and achieving in content-area classes. 
In terms of inclusion and recognition, ELLs are fully integrated into the school’s mission and activities.  Programming decisions 
are made according to a student’s language proficiency and extra support is given as mentioned above. There is still a need to 
aim for grouping ELLs in the same homerooms so that push-ins are a viable option for servicing our ELLs. For the time being, 
the pull-out system allows for most of our ELLs to receive their mandated minutes of instruction.    
  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Based on the assessment of school data, educators at MS113--the ESL teacher included-- will continue to reinforce speaking, 
listening, reading and writing skills in order to promote their success in the ESL program. Yet, more importantly, MS113 
educators will continue to focus on reading and writing to equip students with the necessary tools they need in order to thrive 
academically across the disciplines.  
  
The data also confirms that there is a need and a benefit of continuing to put emphasis on utilizing Common Core-based tasks 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

to help students develop stamina for state exams, to familiarize students with Common Core verbiage and to prepare students 
for performance tasks by unpacking directives. Further, the data also proves that the instructors must keep helping students 
develop their ability to comprehend and to employ text-domain vocabulary. Finally, the data confirms that instructors must 
continue to promote understanding through visuals and/or media and through discussion and critical thinking.    
  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The students at MS 113 are generally proficient in speaking and listening, with scores in reading and writing showing areas of 
improvement.  This year a large number of our students reached a commanding level. The students who conferenced with the 
ESL instructor to see how close they were to higher ELA and math scores, who analyzed their latest NYSESLAT scores as well, 
who attended ESL classes and met the mandated minutes of instruction, who invested their time in their work to make 
academic achievements in the ESL class and who took advantage of Common Core-based instruction during the Saturday or 
after school sessions made the achievement of moving from Intermediate to Advanced or from Beginner to Advanced on the 
NYSESLAT. On the other hand, many of these sames students moved up to the next level on state exams, from 1 to 2 in Math 
or in ELA or in some cases to 3s in one area.   Many Advanced students who fell under this criteria of being academically 
invested and willing to take advantage of support services scored 2s in both areas.   
  
MSK113 only had one student sit for the NYSITELL last year, so there is not enough data to be analyzed. The one student who 
took the LAB-R last year tested at the Beginner level, which was expected as he had only been the country 10 months at the 
time. Based on his test results for the LAB-R, he was appropriately placed in the Beginner class and he sat in an extended day 
class with the ESL instructor. The instructor also pushed into 5 of his classes. His performance also revealed that he would test 
at a level 1 for math and ELA, and would, most likely, achieve Beginner-level status on the 2013 NYSESLAT. He needed a 
second year at the Beginner level to adjust to school in America and establish a comfort level that will allow him to make 
measureable gains-though he did do fairly well on the speaking and reading levels of the 2013 NYSESLAT for someone who had 
only been here for less than a year.   
  
Though there are still gains to make, overall, it can be confirmed that an analysis of data conveys that a balanced literacy 
approach used last year has allowed for some noteable progress for our ELL population. Class time spent on independent and 
guided reading to explore overarching themes, character development, plot and an analysis of authors' pupose as well as 
writing activities left students feeling less anxious about state exams and the NYSESLAT. This approach to instruction also 
afforded students an opportunity to demonstrate the depth to which they acquired knowledge, to benefit from a familiarity 
with the text-domain vocabulary and to exhibit their stamina to delve into writing analyses. As a result, the ELL 
population  performed as well as if not better (as in the case of some of our Advanced-level students) than members of the 
student body who participate in general education classes. For example, journal writing and scaffolded writing assignments 
that were used with graphic organizers simultaneously, a review of grading rubrics and checklists left many students writing 
more cohesively and equipped to employ a word bank full of more academic vocabulary and transitional words. In all, these 
strategies allowed for them to execute writing that had clear attempts at establishing or strong organization and fluidity.

of how capable this population is of responding to academic challenges--although quiet--will be a motivator for all MS113

educators to investigate all avenues of unfolding instruction that reinforces their understanding of material. 
c. Unfortunately, the periodic assessment was not administered last year. Students are not assessed in their native language. 
As far as math and ELA exams are concerned, the students are interviewed by the ESL instructor, and given an option about 
the possibility of exams being offered in their native languages. The ESL instructor makes it clear that they have the legal right 
to take exams in their native language, yet most opt for taking the exams in English. In the rare case where a student asks for 
the exam in his or her own native language, the testing coordinator orders those exams for that student. In turn, the Bengali 
students who wanted to have their exams in Bengali were told that they were not available for order through the network. 
However, the testing coordinator did contact the publisher of the exam for these 5 students to request a translation. Those 5 
students were told that there is no guarantee that the exam for either math or ELA will be available, but the request has been 
made, one that cannot be confirmed closer to the testing window opening. This procedure was done this and last year, 
however there is no data to describe how native language is used as a measure of success because no one took an exam in his 
or native language last year.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              The Beginner level students are a combination of students from 6th to 8th grade and they receive the 
mandated 360 minutes of instruction. The 8th grade students receive 180 minutes of instruction: Advanced and Intermediate 
level students. The 7th grade Advanced students receive 180 minutes of instruction, and the one 7th grade Intermediate 
student receives pull-out and push-in services, and so receives as close to her mandated minutes of instruction as possible: 
315 minutes. The 6th grade Advanced students receive their 180 mandates minutes of instruction whereas the Intermediates 
receive their 360 mandated minutes of instruction as well. The students are grouped based on their grade and proficiency 
levels with the exception of the Beginner-level students who are all grouped together. The school does not currently offer the 
a native language arts program, so the native language is developed implicitly. The ELA minutes of instruction are such that 
each student receives 320 minutes of instruction. For those students who do not receive the full mandated minutes of 
instruction, the network has been notified that the only reason those students are not receiving mandated minutes is because, 
contractually, the ESL instructor, Ms. K. Stinson, is already working 4 additional periods out of her contractual hours of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

instruction to service the ESL population at MS113 and has worked to the best of her ability to be in compliance for her 
students.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                In content areas, Beginner-level ELLs receive a lot of modeling, graphic organizers, visuals and formulaic approaches 
as well as the assistance of bilingual paras when possible.  They are buddied with another student who speaks their language 
and is proficient in the content area material.  Bilingual dictionaries and/or glossaries are made available.  In addition, content-
area teachers, as often as possible, for project-based work conference with the ELL instructor to develop and to design forms 
of scaffolding and differentiation for the specific needs of one or a group of ELLs in that specific content area classes. In 
addition, some teachers provide a list of content that can be reinforced in the ESL classroom or in the ESL-grouped extended 
day sessions. In turn, the ESL teacher also, creates assignments that allow students to explore their vocabulary development in 
ELA and ESL through the content, she frequently asks students to make connections between what they are learning in their 
content classes to her instruction. She gives assignments that are content-based as well. Further, the ELL instructor, to support 
the content area teachers, on an on-need and on-demand basis, will provide recommendations about how to align and to 
develop instruction specifically to help ELLs achieve on performance tasks. As a result, supplementary materials for visuals are 
used whenever available.  Intermediate and Advanced level students are encouraged to use English dictionaries, yet all ELLs 
are given vocabulary development exercises.  ELLs with special needs receive reinforcement in their self-contained classes 
where they are given opportunity and assistance in doing homework, in reading and in writing. In addition, specifically with 
Social Studies and Science content, graphic organizers, Venn-Diagrams, vocabulary word banks, videos, and realia have proven 
to be a powerful means of making information comprehensible for all of our ELLs, even former ELLs.  
  
The materials used in each program are used for sheltered English and ESL delivered using the CALLA method. The materials 
used novels or poems for each grouping, non-fiction (science or history-based) or informational texts, and, during test 
preparation, Attanasio NYSESLAT materials. The ESL teacher develops her lessons for the delivery instruction by using the 
CCLS; she specifically uses the standards to drive instruction, particulary in areas where the students need improvement and 
she develops lessons and performance tasks that are aligned with CCLS performance tasks and that use the CCLS academic 
language.   
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                Our greastest ELL populations are Bengali and Spanish speakers. So, students who are Bengali-speaking or Spanish-
speaking are encouraged to discuss tasks, whatever the modality, before they begin to execute them. In addition to having 
classroom vocabulary translated in advanced in order to make content more comprehensable for all the school's ELLs, the 
bilingual paras are asked, on a needs-basis, to attend ELL classes or to assist with reading or writing assignments to ensure that 
students can achieve to the task with as much success as possible.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a.SIFE Students 
For SIFE students, high-interest novels are provided as reading materials. We offer explicit ESL literacy skills and instruction 
(sheltered instruction, writing assignments that provide prompts, topic and concluding sentences and explicit instruction on 
how to transpose graphic organizers into cohesive writing pieces, paired work, homogeneous grouping, heterogeneous 
grouping with more proficient students who speaking their native language, visual aids, realia, videos and an activation of prior 
knowledge). ELLs at MS113 also have access to a leveled reading library that includes low-level to mid-range novels for 
independent reading. SIFE students are instructed in the same manner as long-term ELLs otherwise. See below. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

  
b.0-3 Years. 
 There is no student who is paired with a 1-1 paraprofessional, yet, students are paired with bilingual paraprofessionals when 
needed. They are also provided with leveled work, passages on 1st to 8th grade reading levels depending on their proficiency 
level. They work on vocabulary development, and, when necessary, translation from native language to English. They work on 
developing their listening and speaking skills first. ESL teachers also coordinate with core teachers and help them develop 
scaffolded activities with templates for writing, provide them with bilingual dictionaries, inform content teachers of testing 
accommodations and after school tutoring.  During high-stakes testing periods, students are tested in separate locations, given 
extended time and provided with bilingual glossaries or dictionaires with the exception of the Fulani speakers. This year, 
exams are also administered in their home language when available, and if requested. 
  
c. 4-6 years.  
These students also read high-interest novels and spend time on guided reading and writing activities: Common-Core based 
and NYSESLAT writing assignments. We incorporate small group work based on ability level.  Academic language and 
vocabulary for Common-Core based directions are directly taught  in preparation for state exams. After school tutoring is 
offered to prepare ELLs for exams to allow teachers to give the students one-on-one feedback on the deficiencies they need to 
work on in their writing. During high-stakes testing periods, students are tested in separate locations and given extended time. 
  
d. Long-Term ELLs 
Long-Term ELLs, who do attend school regularly, receive instruction which targets literacy skills explicitly.  The Long-Term ELLs 
have needs similar to Advanced students who need to prepare to transition out of ESL. As a result, their reading goals are to 
read with more fluency and fluidity, to recognize and to change word groupings (i.e. adverbs to verbs, nouns to adjective and 
vice versa), to cite for information that supports claims, and most importantly to unpack information in writing and reading 
tasks so that the direction are clearly understood and tasks successfully rendered.  Students also work on paraphrasing, using 
synonyms, employing text-domain vocabulary and writing prompts. In addition, they use graphic organizers to 
compartmentalize information for the purpose of determining importance and synthesizing information. They are also 
required to write paragraphs and essays after focusing on close readings of fiction, non-fiction and current events.  The writing 
processes also include workshops and peer-editing. Templates for Common Core-based questions are also used.  Students are 
encouraged to read and reread, to participate in think-alouds, discussions, and group work. The Long-Term ELLs in our school 
are either placed at the Intermediate level or the Advanced  level. Efforts are, on a regular basis, made to have students reflect 
on their own language learning process—metacognitive self-evaluation—and experience to discover ways how they have 
made gains and/or how they continue to improve. During high stakes testing periods, students are tested in separate 
locations, given extended time and provided with bilingual glossaries or dictionaries. State exams in their home language are 
offered when available, and if requested. 
  
e. Former ELLs' scores are also assessed. Those students who do place out are invited to continue services, specifically those 
students who have made considerable scores due to the fact that services were rendered and the student invested his or her 
time into achieving his or her own academic goals for the year (in either or all of the modalities: speaking, listening, reading for 
writing). The names of students who are Former ELLs are also given to instructors. In addition, the instructors are invited and 
encouraged to look at ARIS for Math and ELA scores. In addition to delivery of instruction within content areas, the instruction 
parallels that given to Long-Term ELLs.  
Like Long-Term Ells, for up to two years after passing the NYSESLAT, our former ELLs are grouped in classes where there is an 
emphasis on vocabulary, and thanks to our stream-linging of academic intervention for our students, Code-X published by 
Scholastic, is used from grades 6-7. With this resource for English Language Arts instruction, students will learn how to take 
ownership of high-occurrence words and text-domain vocabulary so that, once the text complexity increases, they have a 
means to comprehend readings. Students learn the forms of words (verbs, nouns, adjectives), collocations of words, and how 
to employ them with sentence frames and examples genereated by dint of paired activity completed in class. In addition to 
vocabulary development, the routines that Code-X gets students accustomed to requires them involve reading and rereading 
texts to unpack deeper meanings with each read, to participe in think-alouds/ discussions and to complete group work to 
promote language development that is embedded rich content-based learning directives. Further, for the delivery of 
instruction within content areas, the instruction parallels that which is given to Long-Term ELLs. Lastly, the school is working 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

with Michelle Kunnen  to engage in an Aussie-led targeted goal intervention program to ensure the success of students, 
specifically one that will help ELLs. Consequently, Ms. Kunnen is working with MS113’s educators to assist them with 
developing scaffolded lessons that aid the development of text-domain vocbulary and language functions. During high stakes 
testing periods, students are tested in separate locations, given extended time and provided with bilingual glossaries or 
dictionaries. State exams in their home language are offered when available, and if requested. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
IEPs are reviewed and teachers work on meeting the goals set therein.  Organizational and behavioral goal-setting play a 
substantial part in the instruction for some of these students.  Collaboration with the Special Education staff  is made in order 
to learn appropriate techniques for coping with handicapping conditions or emotional disorders that may impede academic 
success.  More scaffolding and direct teaching of vocabulary is used.  Instruction incorporates a variety of learning 
styles.  Otherwise, aside from accommodations that FELLs with IEPs receive as per their educational plans, modifications and 
instructional goals for the year, instruction parallels that given to Long-Term ELLs and Former ELLs. 
Students with disabilities are inter-classed with undisabled peers. The one student who spends one 40-minute period a week 
without her peers is the one 7th grade Intermediate-level student who is in a class with 7th grade Advanced students. Since 
she needs more ESL instructional time, she meets with the ESL teacher in addition to the 4 periods (180 minutes worth of class 
time) alone. What is an advantage for her is that she is in a self-contained class, and since she has been ESL, the grouping with 
higer performing students has allowed her to find her voice more, to participate more rigorously in class discussions and to 
find the assistance she needs to complete more in-class and homework assignments readily.    
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
IEPs are reviewed and teachers work on meeting the goals set therein.  Organizational and behavioral goal-setting play a

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
For now, one of our Special Education math instructors has kept the ESL instructor up-to-date with math vocabulary that is 
important to reinforce for the units taught so far. The school has also purchaseed Scholastic's Code-X textbooks: a standards-
based literary text that reeferences other disciplines.  
In addition, the school is still developing its intervention program for ELLs, especially with our growing ELL population. Ms. 
Kunnen, the Aussie consultant whose background is in ESL education, is now leading professional development workshops to 
engage all students, yet ELLs in particular as well.  
  
Once again, since the school's goal is to engage all students, ELLs included in classroom activities and discussion, there is more 
attention to lessons being scaffolded for department common planning as well as using and visuals, video, and realia being 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

incorporated for the effective roll-out of instruction.   
  
In ELL classroom discussion, the ELL instructor asks the student to make text-to-self connections, to share idiomatic 
expressions to develop a sense of community, to write journal entries in students' native language, to discuss content with 
other students who speak their native language in that language.  
In order to enable students to become self-reliant, bilingual dictionaries and content area glossaries are available in 
classrooms. Further, conferences with intructors are held on an on-need basis as well as communication by email 
  
Finally, the intervention program groups the lowest level of ELLs in the the school-wide 37.5 minute-extended day program. 
The students work on targeted areas of instruction as outlined by the ELA and math curricula, and again, they are grouped by 
level. Consequently, it is Beginner and Intermediate-level students who attend the ELL-guided extended day which meets from 
2:24 until 3:07 pm, from Monday through Thursday, and focuses on math and ELA in alternance on a weekly basis.   
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Title III funds provided the means to purchase software for the delivery of instruction to assist our newcomers, LTELLs and ELLs 
with disabilities across the disciplines. First, the Rigor Program provides instruction, practice and assessment while reinforcing 
mastery of critical skills. It focuses on the individual needs and desires of students, and so accommodates their different 
learning styles. The program targets Common Core Standards for both mathematics and language arts at all grade. Further, the 
SuccessMaker software differentiates reading and math instruction for students in grades K-12. It provides instruction, practice 
and assessment, focuses on students' needs, and accommodates their different learning styles. It is Common Core Standards-
based for Math and ELA. Finally, Cengage Learning Inc. is a workbook that provides fundamental vocabulary building and 
grammar exercises for Beginner ELLs.      
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs will be discontinued at this time. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Students audition for the school's perfoming Arts programs, and to the best of availability and their performance, can 
participate in the talent of their choice. In addition, all students are eligible to attend Long Island University's after school 
enrichment program, however many of our school's ELLs choose to participate in our instructor's enrichment program. The 
after school ESL tutoring takes place on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Yet, in the month of March, 
tutoring hours is extended so that they end at 5:30 p.m. The Tuesday and Thursday sessions are led by our ESL instructor who 
serves 2 to 8 students depending on student availability. The Saturday program begins at 9:00 a.m. and finishes at 1:00 p.m. 
The Saturday program is also be led by our sole ESL instructor who serves 8 students depending on student availability.  
  
During these programs, students read novels to build vocabulary, reading fluency and stamina. Many of the students need to 
participate in literature circles as they do not spend enough time reading at home, nor do they have someone to read with or 
who can engage them in critical thinking at home. Consequently, the ESL instructor will, first and foremost model reading 
fluency and fluidity during eachc tutoring session. Through modeling, she will teach the students pacing, she will teach how to 
let punctuation guide the reading of the text, and she will instruct how to give meaning to the text with inflections, emphasis 
on certain words and by means of activating the schema.  
  
After our ESL instructor models strong reading of literature in the literature circles, not only will students then practice reading 
aloud themselves, but as our ESL instructor has chosen high-interest novels, students will build an appetite for reading as, each 
session, they will feel the suspense of the plot movement and the reward of reading for pleasure during each tutoring session.  
  
In addition to reading, students will be instructed to decipher meaning of new vocabulary words from context clues. In 
addition, our English Language Learners will evaluate how the main idea of the novels used in the literature circles is 
developed, they will practice supporting claims with textual evidence, they will analyze and discern characters, they will ask 
questions (critical thinking) related to the author’s purpose, characterization, plot or text-domain vocabulary, they will engage 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

in making make text-to-text/text-to-self/text-to-world connections all to achieve this goal: to become more adept at literary 
analysis and response. If they can use prompts to discuss literature, this methodology will not only aid our ELLs in improving 
how they write to convey their understanding of the text, but in helping them to translate those verbal constructs into 
cohesive writing.  
  
In addition to participating in Common Core-Based reading tasks, our ELLs will explore cognates, antonyms and synonyms. 
They will also explore using all of the verb tenses: present perfect, past perfect, progressive, conditional and passive in order to 
make gains in their ability to execture grammatically polished writing.  
  
As speaking is an integral part of language acquisition, in order to guide students to use their conversation to increase their 
ability to speak academically, the literature circle will enable students to discuss and evaluate the important details of our 
reading. In addition, they will give their opinions about characterization, theme and central ideas. 
  
Aside from the literature circles, tutoring sessions will allow for students to strengthen grammatical skills and argumentative 
writing skills. Closer to April and May, students will prepare for the ELA, Math and NYSESLAT exams. All work will tackle NY 
State Common Core Standards of reading and writing. 
  
Finally, the Academic Zone is a program that is offered by Ms. Zan Taylor. She directs students for homework help, and then 
has the students participate in varied sports activities. There is no successs in sports without academic perseverance, hence 
the title of the program. The school also offers classes with Long Island University that are craft and recreationally based. The 
program is open to all students, yet our ESL instructor confers with the program leaders so that they are aware which ELLs 
attend.     
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Students are encouraged to use Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and/or the classroom computers that have the ESL instructors list 
of on-line leveled readers and instructional math and grammar games. In addtion, this year's Title III funds has incorporated 
the RIGOR program which is an interactive computer-based program.  
All of the ELA teachers also have leveled reading libraries.  
The House on Mango Street is used for the Beginner level students. How to Make Lemonade is used for the 8th grade 
Intermediate and Advanced level students. Divergent is used for the 7th grade Advanced and Intermediate level students. The 
6th grade Intermediate and Advanced level students are reading Stargirl. Non-fiction articles amended from The New York 
Times, Code-X is used with the Beginner level students. The technogy used is minimal ass students are now mandated to use 
IXL for math class and many of the students already have technology.  
Finally, the Aussie consultant, Ms. Kunnen and the network leader, Sharon Mahobir, are working closely with the Social 
Studies, Math and ELA departments to provide professional development sessions so that they can target the needs of low-
level students like ELLs, students with disabilities and ICT/SETTS students.   
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Students are permitted to conference in their native languages, to write journal entries in their native language, to read 
independently in their native language. Programming also has students grouped with at least one speaker of their native 
language.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required ESL services and resources are in alignment with students’ ages and grade levels.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52

level students like ELLs, students with disabilities and ICT/SETTS students.   
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ELLs are invited to our audition and orientation weekend sessions. Within the first weeks of school, bilingual 
support staff is made available and teachers monitor students to identify strengths and weaknesses so that students are 
appropriately placed in September, especially the ESL instructor. Newcomers are introduced to a buddy or, in some cases, 
students with severe needs are introduced to a group of ELLs or FELLs in the school who speak their native language. Students 
are also acquainted with the ESL instructor, their assistant principals, and where to find the ESL schedule on all four floors of 
the school building.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

MS113 is a performing Arts school, therefore, art, graphic Arts, theatre, dance, chorus and technology are all electives in which 
ELLs can choose to participate. These classes are Common-Core aligned, so reading and writing skills reinforce writing 
strategies learned in ELA and ESL classrooms and help to develop text-domain vocabulary as well as writing through across the 
content through hands-on learning and experiential education.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
1-2. Workshops in ESL methodology are offered through the network as a means of professional development days.  For 
example, our ESL teacher attends professional development with the ELA staffs so that she has an informed means of aligning 
instructional content or methodologies with the department members. In addition, she has attended how-to conferences for 
the delivery of instrucion for English Language Learners as well as how to use data to drive instruction for ELLs. In addition, 
teachers who confer or meet with our ESL instructo, on a needs-basis, receive informal training by the ESL teachers during 
some weekly departmental meetings. The ESL teachers also receive support in instruction and compliance issues from the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

network specialist and the administrative staff. Our ESL instructor also sends her data analysis to the entire staff so that that 
information can be used to inform her and the staff's instructional practices.  Conclusions from the data will be applied to 
similar populations which will result in an increase in differentiated instruction.  The goal of sharing this information is so that a 
greater number of ELL students can achieve academically, can develop academic language proficiency and, ulitmately 
transition out of our ESL program. 
  
Further, the school will be in contact with Mr. Joshua Metz, the ELL Compliance Specialist, in order to remain updated on 
professional development sessions that will inform the staff members of professional development for content-area teachers. 
For now, once again, the network specialist, Sharon Mahobir, and the Aussie Consultant, Ms. J. Kunnen, are working with staff 
members on a series of professional development sessions to help the MS113 staff realize the goals for academic 
improvement--as outlined by the chancellor--and there is a focus on group activities and scaffolding that will enable to ELLs, 
SETTS and ICT students as well as students with disability to achieve success as well as general education students.  
  
The ESL teacher, Ms Rabinowitz, has attended a meeting in November to review resources to help one of her newcomers. In 
addition, she has attended in October, a training on Code-X run by Scholastic, and in December, one led by the ELA assistant 
principal. She will also attend a final training on implementing this program on January 16. During the sessions, she exchanges 
information with other educators about how to make this rigorous text accessible to ELLs. In addition, Ms. Stinson, in 
September and January 10th  and January 13th, has attended meetings led by the ESL Compliance Specialists to get a training 
on Kinsella's approach to the explicit instruction of vocabulary, ESL tasks, ATS and new coordinators' responsiblities, and 
NYSITELL training. Finally, Ms. Stinson has communicated to the Office of LA Coordinators, that she is interested in attending 
any training available for a professional development conference about how to make sure translation and interpretation 
services are to be made available for the parents of ELLs. Within the upcoming months, our ESL insstructor will also attend any 
available training that is Common-Core based, based on writing and reading of informational texts or related to explicit ELL 
instruction.

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
3.               Our ESL instructor has developed an exit interview for her students and she has also has provided them with a list of 
how to get acquainted with their schools before they start the new school year. Eighth graders are also encouraged to inform 
themselves about the form of instruction (free-standing or pull-out, the ammenities available at the school, about mock 
Regents available, about after school or Saturday programs, course outlines and reading lists so that they can become more 
informed of the standards and expectations they must meet before the school year commences.  
  
The testing coordinator and assistant principal of compliance have also attended network-led and organized trainings specific 
testing of all students--ELLS included--and the services of ELLs and students with disabilities. The ELL instructor will also email 
the ESL compliance specialist to obtain information about content-are based trainings for content teachers of ELLs as well as 
for the guidance counselor and the parent coordinator Since the school is developing its ELL program, many of the specific 
activities and professional development for ELLs and specific to the education of ELLs or the parents of ELLs need to be 
established too.  
  
4. The assistant principal of compliance will have generated a list of teachers eligible for Jose P. training. This assistant 
principal, as well as the ELL instructor, will keep these names on file. Then, the attendance of Jose P. trainings will require that 
an attendance sheet will be signed as well as an evaluation form; both administration and the ELL coordinator will maintain 
those documents. Jose P. will be rendered to include a comprehensive overview of basic ESL key terms and programs. 
Teachers will have been provided with student profiles that are characteristic of the problems and strategies that should be

used for students at every ability level. Teachers will also have the ability to bring in their own lesson plans and teaching 
materials to work one-on-one with our ESL teacher to add modifications and to differentiate their materials for the ESL 
population.  
The Jose P. training will include, as always, profiles of different levels of ELLs--beginner, intermiate and advanced. The profiles 
will also include former ELLs and students with disabilities. The training will also include accommodations, testing rights for 
ELLs (glossaries, interpreters, dictionaries, extended time, eligibility) as well as promotional criteria of ELLs for the different 
grades levels: 6,7,8. Further, the training will include sessions on SIOP and tieir II and III instruction, the CALLA method, how to 
use prompts, word banks, sentence prompts vs. sentence strips as well as how to scaffold to make performance tasks, and 
lessons overall more comprehensible. Finally, the last session will involve teachers bringing in lessons and exams to make sure 
that testing and lessons being differentiated is put into practicce effectively. 
  
Tentative dates are February 3, February 11, March 12, March 19 and June 11 and June 18.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The school is currently establishing its programs for parent involvement. It has only been since last year that there has been a 
full-time ESL teacher. So, for those reasons, the school is still developing means of fostering parental involvement for parents 
of ELLs. For now, the ELL instructor has contacted the LA Coordinator office in order to get information about translation and 
interpretation services. In addition, the school is still developing its means to incorporate to its parents in school-wide activities 
and in activities for the parents of students. For now, we have tried to make sure tha the ELL instructor is notified of calendar 
events in advance so that flyers, memos, letters home and other documents can be translated as expediently as possible and 
in due time. 
  
The notification of students entitled and no longer entitled to ESL services is given within the first weeks of school. The dates 
of the NYSESLAT exam, the right to testing accommodations and HLIS forms are all given to parents in a timely manner (at least 
a month in advance or as soon as the student enters the building if newly enrolled.  
  
All communications of programming, testing, invitations to school events and enrichment programs are sent to the homes in 
English as well as Arabic, Bengali, French and Spanish.  Parents are welcome to visit classes and to make appointments with 
the ESL instructor to discuss academic performance and achievement. In addition, during Curriculum Night parents can 
become aware of the academic expectations of teachers school-wide, they can get acquainted with teachers and materials

used in the classroom as well as online resources that teachers find useful as ancillary learning materials. During Performing 
Arts Night, guardians are invited to see how the Arts are used to engage, to instruct and to help the whole child develop, 
especially ELLs and students with needs. Aside from parent conferences, there are parent outreach meetings to acquaint 
parents with the high school application process and graduation. All of these engagement activities provide parents with 
diverse opportunities to get better acquainted with the MS 113 school environment as a learning community and to see to 
how the needs of their ELL children are met.  In addition, we have two bilingual paraprofessionals to assist students and 
families.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dawnique Daughtry, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

First, the ATS report of languages spoken of students who make up our ESL population is generated in the 
beginning of the year and kept of file with the ESL coordinator. Secondly, the HLIS and parent interview is an 
indicatoin of the need for translation services or interpretation services. Finally, the ESL teacher, Ms. Stinson also 
conducts and informal survey with students, within the first weeks of school, of how much assistance the parents 
need for oral and written translation.  

In addition, the language spoken at home is also included on the emergency card kept on file in the school's main 
office.  

For testing and ESL-related information, all communication is available in translation as it is sent to the DOE 
translation service well in advance so that the information can be disseminated to parents in a timely fashion. For 
last-minute informational sessions or events, the ESL teacher explains all information to students so that they can

translate the information to their parents. Finally, the bilingual Spanish-speaking and Bengali-speaking parents are 
always available to assist with phone calls home.  

The school is developing its translation services, however, the ESL teacher has explained how documents can be 
translated in a timely fashion, and the universal need for attention to this detail is constantly iterated by her 
during school-wide meetings, especially when testing and notices of testing are concerned. The availabilty of 
grading codes in the languages of ours students for parent-teacher conferences, the availability of dictionaries and 
glossaries also makes it evident for staff that there is a need for translation and interpretation for our ELLs and 
their parents.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

The majority of our ELL's

and written 
communication is English. 
In addition, Spanish and 
Bengali are requested for 
some students. We are 
fortunate to have a Bengali 
speaking and Spanish 
Speaking para professional 
at our school who assist in 
all written and oral 
communication in the 
requested languages at our 
school. If new students 
should enter throughout 
the year we will work with 
the translation services as 
well as other staff member 
s to assist the specific oral 
and written 
communication needs of 
our parents.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.

Our school disseminates a variety of 
documents each year in the students 
native language. We have preordered a 
series of High School directories in the 
various languages at our school to hand 
out to our 8 th grade students. All 
correspondences involving high school 
meetings, parent meetings, conference 
and exam announcements are 
prepared and given in the languages 
requested. The ESL teacher, creates 
materials each year depending on the 
languages and sends home testing data, 
family resources, academic assistance 
and letters regarding school leadership. 
In addition, we utilize our bilingual staff 
to follow up in case parents have any 
additional questions or concerns. In 
addition, we have set up the report 
cards, to enable comments to be 
received in the students native 
language to better assist the parents in 
addressing their students needs. Parent 
Teacher conferences have full time 
people available with sign up sheets to 
ensure that every parent has access to 
a translator for the duration of the 
meetings. Additional meetings are also 
organized with on staff translators 
when requested.  

   

 

2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as

guardians that they can call the school 
and ask for her for assistance, she 
speaks to the students and informs 
them of her schedule and how to 
locate her if they need her and she 
visits the ESL classroom from time to 
time. The bilingual Spanish 
paraprofessional is not the only 
Spanish-speaking adult who can help 
with oral interpretation. There is a 
para-professional who is is French and 
Spanish-speaking. She assists, just as 
the Bengali-speaking paraprofessional 
does, with oral interpretation once 
new students come in the building, to 
translate informational brochures or 
flyers, to sit in on IEP meetings or 
simply to interpret school-related 
items or the progress of students on 
our staff members' behalf. The paras 
are made available for any meeting 
that the parent needs. Our translators 
assist for the full duration of 
parent/teacher conferences, parent 
engagement and meetings with the 
guidance counselor, psychologist or 
deans.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school has created a parent survey to gather feedback from the parents on the quality and availability of the 
services. The survey will be handed out at the next meeting and follow up for the questions will also be obtained by 
utilizing the our para professionals to call the parents. In speaking with the parents directly many have expressed 
positive feedback in the availability of services. We have noticed and are working on the need to obtain blue cards in 
the parents native language going forward. If any additional feedback arises we will address it immediately. We will 
continue to solicit feedback when meeting with the families of ELLS throughout the year.
