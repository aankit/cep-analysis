Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our Mission is to prepare students for post-secondary education and to compete in the global economy through a 
challenging academic curriculum, including 21st Century skills, such as financial and digital literacy, collaboration, and 
entrepreneurship. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The theme of finance is infused into coursework through interdisciplinary curriculum and project-based learning. 
Major projects include presentations to build professional skills, research projects, and business plans. Our Finance 
and Business curriculum is provided by the National Academy Foundation (NAF) and is aligned to industry standards. 
Students build a portfolio of their learning and development of their professional identity through their four years in 
the school culminating in a presentation to a panel prior to graduation. Students are also exposed to college and 
careers, with an emphasis on degree programs in business and finance. Classroom instruction incorporates culturally 
relevant practices, including curricula and pedagogical strategies to account for all learners. 

We collaborate with the National Academy Foundation (NAF) and other industry partners to provide real-world 
business experience including job shadowing, guest speakers, workshops, industry trips and paid internships. NAF 
Certified Graduates are eligible for NAFTrack Certified Hiring with a variety of NAF partners, including AT&T, Cisco, 
EMC, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Juniper Networks, KPMG LLP, RBC Capital Markets US, Verizon and Xerox. We have 
partnerships with several post-secondary institutions, including LIU-Brooklyn, Medgar Evers, Kingsborough 
Community College, St. Francis, St. Joseph's, and City Tech to provide College Now courses, SAT Prep, transitional 
workshops, mentoring, and a variety of other programs and college experiences. Our Pencil partner is JP Morgan 
Chase, and we have formed new partnerships with Accenture, Santander, and WISE Financial. We are also part of the 
Lenovo Scholar Network, a nationwide mobile app development program for selected NAF Academies. Students 
participated in a national competition to create mobile apps.  

 

We have expanded our CTE offerings to include a technology sequence. We offer Microsoft Certifications as part of 
the Microsoft Imagine Academy Cohort, as well as AP Computer Science.  

 

We are part of the following Equity & Excellence Initiatives: AP for ALL (Year Two), College Access for ALL (Year 
Two), and Algebra for ALL (Year One) 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Approximately 27% SWDs - primarily ICT and mandated counseling support. We have a small ELL population, primarily 
Arabic-speaking students. The majority of our students are Level 1s based on 8th grade test scores in ELA and Math. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Based on the data from the Learning Environment Survey, we made significant progress in Supportive Environment 
and Strong Family-Community Ties. Based on the Learning Environment Survey and other data points, our key area of 
focus for 2018-2019 will be Rigorous Instruction.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
LES Data indicates a decline in Rigorous Instruction. Rigorous Instruction will continue to be a priority for 2018-2019 
as we continue to move towards implementing Project-Based Learning across all courses, as well as continuing to 
support literacy skill building in the areas of reading comprehension and argumentative writing. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, teachers will engage students in authentic learning experiences across all courses, as measured by a 5% 
increase in ELA Regents Pass Rates.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers will plan and implement units of study utilizing the 
Understanding by Design model and authentic problem-based 
performance tasks as summative assessments. One PD session 
each month will be dedicated to planning and reviewing units of 
study and performance tasks to ensure tighter alignment to ESSA 
Standards. Entry points and targeted instructional adjustments 
for all students, including SWDs and ELLs, will be included in Unit 
Plans. 

Teachers will work with an ASCD Consultant individually and in 
small groups to plan and implement units of study and 
performance tasks. Consultant will conduct classroom 
observations and model instructional strategies as needed to 
support implementation.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

LES Data indicates a decline in Collaborative Teachers. Advance Observation Data indicates Domain 3 still needs to be 
strengthened across the school. Observation data shows that teachers do not consistently score Effective or HE in 
Domain 3 Components. This goal will focus on continuing to develop effective instructional strategies that can be 
implemented school wide, with a focus on 3b Questioning and Discussion to increase student voice and authentic 
engagement in the classroom.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will have engaged in collaborative planning activities, including Instructional Rounds, to 
support implementation of instructional strategies to support Project-Based Learning and authentic Performance Tasks, 
as measured by a 5% increase in ELA Regents pass rates.

impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers will create a "toolkit" of best practices by participating 
in specific PD sessions as outlined in our PD Calendar. There will 
be a greater focus on PD to support strategies aligned to 3b 
Questioning and Discussion and 3d, specifically formative 
assessment and targeted feedback to students. A PD Evaluation 
Form through Google Docs will be completed by each teacher 
after each PD session to gauge effectiveness of PD sessions. 

Teachers will participate in Learning Walks with a particular area 
of focus to observe best practices in action. Teams will be 
identified based on common areas for growth as identified 
during observations.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

LES Data indicates a decrease in Effective School Leadership. This goal will continue to address building capacity of 
teacher leaders to take greater ownership over their teams and roles within the school community, as well as support 
the STEM and Humanities teams in building the capacity of their members. We did not meet this goal for 2017-2018, 
and have had a number of staffing changes for the 2018-2019 school year, so this goal will remain a focus. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, all Teacher Leaders will facilitate all team meetings and prepare agendas and resources for team 
meetings as measured by observation of team meetings and internal Google Drive (notes from team meetings, agendas, 
resources, etc.) resulting in consistency of instructional practices across the school.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teacher leaders will continue to engage in PD provided by the 
Principal to enhance facilitation skills, specifically around 
implementing PDSA Cycles (Plan, Do, Study, Act). Growth will be 
measured by observation of Teacher leaders facilitating team 
meetings. 

Teacher leaders will promote shared decision making in their 
respective teams through rotation of roles and assignments. 
Team Google Docs and observations of team meetings will be 
used to monitor progress and growth.  

Teacher leaders will model facilitation skills for their colleagues 
to continue to build capacity within each teacher team. Team 
Google Docs and observations of team meetings will be used to 
monitor progress and growth of team members and leaders. 

Teachers will engage in cycles of data analysis, including student 
work and assessment data, to plan targeted interventions and 
data driven instruction. Instructional rounds will be conducted to 
support implementation.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Learning Environment Survey response rate for parents increased from 23% to 44%.  

Parents continue to be responsive on an individual basis in our school community, but we will continue to try to 
increase the collective parent voice and encourage greater attendance rates at school events to get a more accurate 
picture of parents’ perception and level of satisfaction, as well as engage parents in decision-making at the school 
level. Attendance rates at events continued to increase during 2018-2019 school year, so this goal will continue our 
focus on making parents more active as partners in the school community and engaging them more deeply in our 
work. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, we will increase parent and community engagement in our school community through parents and 
community members participating in at least two Project-Based service learning projects in the community and a 10% 
increase in parent participation in school events, workshops, PTA meetings, student activities, guidance workshops (ie. 
FAFSA Night), and parent-teacher conferences measured by parent attendance compared to 2018-2019.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32 

 

achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Brooklyn Academy of Global Finance, in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Brooklyn Academy of Global Finance will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35

children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events;

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
CS strategy is complementary to the academic instruction at Brooklyn Academy of Global Finance. Our subcontracted 
community partners provide a balance between tutoring and academic support during and after school, as well as 
leadership and advocacy skill building to support students taking greater ownership of their own learning. In 
partnership with our lead CBO, targeted academic interventions are provided during the school day and after school. 
All 9th graders participate in small group advisory. All 10th, 11th, and 12th graders develop post-secondary and career 
plans. Our partnerships are also increasing the number of internships available to 12th grade students helping them 
make stronger connections between academics and careers. 

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   

1.  Attendance Supports (Effective Leadership): BAGF will utilize the Student Success Team to identify student 

needs, assign supports and interventions, track student progress and celebrate growth resulting in a 2% 
attendance increase by June 2019 as compared to 2017-18. 

2.  Health and Wellness (Supportive Environment): BAGF will use mentoring (Success Mentoring and Peer Group 

Connection) and our partnership with BCP to build a supportive environment where students are known by 
name, individually supported and partners in creating a caring and safe environment resulting a decrease of 
students identified as chronically absent by 3% by June 2019 as compared to 2017-18. 

3.  Extended Learning Time (Rigorous Instruction): BAGF will partner with The Leadership Program, I Will 

Graduate, Triad and additional partners TBD to provide extended learning opportunities for students resulting 
in an increase of the number of 9th graders on-track for graduation from 73% (2017-18) to 80% by June 2019.  

4.  Family Engagement (Strong Family-Community Ties): By June 2019, parent participation in school events, 

workshops, PTA meetings, student activities, guidance workshops, and parent-teacher conferences will 
increase 10% as measured by parent attendance compared to 2017-2018. 

5.  Professional Development (Collaborative Teachers): By June 2019, 80% of teachers will have participated in at 
least 3 inter-visitations (instructional rounds) and provided feedback on best strategies in one of the following 
areas: Project-based learning (PBL) or Culturally Relevant Pedagogy. CSS will provide coaching and

Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and 
together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will 
lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work. 

1. The full-time Community School Director (CSD) was hired in partnership with school leadership and the SLT. The 
CSD is responsible for the day-to-day management of the community school strategy. The CSD is a "community 
organizer,” facilitating and providing leadership for the collaborative process of developing a continuum of services 
for children, families, and community members. The CSD drives development of community school action plans and 
planning for sustainability. The CSD tracks the school’s progress against performance goals, reviews school data, 
supports program evaluation activities, and manages partnerships. The CSD will ensure that the community school 
strategy is implemented at exceptional levels of quality with full support, buy-in, and regular communication with 
stakeholders across the school community. Specific position responsibilities will include: 

• Build and maintain relationships with administration, faculty, staff, students, parents, and community partners 

• Organize and expand upon the membership of the Community School Team (CST) to include diverse school 
community stakeholders and CBOs 

• Conduct a needs assessment process, including: reviewing school and student-level data; conducting focus groups 
with parents, students, faculty, staff, administrators, and community partners; and reviewing and/or conducting 
school climate and culture survey at key times throughout the school year to inform continuous improvement 

• Conduct a community asset assessment to identify viable partnerships that can meet the needs of students and 
families of the school community, including ongoing partnership evaluation 

• Recruit and develop partnership agreements with people and community organizations willing to offer programs 
and services for students and families at the school in accordance with identified needs 

• Identify evidence and research-based practices and/or partnerships that address priority areas for the community 
school strategy, which may include but are not limited to: Parent/Family Engagement; Community Engagement; 
Youth Development; Academic Rigor and Instructional Practices; Health and Mental Health; Tutoring; After school 
programming; and Mentoring 

• Develop, maintain, and publicize a schedule of programs and activities offered at the school 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

• Implement and maintain a process that encourages referrals to programs and services offered at the school 

• Identify needs of chronically absent students, apply interventions, and track and monitor impact of interventions on 
weekly basis, as part of weekly Student Success Summit 

• Collect and monitor program implementation data and student data for each partnership that allow easy data 
analysis and interaction by the SLT, CST, and other school stakeholders

  The Student Sorter will be used on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis to identify and connect students (both 

subgroups and individuals) in need of personalized/individualized supports. Prevention initiatives and 
intervention initiatives will be tracked in the Student Sorter and this data will be analyzed regularly, in 
partnership with the CST and other key school stakeholders, to evaluate effectiveness and to implement new 
strategies as needed. 
Streamlined referral processes with BCP will be implemented to ensure that school stakeholders know when 
and how to refer students and families in need of additional personalized supports that emerge throughout 
the school year. A tracking tool will also provide a way to ensure that referrals are followed up on and that 
services are delivered in accordance with the needs presented. 

 

  Partner programs will collaborate with teachers and others involved in instructional programming and regular 

points of engagement will be implemented throughout the year to ensure a cohesive instructional approach 
within and outside of the regular school day. Two examples include: 

o  Through Peer Group Connection (PGC), 12th grade peer leaders will facilitate a “Faculty Outreach” in 

which the faculty experience for themselves the PGC program. Through this experience, faculty will 
become more knowledgeable about PGC and become better equipped to bring practices from the 
program into their classroom. 

o  Through Success Mentoring, mentors will regularly connect with teachers to learn about how their 

mentees are performing in class. Through this weekly interaction, teachers will also learn more about 
the work of mentors and mentees and how they can support this work in their classroom. 

In partnership with the principal, the CSD will form and subsequently convene monthly meetings of a Community 
School Team (CST) whose membership will include: members of the School Leadership Team (SLT), other key school 
staff and/or faculty, key staff from other partner CBOs, parents, and students. Through this meeting, issues will be 
regularly communicated to and discussed by the group. An annual Community School Forum will engage parents in 
authentic discussion to learn about the community school strategy and provide feedback on areas of success and 
areas for improvement. Surveys and focus groups with parents will also be held at key times throughout the school 
year to inform continuous improvement. 

 

The CSD will also work with the Parent Coordinator and identified parent leaders to define and implement strategic 
initiatives to better engage parents in their child’s education and support the community school. Planned initiatives 
designed to support authentic parent engagement include: 

  Kinvolved -- real-time attendance tracking and text messaging to parents from teachers and other school 

staff, designed to provide real-time, actionable information to parents about their child’s progress and open 
up lines of communication between parents and teachers. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

  Parent resource room -- an open, welcoming space where families are invited to learn about and take 

advantage of resources available in the school community. 

  PGC Family Night -- 9th grade parents are welcomed to an evening event facilitated by student peer leaders 

designed to help parents learn more about PGC, learn more about their child’s experience transitioning to 
middle school, and to dialogue with other parents about their own challenges supporting their child’s 
transition to high school. 

  Monthly positive parent outreach -- parents of Success Mentoring mentees will receive specific positive 

progress updates from mentors on at least a monthly basis. 

 

 

4.  

The principal, CSD and other members of the Student Success Team will meet for one period on a 

weekly basis to review the Student Sorter, using the meeting agenda protocol recommended by 

NYCDOE. During this meeting, the team will review attendance trends and specific student cases to  

identify and implement next steps and interventions. If questions arise about Student Sorter data, the  

CSD will serve as the school’s liaison to New Visions’ to address questions and build capacity within  

the school around Student Sorter proficiency.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We refer to various sources to assess our ELLs' literacy skills, including, when available, ATS reports of students' previous test 
results and previous report cards/transcripts/school information. For students not new to our school, we consult with their 
former teachers, and the ENL teacher assesses students informally at the beginning of the year for oral and reading 
comprehension, and writing ability.  Previous NYSESLAT proficiency levels, when available, are used to group students and to 
plan for pull-out/push-in ESL instruction.  For example, at the start of school year 2017-2018, the ENL teacher used the RELC to 
group students and plan push-in periods. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

Inquiry teams review student assessment data on a weekly basis to plan interventions.  Progress is monitored and 
interventions adjusted as necessary based on the data. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We measure our success by the results on classroom and Regents exams, the annual NYSESLAT, and student performance in 
the content-area classes, as seen on report cards, portfolio work, class participation and assignments, and in teacher 
consultations.  We use scholarship data from STARS to evaluate progress in individual courses.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Inquiry teams review student assessment data on a weekly basis to plan interventions.  Progress is monitored and 
interventions adjusted as necessary based on the data. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
At the high school level, we notice data patterns across proficiency levels, and not across grades.  Newly arrived ELLs typically 
progress faster in listening and speaking than in reading and writing modalities, and this is what we've seen on our NYSESLAT 
results.  All of our students scored at a higher level of proficiency on L/S than on R/W. Data patterns on the NYSESLAT show 
the most significant growth in Listening Scores.  Writing scores remain static and there is some increase in Reading but not of 
significance. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Inquiry teams review student assessment data on a weekly basis to plan interventions.  Progress is monitored and 
interventions adjusted as necessary based on the data. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

ENL instruction is delivered using a responsive, flexible approach that combines push-in and pull-out sessions.  Our 
ENL teacher is only here part-time to work with our few (12) ELL students.  Before the start of each semester, she 
consults with the principal and programmer to help ensure that scheduling the beginning level ELLs is done in such a 
way as to maximize her time with them.  
We have too few ELLs to constitute a full class.  The groups are hetergeneous (mixed proficiency levels) in theory and 
homogeneous in actuality in proficiency levels.  We try to program the beginning ELLs into the same classes for math, 
science, and history.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

              We utilize the Integrated ENL model with the ENL teacher and ELA teacher co-teaching.  The ENL teacher's program is 
designed based on student need.  The students are programmed based on their grade level and credit needs, and the ENL 
teacher then structures her push-in and pull-out schedule based on individual student needs.  For example, she may only need 
to push-in to one ELA period to service an Expanding ENL, whereas an Emerging ENL requires the ENL teacher to schedule an 
additional period of service.  Emerging students are programmed for additional time with the ENL teacher. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
      Core content is delivered in English.  Instructional approaches includes targeted interventions, co-teaching, collaborative 
groups, and project-based learning. Students also receive vocabulary and glossaries to support language acquisition.  Scaffolds, 
such as graphic organizers, are used to support instruction as needed. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

      Benchmark assessments that have been translated into the home languages are given by teachers. NYC Performance 
Assessments, Mock Regents exams and teacher-created assessments are used to measure progress.  Individually tailored 
assessments may also be given to measure effectiveness of targeted interventions and modify instructional strategies. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Targeted interventions and differentiated activities are given based on student need. Level of text are differentiated for each 
of the ELL subgroups.  Writing tasks are also differentiated based on the ELL subgroups.  For example, a SIFE student may be 
given oral instructions as well as written instructions for tasks.  One-to-one direct instructional support is varied based on level 
within subgroup as well. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Heterogeneous grouping, scaffolds, and targeted intervention strategies are used.  The grade-level materials may be modified 
based on individual student need; for example, an alternate reading passage on the same content may be used for an acitivty 
based on reading ability.  Core Curriculum is used in ELA and Math, and DOE scope and sequence along with materials from 
EngageNY are used in Science and Social Studies. Additional vocabulary instruction may be used to accelerate language 
acquisition.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Students are programmed individually according to their IEP program recommendations to maximize their ability to achieve 
annual goals and attain English proficiency.  Students may also be programmed for additional AIS after school and Saturdays as 
necessary. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

Intervention services are offered primarily in English, with minimal assistance in French and Spanish (generally for quick 
vocabulary support). As a school community, we are working to provide more outreach to students who have been ELLs from 
4-6 years and to Long Term ELLs, with the constraints of having only a parttime ENL program.  Intervention programs are 
offered within the content area classes.  Content area teachers receive training in specific literacy and writing strategies that 
foster language development.  These strategies include SQ3R, concept mapping, journaling, growing word walls, read alouds, 
morphemic analysis, paraphrasing, and use of the Cornell Note-Taking method.  In social studies, the teachers often 
supplement traditional text books with additional materials, including online sources..  In English, texts are selected with ELL 
student needs in mind.  Students are often given a choice of books to read for a themed-unit. In Math, written notes may be 
translated and one-to-one direct instructional support is given during the class as well as during tutoring sessions.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are not planning to change the ENL program for next year, unless our demographics change and we enroll many more 
ELLs. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No ELL programs/services will be discontinued. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded the same access to all school programs and activities as non-ELL students.  ELLs students are programmed for 
AP for ALL courses and CTE sequence along with all students in the school.  Information about afterschool programs is sent 
home in both English and translations, and parent/guardian signatures are required of all students.      
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
When available, translated materials, both print and online, are used to support ELLs in classrooms.   Teachers also 
differentiate their lessons with considerable scaffolding, graphic organizers, and activities presenting the same content in 
different ways to meet the needs of all learners.  ELL students are provided iPads with access to resources such as Rosetta 
Stone to support their language acquisition. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

When available, content area subject teachers keep related print materials in different languages in their classrooms, such as 
glossaries, practice tests, and study books, in different native languages.                
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All our ELLs, including our SIFE students, are in mainstream classes, where the activities are grade-level appropriate with 
support.  Common Core ELA skills are emphasized across the curricula, corresponding to students' ages and grade levels.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
When available, translated materials, both print and online, are used to support ELLs in classrooms.   Teachers also 
differentiate their lessons with considerable scaffolding, graphic organizers, and activities presenting the same content in 
different ways to meet the needs of all learners.     
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our ENL instructor participates in the freshman orientation held before the beginning of the school year.  ELL students' writing 
samples are collected and evaluated, and informal interviews are held with the incoming ELL students. 
When new ELLs enroll during the school  year, they would be closely monitored by our staff, including our guidance counselor, 
ENL teacher, administrators and teachers. The Parent Coordinator hosts the ELL Orientation, as well as additional parent 
workshops specific to needs of ELL students and parents. Students are assigned peer mentors to provide transitional social-

emotional support. If additional ENL instructional time would be helpful, or necessary, we make the requisite programmatic 
changes.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We offer Spanish as a foreign language. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
  
1. The ENL teacher may attend a variety of off-site workshops and turn key the information to staff members.  Teachers in all 
subject areas work with ELL students and will have an opportunity to participate in the professional development.  Additional 
workshops will be presented to staff members during PD days (All Mondays over course of school year, and Staff Development 
Days in November and January). As we only have a staff of twelve teachers, all workshops are conducted with all content areas 
in mind and focus mainly on instructional strategies.  Teachers then work within their content areas to apply instructional 
strategies and plan instructional activities and support for all students. 
Workshops may include: scaffolding, literacy development skills, aligning curricula with CCLS and evaluating that curricula, 
differentiation strategies. Teachers participate in a Book Club where reading strategies and text-bsed protocols are modeled 
and practiced.  Teachers also participate in lesson plan studies where they discuss instructional materials and 
strategies.  Teachers participate in training for literacy instruction baed on identified areas of skill gaps.  Training includes 
modeling and application of various strategies to support literacy skill development.  Teachers use Tri-State rubric to evaluate 
alignment of curricula and tasks to CCLS.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Staff participates in PD to discuss strategies to transition all students from middle to high school, including participating in 
activities that all 9  th   grade students will participate in during their advisory program. 
School wide professional development plans include daily common planning periods where classroom teachers share lessons 
and strategies on differentiation, data-driven instruction, and Common Core Learning Standards.  Teachers will submit 
common planning notes to the principal.  The ENL teacher and other teachers may also attend seminars and conferences 
offered by BETAC (the Bilingual Education Technical Assistance Center) and the DOE Office of English Language Learners which 
are held throughout the school year.   These include workshops on the following topics:  Teaching and Learning Strategies for 
English Language Learners with Disabilities, The Education of English Language Learners, and Differentiating Instruction: 
English Language Learners in the Mainstream Classroom, principles of Differentiated Instruction for ELL students in the 
mainstream classroom, as well as workshops related to compliance issues, such as understanding AMAOs.  These workshops 
are free and are conducted during the school day.  Attendance certificates, agendas and a list of resources will be kept on file 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Meetings are scheduled for individual parent on an ongoing basis during the student lunch period when all teachers are 
available to meet, as well as during the parent engagement time.  The guidance counselor meets with all parents of Seniors at 
the beginning of the school year to discuss progress and post-secondary plans.  Translation services may be provided as 
necessary, but are usually done in-house. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parent workshops organized and faciliated by the Parent Coordinator are offered for parents of ELLs to provide information on 
school activities, graduation requirements, services offered in the community, etc.  Parent involvement for all students is low 
in the school, but parents of ELL students do tend to participate in on-site meetings at a slightly higher level than non-ELL 
students. Parent Coordinator conducts outreach to notify parents and also identifies resources in the community that should 
be shared with parents of ELL students.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dannielle Darbee, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We use reports from ATS to identify home language for parents We also use surveys given during parent-teacher 
conferences, PTA /SLT meetings, and other family functions to obtain information regarding parents' preferred 
language of communication. When we receive new admits, we speak with the parent/guardian to determine 
preferred language. Blue cards are updated for all students on an annual basis, (in addition to an as-needed basis 
throughout the year individually). Information is reviewed to update any changes in language preference.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
