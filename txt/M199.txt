Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

We are committed to teaching our children to be respectful of others. Our mission is fourfold: (1) To teach children to 
become lifelong readers, writers and learners (2) To teach children to organize for effort, strive for high standards, 
and appreciate the need for understanding and tolerance in our diverse world (3) To create a strong community of 
pedagogues, administrators and parents who will work together to meet our common goals (4) To encourage 
flexibility and commitment on the part of the staff so that collaboration and team planning will optimize delivery of 
instruction. Our motto is “Work Hard, Be Kind.”

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
PS 199 is a kindergarten through fifth grade elementary school which also has one special education ACES program for 
students in grades 3-5 and an Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) class on each grade level. PS 199 was designated as a Blue 
Ribbon school in 2013 and has continued to be a school with a Good Standing designation. In January of 2018 as a 
result of state data we were deemed a Reward School . 2018 NYS test data indicates 85 % of students meeting or 
exceeding standards in English Language Arts. 2018 NYS math test data indicates 90% of students meeting or 
exceeding standards in Math.  

 

We believe that learning is a social and active process: students turn and talk, have purposeful partnerships, and 
instruction is geared towards fostering their continued growth. Our teachers engage in professional development and 
work with various establishments including Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and G&R Inclusive group. 
Professional development topics are decided upon collaboratively by our professional development team, grade level 
teams, and the administration. Our support of distributive leadership practices among our staff and families results in 
a collaborative environment.  

 

We have a long standing partnership with Columbia University Teachers College and provide our staff with continuous 
professional development that is aligned to the needs of teachers and students. The Teachers College Reading and 
Writing curriculum enables students to work at their independent levels in reading and writing. Assessments occur 
throughout each unit and students have the opportunity to assess their own work through student checklists and 
learning progressions. We utilize the Everyday Math Curriculum and our teachers meet regularly to preview lessons 
and adapt the curriculum to meet the needs of our learners. G&R Inclusive Group tailors professional development 
for our ICT teams with the continuous focus that our students with IEPs will have access to the general education 
curriculum. We pride ourselves that our teams work to utilize the six co-teaching models-one teach/one observe, 
station teaching, parallel teaching, alternative teaching, teaming, and one teach/one assist as it pertains to the direct 
needs of the students. This approach ensures the close monitoring of all students in the class and results in purposeful 
and targeted instruction.  

 

Our upper grade students serve as mentors to our students with learning differences. In addition, we believe in 
inclusive practices and seek out opportunities to include all our learners in all programs. We believe that students 
should have the opportunity to express their talents in many areas and we make a strong effort to incorporate the 
arts and sciences into our curriculum. We have partnerships with several organizations including New York 
Philharmonic, National Dance Institute, Wingspan, and Center for Architecture to accomplish this vision. In science we 
are focusing on teaching students about sustainability by studying plants and animals systems and are utilizing the 
curriculum created by NY Sun Works. Beginning September 2018 we will be implementing the new science state 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

standards through the Amplify Science Curriculum. We have designated resources to provide all our students the 
opportunity to work in a science lab on a weekly basis. Students in grades four and five receive two periods a week in 
our science center. We believe that a focus on science will enable all students to move towards college and career 
readiness as it introduces students to a range of careers in this field.  

 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

ACES special education class ( Grades 3-5) which serves students with intellectual disabilities. We presently have an 
ICT class on each grade level.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

A performance rating of Well-Developed was earned on four out of five areas on our 2015-2016 Quality Review. Areas 
of strength include: rigorous, engaging and coherent curricula aligned to CCLS; research-based effective instruction; 
aligned resources to support students’ needs and instructional goals; alignment of assessments to curricula; and 
purposeful support and evaluation of teachers. The 2015-2016 Quality Review indicated an area of proficient in 
partnering with families to ensure they understand how to support their children's progress toward college and 
career readiness. This indicator was discussed in depth during SLT meetings and this past academic year a survey was 
created by the SLT to gather additional data. Improving educational partnerships with families will continue to be a 
goal for the current school year. One means in which this is accomplished is by working with our family committees 
and involving our students in this work. For example, our Community Cares Committee has several initiatives 
throughout the year in which we have involved our students. Students for instance are made aware of the issue of 
homelessness in NYC and are asked to help advocate and support these families in need.  

A school wide goal was implementing the Passport Social Studies Curriculum and we have seen much success in 
coherence of this curriculum throughout the grades. Grade level teams spent time analyzing the curriculum and 
creating teaching and student resources. Another success, has been the increase in the number of K-2 students 
reading above grade level. This past academic year 2nd grade successfully implemented the Fundations curriculum. 
All students in grades K-2 are taught Fundations as a reading and word study curriculum. Fundations is a systematic 
phonetic program which is preventive and benefits students both in reading and writing. Our strong Academic 
Intervention Team is preventive in it's approach by analyzing reading and math data on a regular basis. Students are 
pulled for small group intervention and also receive direct instruction by learning specialists within the classroom.  

June 2018 MOSL data indicates that 90% of students are reading at or above grade level. Since the start of 
implementing Fundations we have seen a significant increase in students exceeding benchmarks in grades K-2. In 
addition, NYS ELA data also indicates that 85% of students are meeting or exceeding state standards. However, 2018 
fourth grade MOSL reading data indicates that nearly 17% of students are reading below satisfactory grade level 
benchmarks. This is on average nearly ten percent higher than in grades third and fifth. NYS ELA data also supports 
that target reading instruction is required on this grade level. Although, significant growth was seen in three 
consecutive years in grades third and fifth this is not the case for grade four as scores have remained relatively 
consistent. Fifty percent of these students not meeting benchmarks are students with IEPs. Academic intervention

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
90% of students are reading at or above grade level. Since the start of implementing Fundations we have seen a 
significant increase in students exceeding benchmarks in grades K-2. In addition, NYS ELA data also indicates that 85% 
of students are meeting or exceeding state standards. In grade 3 and in grade 5 nearly 94% of students are meeting or 
exceeding reading benchmarks. However, June 2018 fourth grade MOSL reading data indicates that only 82% of 
students are meeting or exceeding grade reading benchmarks. Nearly 11% of this fourth grade cohort were only one 
level below further validating that targeted intervention is required on the reading bands of P, Q, and R. NYS ELA data 
also supports that targeted reading instruction is required on this grade level. Although, significant growth was seen 
in three consecutive years in grades third and fifth this is not the case for grade four as scores has remained relatively 
consistent. Fifty percent of these students not meeting benchmarks are students with IEPs. Academic intervention 
services focused on reading support for students on this band level is required in fourth grade. In addition, our AIS 
team will provide reading intervention to these students moving to fifth grade.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 By June 2019, with implementation of targeted reading intervention fourth grade MOSL benchmarks will indicate that 
at least 90% of students are meeting or exceeding benchmarks.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
The 2018 Framework for Great Schools Report indicated a 4.26 rating in the area of supportive environment. Results 
from the 2015-2016 Quality Review indicated a rating of “well developed” in fostering teacher pedagogy from a 
coherent set of beliefs in regards to how students learn best. The 2018 Principal Performance Review also indicated a 
score of Well Developed in the area of Learning Environment.  

PS 199 embraces a balanced learning environment and incorporates the arts at every grade level. We have 
longstanding partnerships with Wingspan, National Dance Institute, and New York Philharmonic. For the past three 
years PS 199 has been working on implementing the Ruler program. The RULER program is a social-emotional 
curriculum created by the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and focuses on the following: (Recognizing emotions 
in self and others, Understanding the cause and consequences of emotions; Labeling emotions accurately, Expressing 
emotions appropriately, Regulating emotions effectively). This past year we also provided a series of parent 
workshops on our social emotional curriculum--RULER. Although we have implemented this program only 82% of 
teachers that completed the 2018 school survey felt that our community recognized disruptive behavior as a social-
emotional learning opportunity. In addition, only 83% of teachers felt that discipline is applied to students fairly in our 
community. As such it is important that we continue to ensure that the program is implemented with fidelity by all 
community members.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, students and staff will adhere to all RULER protocols and utilize anchor tools effectively (Recognizing 
emotions in self and others, Understanding the cause and consequences of emotions; Labeling emotions accurately, 
Expressing emotions appropriately, Regulating emotions effectively) resulting in a 5% increase in response to the 
questions: 1)Disruptive behavior is seen as a social emotional learning opportunity for students. 2) Discipline is 
applied fairly to students in the area of supportive environment on the NYC School Survey.

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

We utilize several structures to allow teachers the opportunity to collaborate. Class assignments are made to 
maximize opportunities for in-class student support using year-end reports from teachers. Schedules are created to 
promote collaboration, experienced teachers use their professional periods to support new teachers, and teachers 
are included in school and grade-wide decisions. Our teachers engage in calculated conversations around curricula. 
Teaching practices are consistent across grade levels.Observations are scheduled by grade level and subject to assess 
coherence of curriculum . New teachers are paired with teachers to support their practice. The administration attends 
grade level meeting and grade professional development. 

Tailored professional learning teams are arranged based on observational anecdotes and directly from teachers 
indicating an interest or need for further development. Teachers are assigned to "speciality groups" to allow for inter-
grade collaboration and to share practices. 199 has only recently incorporated ICT classes and we are in year four of 
this model. This school year will be the first year whereby each grade will have an ICT classroom. ICT teams benefit 
from professional development to support working as a cohesive team. ICT teachers have expressed the interest to 
further hone their skills in the approaches of co-teaching. As such we will continue to partner with G & R Inclusive 
group to support our ICT classes . In order to further support this goal ICT teams will schedule monthly meetings to 
discuss interventions for targeted students. Another key component of our professional learning plan this year entails 
grade level teams scheduling inter-visitations based upon a need on the grade level.  

 

At present, 153 students or nearly 18% of students receive some form of special educational services. June 2018 
MOSL data indicated that 69% of students with IEPs are meeting or exceeding reading benchmarks. We will continue 
to align resources to support students in a strategic manner by implementing target curricula to address learning 
needs.

The 2015-2016 Quality Review indicated a rating of Well-Developed in "engagement of structured professional 
collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared leadership and focuses on improved student 
learning." In addition, qualitative feedback has indicated teacher satisfaction in working with their colleagues during 
their designated professional learning periods. However, 2018 survey results indicate only 70% of teachers are 
satisfied with the quality of professional development. As we have grown as a school, grade level teams and teacher 
teams are instrumental in implementation of initiatives and/or curriculum development. Grade level meetings occur 
on a weekly basis to afford teachers the opportunity to discuss the current curriculum and plan accordingly. In June of 
2018, a professional survey was administered to staff to obtain information on desired professional development. Our 
professional development team will meet on a monthly basis to improve the quality of professional development for 
staff. The PD team will serve as liaisons to the general teaching community in gathering feedback on professional 
development sessions.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the

and Time-bound. 
 

By June 2019, all teachers will engage in professional development cycles strategically created based upon area of 
interest and on need resulting in a 10% increase in teachers' satisfaction in the area of professional development as 
indicated by the 2018-2019 School Quality Guide Survey .

PS 199 has several family committees that support various initiatives of our community. At present, there is a 
Community Cares Committee, Diversity Committee, and Stem Committee. One common goal has been to increase 
student participation within these committees' efforts. This past year our fifth grade students partnered with a 
neighboring school to provide sandwiches to the organization One Sandwich at a Time. Our Diversity Committee has 
hosted several events in our community that celebrate diversity. We have strong family participation for classroom 
and school wide events that celebrate students' accomplishments. However, attendance at PTA meetings have 
fluctuated in numbers and is not representative of the attendance at other class and school wide events. It is a goal to 
increase participation at PTA meetings by strategically planning topics that are relevant to particular grade levels 
(examples test prep, digital media awareness, social emotional strategies, learning strategies). The 2016 Quality 
Review also indicated that parents were aware of numerous resources and events in the school community but had 
difficulty articulating ways that they could work with our school community to ensure student progress towards 
academic expectations. The 2018-2019 School Quality Guide indicated a 4.22 rating in the area of Strong Family 
Community Ties.  

A Parent Engagement Survey was undertaken by the SLT and PTA in January 2017. Results indicated that over 90% of 
parents regularly attend classroom curriculum nights, class visits and performances. Around half of respondents also 
attend PTA meetings at least occasionally and the annual SLT Parents as Partners curriculum event. Comments 
indicated that, if available, parents would attend more presentations on grade specific curriculum. The most popular 
topics for PTA meetings include curriculum, school safety and Q&A with the Principal. The Parent Engagement Survey 
confirmed that PS199 has an active parent body. Over 80% or respondents help in the classroom throughout the year 
and about 60% of respondents help with school wide events. 
 
We will also be increasing school wide events associated to our curriculum. The Garden Committee for instance will 
hold two garden events in the Fall. Our Diversity Committee will continue to have at least two school wide events for 
families and we are looking on ways to expand their mission into other events such as our Thanksgiving Potluck and 
our Holiday Celebration Event.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 199 Jessie Isador Straus, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part 
A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy 
to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 199 will support parents and families of Title I students by:  

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology;  

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children;  

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress;  

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand;  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community;  

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:  

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;  

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.;  

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;  

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;  

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions;  

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;  

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:  

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;  

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;  

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  

● supporting or hosting Family Day events;  

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress;  

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress;  

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.  

 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

P.S. 199 Jessie Isador Straus, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act 
(ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by 
Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 
For all grades, our school uses Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Project Running Records to assess reading, including 
comprehension, miscues, and fluency, also concepts of print, letter/sound identification and high frequency word 
recognition.  We have introduced Fundations in Kindergarten and First Grade, a program that starts by teaching letter sound 
recognition, cvc words, blends, long vowels, diagraphs, etc and continues developing up the grades.  We will be phrasing this 
program in across the grades year by year. Teacher assessments from Fundations inform instruction and groupings in the 
classroom and for intervention. 
To assess development of writing skills, we use a narrative writing continuum. 
Some teachers also use Words Their Way spelling inventory.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

Data is reviewed and shared at weekly grade team meetings, with administration and input into DOE Assessment PRO.  For 
example, we use TCRWP in the classroom to assess independent and instructional reading levels and groups, guide instruction, 
and to periodically assess if students are meeting benchmarks. 
Based on the results of our assessments, we plan and implement targeted interventions for individual students in their areas 
of need to support classroom progress and prepare state exams.  Various supports are possible for students who demonstrate 
that they are behind and not making AYP.  These supports include small group tutoring, 1:1 support with a student teacher or 
with an America Reads tutor, and CSE evaluation. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of our ESL program by monitoring the progress of ELLs throughout the year.  The ESL teacher uses 
regular progress notes and language structures checklist by level for each student, and rubrics for scoring and measure 
progress in oral language development, writing and reading comprehension.  We look at data from the NYC performance tasks 
and school performance tasks.  We also evaluate the ESL program through analysis of data from the ELA, Math, Science and 
NYSESLAT state assessments. We use this data as the basis of making decisions and modifications about programming, 
instruction and professional development.  Progress in literacy is measured by improvement in reading levels, comprehension 
and writing.  
 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Based on the results of our assessments, we plan and implement targeted interventions for individual students in their areas 
of need to support classroom progress and prepare state exams.  Various supports are possible for students who demonstrate 
that they are behind and not making AYP.  These supports include small group tutoring, Guided Reading, 1:1 support with a 
student teacher or with an America Reads tutor, and CSE evaluation.  Students are assessed weekly to see if they continue to 
need the intense supports.  Monthly assessments are cumulative.  We may change and modify programs quarterly, as students 
may need different programs. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
  
We provide rigorous instruction that includes English language development for our ELLs.Teachers use knowledge about the 
ELLs’ linguistic and educational backgrounds to inform instructional planning.Language development is integrated into content 
instruction, embedded in meaningful, authentic activities, and relevant to students’ background knowledge.Assessment is 
included on a regular basis.Various supports are possible for students who demonstrate that they are behind and not making 
AYP.These supports include small group tutoring, 1:1 support with a student teacher or with an America Reads tutor, and CSE 
evaluation. Intensive phonics instruction using Wilson Reading Program and modified math programs are used to meet 
student needs.Math intervention is provided 2-4 times a week for each participating child in groups of 1-6 students. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 Data patterns on the NYSITELL demonstrate that most of the children in our school enter ESL at lower proficiency levels.  Most 
of these students are new arrivals to the U.S.  Some of these students demonstrate some proficiency in listening and in basic 
letter sounds.  Other of the new ELLs entered at upper proficiency levels, often new arrivals with some formal English studies 
in their home country.  Often most of these ELLs demonstrate a need for development of speaking skills, even with some 
previous school experience with reading or writing.  NYSESLAT data patterns show that our students very often reach 
proficiency within 2-3 years.  Also NYSESLAT data patterns show that for Entering newcomer ELLs, reading and writing are the 
areas that are developed after speaking and listening and can benefit from additional emphasis. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Findings are shared with administration, with classroom teachers at weekly grade level meetings, and with intervention 
specialists.  Also the findings are shared with the School Psychologist regarding ELLs who may need a CSE evaluation. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

   Students are in mainstream heterogeneously grouped classes on the grade and some special education students in 
self contained or ICT classes.  ESL instruction is delivered through an integrated and standalone model.  Freestanding 
ENL groups are organized by grade and proficiency level, based on the guidelines outlined in the NYSED CR Part 154.2 
chart for ENL units of study and staffing requirements. Ms. Bindman services the standalone ENL groups for entering 
and emerging students.  Groups are organized in groups by contiguous grades, K-1, 2-3 and 4-5.  There are between 3 
to 6 students in each group.  Standalone and integrated support are scheduled with reference to the state mandated 
number of minutes for each proficiency level 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not applicable   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Not applicable    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

         PS199 refers to the CR Part 154 requirements for mandated ENL minutes, for standalone ENL and integrated ENL 
depending upon the students’ proficiency levels.  Beginner and entering students receive 360 ENL minutes, 180 standalone 
and 180 integrated; Intermediate/emerging receive 360 minutes, 90 standalone, 180 integrated plus flexible 90 minutes either 
standalone or integrated; intermediate/transitioning receives 180 minutes, 90 minutes integrated and another 90 minutes 
either standalone or integrated; advanced/expanding receives 180 minutes integrated.  Proficient/commanding students 
receive 90 minutes integrated ENL.  Integrated ENL is in ELA or another content area, support during writing workshop, 
reading workshop, science, math, or social studies.  For standalone, the ESL teacher coordinates with the mainstream 
classroom and specialty subject area teachers to ensure content alignment. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 The ESL certified teachers collaborate with the classroom and content area teachers on curriculum and student progress. The 
ESL certified teachers provide support for the academic vocabulary and language structures specific to the content area, and 
strategies for the proficiency level/language acquisition stage of the students.  For beginner and newcomers, for example, we 
use extensive visuals, gestures, carefully structured questions, TPR, charts, graphs, chants and songs.  All students participate 
in hands-on experiences and projects, where oral and written language is used in small group and partner activities and 
discussions.  Methods are drawn from approaches such as QTEL, SIOPP, Pauline Gibbons, etc incorporating visuals, graphic 
organizers and technology.  These approaches emphasize language development across content areas and support the 
Common Core emphasis on reading and writing for information and standards for oral language. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Students are given the Spanish LAB if they have a Spanish HLIS and are eligible for ENL services.  The Spanish LAB helps 
determine language dominance and inform instruction.  Students are asked to provide writing samples or write in journals in 
their native language that can be evaluated by instructional staff fluent in that language. For example, in recent years we have 
had pedagogical staff fluent in Japanese, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, French and Hebrew to support students with those 
language backgrounds.  Translated math and science exams are provided for ELLs for the state math and science exams as 
needed, or a translator is provided for lower incidence languages where indicated.  In the classroom, or standalone ENL, we 
may have more than one student with the same first language where we can create partners or subgroups of children with the 
same language.  Then there are opportunities for these children to have academic discussion in their first language, followed 
by a share out in English.  Or, a commanding student may lead a subgroup of children.     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a.    
Our SIFE plan highlights additional instructional time, offering students opportunities to participate in small group instruction 
during the school day as well as in extended day,and/or summer programs.The plan combines literacy development in the 
students’ native language where possible, English language development, and content instruction.Personalized Learning Plans 
for students would include English and native language diagnostic tests, academic data analysis, social-emotional learning, 
short and long term goals, research based instructional strategies and supports, and school-family connection. 
 When we have a SIFE student, we provide a variety of supports.  For example, SIFE students may receive explicit math 
instruction to fill in the gaps of what they have not learned, then assessed monthly for skill growth. Also we often assess the 
students more frequently –once a month—to measure their growth.  Spelling curriculum and weekly spelling quizzes are 
adapted.  SIFE students are provided with an IPad where they can access various choices of books at their independent level 
through Raz Kids, and follow the text as it is read aloud, both fiction and non-fiction.  Nonfiction sources have helped fill in 
gaps in their knowledge in social studies, science and American history.  Students also have access to Brainpop and other 
content related videos, which they view with closed captioning 
b. 
PS 199 has newcomer students in all grades.Many of our newcomers are new or recent arrivals to the U.S. starting at entering 
or emerging levels.For standalone ENL, newcomer students are in groups of no more than 2 contiguous grades, based on level, 
with differentiated instruction supporting differences in grade level curriculum and specifics of proficiency.Newcomer students 
are supported in their classroom through collaboration between an ESL certified teacher and the classroom teacher, focused 
around support for ELA or content area instruction in science, math or social studies.The ESL certified teachers articulate with 
the classroom teachers and content area teachers of the newcomer students on a regular basis.Instructional materials are 
selected that provide extensive use of visuals and graphic support for text, and with a focus on language 
development.Instructional strategies for lower level newcomers include instruction based on authentic hands on activities, the 
use of maps, visual on content area word walls, TPR, modeling, gestures, frequent checks for listening comprehension through 
careful questioning allowing students to respond through pointing, a few words, response to either/or questions, sentence 
frames, and connections to the students’ background knowledge.Computer programs allow students to interact with stories 
read aloud on the internet with visual text, such as Tumblebooks, Raz Kids.Other computer programs effective for newcomer 
ELLs that we use include Brainpop, with closed caption, Raz Kids, abcya.com and Starfall, along with selective use of google 
translate. 
c.   
For developing ELLs, we generally use running records more frequently to assess their reading growth, approximately once a 
month.Especially for developing ELLs with reading levels below grade, they may have access to an IPad where they can access 
Raz Kids for a wider range of non-fiction and fiction books at their level.It is also helpful for them to read the text while

content related videos, used with closed captioning so they can read the words as they are read aloud.The ELL students have 
repeated opportunities to view the videos. Developing ELL students are strategically partnered to provide another level of 
support. 
d.   Not applicable.  
e.   
Former ELLs are entitled to 90 minutes integrated ENL per week and also testing accommodations for two years following 
scoring proficiency on the NYSESLAT.These accommodations include extended time and separate location.In addition, former 
ELLs may participate in extended day programs to help continued development of reading and math skills.Former ELLs are 
closely monitored by their classroom teachers.The ESL certified teachers provide additional strategies to classroom teachers to 
support these students in the areas which have been identified as needing additional language development. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELLs with IEPs are in mainstream inclusion classes, ICT classes, or self-contained special education classes.  We currently have 
ICT classes in K, 1 and 5, and are adding grades starting with grade 2 in 2017-18.  In the special education self-contained classes 
there are bilingual teacher assistants who provide a small teacher: student ratio.  Instructional materials and strategies include 
just right books, fiction and non-fiction content area books, materials involving graphs, charts, visuals, captions and diagrams; 
TPR, read alouds and involving students in authentic activities for purposeful use of language in all four modalities and for 
integration of language into content curriculum. In addition, in the ICT classes 2 teachers provide a smaller teacher: student 
ratio.  In our 5th grade ICT class, ELLs are assessed in reading more frequently, once a month, and spelling curriculum for 
weekly spelling quizzes is adapted.  As noted previously, IPads for students allow them access to Raz Kids reading at their level, 
BrainPop and other content videos with closed captioning, in addition to visual vocabulary lists with pictures for social studies. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 The ESL schedule is carefully designed and coordinated in collaboration with the principal, classroom teachers, ESL certified 
teachers, IEP teacher and other service providers.  The students are serviced through integrated classroom work and small 
group standalone support, as well as individual support for certain services. Students are fully integrated into the classrooms 
and the school.  Collaboration takes place between the teachers and the service providers who work with individual children.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 All intervention services are provided in English.  Intervention services include Wilson for reading, and small group pull out and 
push-in for math.  Supports for students include extended day, small group tutoring, 1:1 support with a student teacher or 
with an America Reads tutor, and CSE evaluation 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We will have additional ESL certified pedagogical staff to help provide ELL services.  We are trying to concentrate ELLs into one 
or two classes on the grade to help facilitate additional integrated services. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Not applicable. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 Groupings are heterogeneous.  ELLs participate in extended day, chess club, and fully participate in all school activities 
including arts residency programs such as NY Philharmonic in the schools, National Dance Institute, Vital Theater, Lincoln 
Center Education, Wingspan arts, and others.  Scheduling is designed and flexible to support ELLs’ participation in all school 
activities.  We have before school and after school Title III programs for ELLs in small groups that meet weekly, as well as 
periodic family weekend activities. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
For reading, we use selected titles from Benchmark Education materials specifically designed for ELLs, also Scholastic non-
fiction vocabulary readers, National Geographic Kids, and other titles selected for their vocabulary and text format and 
support.   Also we use Best Practices for Reading series at different levels.  As noted above, students use Raz Kids at their level 
to follow as the text is read aloud, as well as Starfall and other online programs.   We also use BrainPop and other content 
related videos, with closed captioning so students can listen and read along as the words are read aloud.  Also for science and 
social studies, we use vocabulary charts with visuals, graphic organizers, concept maps, content picture dictionaries and 
content books and charts designed specifically for ELLs.   We routinely use google images for text support.  Recently we have 
augmented the ESL room with a new smartboard, IPads for students as well as access to chromebooks. Next year we will also 
use certain voice record technologies with students..  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

ESL and bilingual certified teachers use cognates in Spanish or French as appropriate with students.  Students especially in 
upper grades have oral translating dictionaries in their home language.  Wherever possible, students new to English have a 
language buddy in the same class or on the same grade who speaks the same home language as well as English.  For students 
newly acquiring English, they may initially write in their home language in the classroom to keep up with new concepts, 
transitioning into English as soon as appropriate for each student. In ESL and classroom instruction, student partners or 
subgroups of the same language are provided some opportunities for academic discussion in their home language, and then 
share out in English.  When possible, partners or subgroups will be led by a student at Expanding or Commanding level. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

  ESL students are grouped by grade and proficiency level.  The ESL certified teachers maintain regular contact with classroom 
teachers to ensure maximum integration of language development within content area curriculum on the grade.  Content 
material, including fiction and non-fiction content, is available in a range of levels.  Supplemental materials such as picture 
dictionaries are available for a range of ages, including language for daily use, and content picture dictionaries for upper grade 
students. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 Not applicable 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
New families are welcomed to the school community by the PTA. A buddy system is established to support new members of 
the PS 199 community.  Families are given contact information to arrange after school play dates.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

There are no language electives currently offered at PS 199.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Not Applicable

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
  The ELL teachers will attend at least 3-5 workshops during the year, focused on Common Core, vocabulary development, 
academic discourse, using technology, and reading with ELLs.  The ELL teachers will participate in professional development 
district meetings.    The office of ELLs offers professional development on development academic and social language relating 
to the CCLS. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
ESL is specifically addressed in our Teacher’s College PD.  ESL PD takes place during grade level meetings each month, and 
during Monday extended day PD time.  Topics will include:  language acquisition, integrating language objectives and language 
acquisition in core content instruction, vocabulary development, understanding ELLs at different proficiency levels and stages 
of language acquisition, differentiation, and information about ESL compliance and testing. We will keep attendance on sign in 
sheets, and agendas. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In addition to parent teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, or any other meetings, we also meet with parents of our 
ELLs individually at least once a year to discuss program goals, their child's language development progress, ESL assessment 
results, or language development needs.  We generally have very high parent involvement and participation.  We have 
Tuesday extended day set aside for parent meetings.  If parents are unable to come at that time, we coordinate a time before 
or after school, or an appropriate time during the school day to accommodate parent availability and school schedules. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
We have families from many different countries at PS 199,  usually with approximately 24 languages represented.  We have a 
very active PTA, many committees and a very high level of parent involvement.  We have a diversity committee who plans 
multi-cultural events throughout the year, usually once a month.  For example, that might be Indian dance, Lights Festival, 
fashion shows, and a luau.  Classrooms celebrate specific cultures and may be amplified by an outside cultural 
group.  Publishing parties are extremely well attended in general by parents.  There are many class trips in which parents are 
actively involved, with many trips based on a specific culture.  Parents are also very involved as parent volunteers for special 
projects, such as classroom cooking, some of which may be focused around a specific culture, for example, making won 
tons.  For next year we are planning to have a buddy system to pair a new family with a current family with the same language.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Louise Xerri, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At registration, parents indicate their preferred language of communication on the Parents Preferred Language 
form in the packet. This informs the school which households required translated materials and information. 
Classroom teachers meet parents in September and advise the administration of any parents who are in need of 
translation. The HLIS form part III also asks parents to indicate their preferred language of communication with 
the school. Posters from the DOE Office of English Language Learners are posted at the entrance of the building to 
advise families to ask for assistance in obtaining translation and interpretation services .  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Teachers of the students of the families receive a copy of the parent preference information and are advised of the 
resources available for communicating in English 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The language of preference is recorded on Emergency Contact cards and in ATS. Appropriate posters are hung at the 
beginning of the school year and refreshed during Parent Teacher Conferences. Availability of translations and 
interpretation services is advertised using multilingual fliers. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services
