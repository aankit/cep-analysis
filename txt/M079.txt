Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The Framework for Great Schools calls for school communities to develop a shared understanding of the essential 
elements to support school improvement efforts, assess needs, establish goals, and engage in cycles of continuous 
learning with a clearly articulated instructional focus. This common goal is embedded in the school’s mission 
statement and inspires collaboration, creates a shared language, promotes consistency and coherence in practice, 
and directly impacts on teacher performance and student outcomes. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Our instructional vision at P79M- Horan School is to empower all stakeholders by cultivating and refining a culture of 
equity, diversity, and excellence. This vision is complemented by our school mission statement, to strive to create 
equitable opportunities for all students and stakeholders in a safe and supportive environment through a 
commitment to high expectations, a respect for individuality and diversity, and a dedication to collaboration and 
community building. With a school-wide commitment to a growth mindset, we seek to improve student outcomes by 
continuously reflecting on and refining our work. We endeavor to support the growth of all community stakeholders 
on their journey as learners as they strive to reach their highest potential. To address these priorities, our school 
community has articulated an instructional focus which embeds tiered questioning and discussion techniques in our 
design of coherent instruction, supported by the analysis of qualitative and quantitative data, using multiple points of 
access and literacy based cross curricula planning to foster greater student engagement. To accomplish these goals, 
we have crafted and articulated a course for improvement, a theory of action, which explains the specific changes we 
intend to make as a community in order to improve teaching and learning – “If we embed tiered questioning and 
discussion techniques in our design of coherent instruction, supported by the analysis of qualitative and quantitative 
data then we would have laid the foundation to foster greater student engagement”. To ensure compliance and 
adherence to high expectations we have established a set of “best practices”: 1-Students' celebration boards must be 
updated twice a month with authentic student work, rubrics, and next steps, 2-Homework must be given to students 
every day and must be referenced in lesson plans, 3-Class schedules must be posted in front of the classroom using 
students’ preferred mode of communication with their picture, 4-Vocabulary must be relevant to instruction and 
related to the content of the lesson, 5-Classroom rules and charters, Mood meter, and TEAM matrix, must be posted 
in the classroom and referenced throughout the instructional day to cultivate a culture of respect and collaboration, 
6-Instructional planning must be standards based, reference skills students need to learn in order to achieve their IEP 
gaols, clearly delineated teaching points and objectives, opportunities for data collection, include how PBIS (Positive 
Behavior Intervention Supports ) will be utilized and instructional resources such as curriculum maps, Mathletics, 
Flocabulary, Rethink curricular framework and Attainment, and 7-Assessment Policy that includes ongoing assessment 
throughout instructional activities, participation in self-reflective assessments at the end of all lesson, and feedback 
for next steps pertaining to student work.  

During the 2018-19 school year, our school instructional focus will continue to strengthen student achievement in a 
departmentalized setting, where students have the opportunity to participate in standard-based instruction aligned to 
the Dynamic Learning Maps Blueprints for ELA, Math, and Science, the NYS Learning Standards for Social Studies, the 
NYS Career Development and Occupational Studies Standards (CDOS), the New and Home Language Arts Progressions 
(Bilingual Common Core Initiative from Engage NY), the SANDI/FAST skills inventories, and the PBIS program. In 
addition, the revised P79M Curriculum Maps for ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies will continue to serve as 
planning tools for examining, organizing, and implementing standard based instruction. These maps are an in-depth 
view of concepts and related skills students should know and be able to do in ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies 
over the course of a school year. These maps also serve as tools for gathering data related to strategies employed and 
assessments used in each content area . Included in the maps is a scope and sequence to guide teachers about the 
depth, breadth, and order content should be taught for optimal learning. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P79M-Dr. Edmund Horan School is a District 75 high school located in the community of Harlem serving students with 
most significant disabilities who are alternately assessed. Our school is currently serving 247 students in 12:1:4, 6:1:1, 
8:1:1, and 12:1:1 cohorts, from grades 6 through 12. Our school population comprises 70.85% males, 29.15% females, 
27.13% Black, 64.78% Hispanic, 5.26% White, 1.62% Asian, and 0.81% American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 0.4% 
Multi-racial. The student body includes 40.89 % English language learners and 100% students with IEPs. 96.76% of 
students enrolled received Self-Contained services more than 60% of the week. The Attendance Rate Year to Date 
indicator for the 2017-18 school year is 79.3% (June 2018) 

As a school community, we continue to revise structures for impacting student achievement through a cycle of 
continuous learning and collaboration. Our instructional focus for the 2018-19 school year addresses the need for 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

strengthening designing coherent instruction, refining the use of data to inform instruction, engaging students in 
learning, and using questioning and discussion techniques. The refinement of this focus has been guided by a set of 
transformative elements and quality assessments of school communities taken from the Framework for Great 
Schools, the Quality Review Rubric, School Survey, and the Danielson Framework for Teaching. Our aim is to continues 
to increase the learning opportunities for all learners, increase consistency and coherence in instructional practice, 
enhance peer collaboration, and inform professional development plans.  

For the past four years, our instructional program has followed a cohort, self-contained delivery model (12:1:1 
Alternate, 8:1:1, 6:1:1, and 12:1:4 service categories) to address IEP mandates and meet State and District 
expectations. In 2017-18, our school community transitioned to a departmentalized delivery model for addressing 
core content areas (ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies) and electives (English Literature, Bilingual Literature, 
Multicultural Cuisines thru Social Studies, Music, Art thru Social Studies, Music and Theater, SMiLE, Vocational, etc.). 
In 2018-19, this departmentalized organizational structure aims at (1) Refining our culture of high expectations 
informed by Webb’s Depth of Knowledge), (2) designing coherent instruction that is differentiated (Universal Design 
for Learning), (3) creating a school environment that supports independence, self-regulation, diversity, and social-
emotional learning (PBIS, TCIS, Getting Ready to Learn), (4) promoting peer collaboration and Inquiry, (5) deepening 
our successes with our Parent and Community Engagement team and our Bilingual Parent Group to foster greater 
parental involvement in the instructional process, and (6) promoting safety, trust, and respect for all (General 
Response Protocol). Some of the projected benefits of this departmentalized delivery model include opportunities for 
(1) teachers to become specialists in the subject matter they teach (Danielson’s component 1A-Knowledge of Content 
and Pedagogy), (2) targeted professional development based on student needs (Danielson’s component 3D-Using 
Assessment in Instruction), (3) team collaboration within and across disciplines (Departmental Team Meetings), and 
(4) exposure to a variety of instructional environments during the flow of the day. For students, the benefits include: 
(1) exposure to specialized content through multiple teaching styles, rigorous habits, and differentiation (Danielson’s 
component 1E-Designing Coherent Instruction), (2) ability to make relevant connections within and across disciplines 
for transition readiness, and (3) have opportunities for high levels of engagement and collaboration (Danielson’s 
component 3C-Engaging Students in Learning). In the area of Effective Leadership, the school leadership will continue 
to provide meaningful and actionable feedback to teachers, through the ADVANCE cycle of classroom observations, to 
strengthen the impact of measures of teacher practice (MOTP) on the measures of student learning (MOSL). 

Through strategic programming, in alignment with the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, school leadership will 
continue to leverage resources to support teacher practice and collaboration by scheduling weekly departmental 
meetings, Literacy Design Collaborative (LDC) meetings, new teacher meetings, monthly staff meetings, and district 
and school based coaching and mentoring. The following professional development topics will continue to be 
addressed during the 2018-19 school year: IEP Educational Benefit and Transition (NYS PP#13), writing quality IEPs, 
standard based instruction (P79M Curriculum Maps, Common Core Instructional Shifts), and curricula (Attainment, 
Mathletics, Flocabulary, Rethink curricular framework, AbleNet’s Equals), rigor (Webb’s Depth Of Knowledge), access 
(Universal Design for Learning), assessment (SANDI-FAST, NYSAA, NYSESLAT), strategies (TEACCH/Structured 
Teaching, Literacy Design Collaborative, Rethink, Structured Methods in Language Education), information 
technology, social emotional learning and safety (PBIS/TCI, General Response Protocol, Getting Ready to Learn), 
English Language Learners (NYS CR Part 154, Home and New Language Arts Progressions), community based 
instruction and work-study programs, and related services (physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech, 
counseling), and performance and accountability tools (Quality Review rubric, Danielson Framework for Teaching, 
School Survey).As we continue to build a culture of high expectations, it is important that as a community, we support 
the development of strong teacher teams, promote leadership capacity among stakeholders, and share 
responsibilities appropriately. 

In addressing the capacity element of Strong Family and Community Partnerships, our school will continue to leverage 
resources to (1) promote an active parent association membership and (2) expand the vocational training program 
through worksites supported by the job developer, transition coordinator, and parent coordinator on site. The goal is 
to provide opportunities for family involvement in the educational process, create outlets to communicate needs and 
access resources, allow families to participate in professional development and other school events geared at 
strengthening the partnership between the home, school, and the immediate community. During the 2018-19 school

year our school community will look at strengthening the partnership with business organizations and agencies to 
support our transition planning efforts: Metropolitan Hospital, Modell’s Sporting Goods, Salvation Army, Burlington 
Coat Factory, Goodwill Industries @ 88th Street, Association to Benefit Children (ABC Daycare), Pelham Fritz 
Recreation Center, and Project Search Program for Manhattan at RXR. Project Search is a none-year, school-to-work 
high school transition program that takes place entirely in the workplace. Total workplace immersion at a host 
employer settings facilitates classroom instruction, career exploration, and relevant job skills training through 
internships. In-house work study options include: Mouse Squad, Building Maintenance, and Clerical. Students 
attending these work-site programs will have an opportunity to develop transition readiness in a variety of job-
related, vocational experiences, and work settings. 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Following the guidance provided by the Framework for Great Schools, calling on schools to reflect upon and refine 
practices for addressing instructional priorities, our school community reviewed the most recent available school data 
and the feedback and recommendations provided during the 2017- 2018 Quality Review and Principal Performance 
Observations (PPOs) to inform our action plan for reaching benchmarks of quality for the 2018-19 school year. In 
order to identify specific needs of students, our school community used a variety of data sources: SESIS records 
including IEPs, functional behavior plans and assessments (BIP, FBAs), formative (SANDI-FAST) and summative 
(NYSAA, NYSESLAT) assessment results, student work samples, rubrics, report cards, ATS reports, OORS and SWIS 
reports, Level One Interest and Preference Inventory, and the NYC School Survey results. The data gathered from 
these sources was analyzed using the “Turning Data into Actionable Information” steps (collect from sources, review 
for relevance, analyze for trends, formulate for possible root causes and barriers, and target action steps) to 
determine students’ academic, behavioral, and social emotional learning needs, establish a plan for rigorous and 
differentiated instruction, ensure appropriate placement of students in a least restrictive environment, leverage 
resources for instructional resources and professional development, monitor IEP compliance to related services 
mandates, and establish instructional next steps for students. The following needs were identified during this data 
analysis process: (1) the need for standard based instruction aligned to the DLM Essential Elements for ELA, math, 
science, the State learning standards for social studies, and the NYS Career Development and Occupational Studies 
standards (NYSCDOS), (2) the need for students to engage in problem solving, Inquiry, and peer collaboration, and (3) 
the need for students to use self-assessment tools to monitor their own progress. In order to address these needs, 
our school community refined the P79M curriculum maps to strengthen the alignment to the Target level nodes, the 
SANDI-FAST skill sets, the NYS CDOS skills, and the NYS Home and New Language Arts progressions. The P79M 
Curriculum Maps continue to provide opportunities for designing coherent instruction that is (1) centered on the 
needs and interest of students, and (2) follows the feedback received from ADVANCE for the purpose of making 
content more relevant and accessible, to maximize the transfer of skills and promote generalization. The curriculum 
maps support the development of standard based learning experiences that are (1) coherent across cohorts, (2) 
varied in levels of complexity (rigor), (3) differentiated to provide multiple access points, and (4) supported by a 
variety of instructional strategies and age-respectful, multisensory materials, i.e. structured teaching, Home and New 
Language Arts Progressions, Webb’s Depth of Knowledge (DOK), Universal Design for Learning (UDL), Getting Ready to 
Learn (GRTL), Structured Methods in Language Education (SMiLE), Literacy Design Collaborative (LCD), Rethink 
Instructional Shifts, and PBIS-The Ruler Approach/Emotional Literacy. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

By bringing into focus the Framework for Great Schools, our school community is able to reflect upon and refine the 
structures supporting the development of transition readiness and the acquisition of 21st century skills. This process 
involves calibrating the impact of teacher practice (MOTP) on student achievement (MOSL) and engaging the school 
community in team reflection and goal-setting to inform the organizational decision-making process promote greater 
instructional consistency and coherence while fostering a culture of high expectations, diversity, and respect for all.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

ELL Proficiency Levels (K-12) (2016-17) 

  Total Enrollment: 240  

  ELL – # Enrolled: 102 
  ELL - % of Total Enrollment: 39 
  Emerging (EM) Level - % of Total Enrollment: 11 
  Transitioning (TR) - % of Total Enrollment: 4 

Based on a review of the data related to Rigorous Instruction, an identified strength related to this Framework 
element is the strength of our Common Core Shifts for Mathematics, to which 74% of those surveyed responded 
positively. An identified need related to this Framework element is our Common Core Shifts for Literacy, to which 68% 
responded positively, indicating an increased need for more rigorous writing opportunities for our students. An 
additional need is that of Quality of Student Discussion, on which 36% responded positively.  

The school’s curricular decisions build coherence and promote critical thinking and transition readiness across grades 
and content areas. The P79M Curriculum Maps were developed to address the expectations of the DLM Essential 
Elements and NYS Career Development and Occupational Standards (NYS CDOS). The screens in each map have been 
designed to support IEP-driven learning experiences and address the academic, linguistic, behavioral, and social-
emotional needs of students with significant disabilities. The information presented in these screens supports the 
planning for rigor (Depth of Knowledge) and differentiation of instruction (Universal Design for Learning). These 
curriculum maps have been revised for the 2018-19 school year to offer a more in-depth look at the NYS CDOS 
standards for the purpose of helping students earn a commencement credential upon graduation and facilitate 
employment outcomes for successful candidates through the Project Search program. The Skills and Achievement 
Credential is the sole exiting credential available to students with an IEP who participate in the New York State 
Alternate Assessment (NYSAA) in place of standardized assessments (NYS High School Academic Policy Guide).  

To support our teachers as they leverage best practices in planning, instruction, and assessments across grades, 
content areas, and cohorts, our school community decided to continue working on units of studies in ELA, Math, 
Science, and Social Studies for the 2018-19 school year to elevate the quality of teaching and learning, build 
instructional coherence, and improve student outcomes. A part of this work will include time dedicated to improving 
quality of student discussion, by spending one week of each team meeting cycle planning for questioning and 
discussion techniques for each unit. Additionally, a week will be spent addressing the need to provide additional 
writing opportunities for our students by planning rigorous writing activities aligned to each unit.

3. A review of the 2017-2018 OORS Snapshot, Incident Location Summary, and Hourly Analysis reports for Levels 1 – 5 
reveal the need for a web based protocol for transitioning in the community that will ensure the safety of students at 
all times and reduce the time allocations currently reserved for the morning/afternoon transition and busing. This 
web based program will reduce the number of incidents, support a safe and orderly transition from home-to-school, 
during school, and school-to-home, allow to monitor and troubleshoot the arrival/dismissal process using real time 
data, and keep records for further analysis and next steps, which will support the whole child.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the school will implement a web-based protocol to ensure safe and effective transitioning practices

School leaders will leverage resources to support a school wide 
implementation of the revised 2018-19 P79M Curriculum Map 
for Emotional Literacy to promote a culture of social emotional 
learning, high expectations for behavior, positive decision 
making, self-regulation and advocacy, socialization, and peer 
collaboration during the instructional day. [Ongoing]. 

The school community will foster a supportive learning 
environment during the flow of the instructional day grounded 
on the principles of the PBIS/TCI and GRP programs to support a 
positive school culture that focuses on safety and high 
expectations. [Ongoing]. 

Teachers will implement the Getting Ready to Learn (GRTL) 
program in their homeroom classes to foster a learning 
environment that is calm, safe, comfortable, and prepares 
students to be in optimal physical, emotional, and cognitive 
states for learning and decision making. [Ongoing] 

Teachers will include a “Transitioning Safely throughout the

Based on the data outlined above, two identified strengths for our community are Peer Collaboration and Cultural 
Awareness and Inclusive Classroom Instruction. An identified need for our community is Innovation and Collective 
Responsibility. In an effort to build upon our strengths and address our need, we have put together a STEM inquiry 
team to examine Project Based Learning as a way to build on our existing strength of peer collaboration and address 
the need of innovation and collective responsibility.  

Our examination of Project Base Learning as a vehicle to engage students with significant disabilities prompted a shift 
in practice to a dynamic classroom approach where students acquire content knowledge through active exploration of 
real-world problems. Project Based Learning offers an approach that leads students toward a post-secondary life 
where content knowledge is coupled with critical thinking, collaboration and communication, real-world problem 
solving, self-regulation and the use of technology for learning and self-management. Project-based learning is also the 
means in which STEAM education provides students with IEP driven learning experiences, rigorous and differentiated

instruction, interdisciplinary content, and opportunities for collaboration and self-determination, with the appropriate 
assessments, technology support and accommodations. Project Based Learning as a pedagogy is a great vehicle for 
facilitating meaningful transition because each of its project design elements and teaching practices are geared 
toward creating the kind of engaging and dynamic learning environment that best serve students with a wide range of 
significant disabilities.

Based on a review of the data, we have identified Inclusive Leadership as a strength of our school. Additionally, two 
identified needs are teacher-principal trust (70%), and teacher-teacher trust (66%). In order to build upon the 
strength of inclusive leadership, the administrative team has put together a Professional Development Planning Team, 
including teachers and administrators, to plan our school's professional development for the 2018-2019 school year. 
This team will support us in addressing our need of cultivating trust between teachers and administrators, and 
amongst teachers.  

Additionally, the above referenced data support the following instructional priorities for the 2018-19 school year:

Student Attendance Rate Year to Date (2017-18) : 79.1% 

During the 2017-18 school year school leaders established a plan for creating a Parent and Family Engagement Inquiry 
Group, which was formed in November 2017. The Inquiry group held weekly meetings, which included teachers, 
administrators, parents, and students. In the fall the group engaged in an inquiry cycle around parent involvement. 
They created a survey which was distributed to parents and data relating to what parents would like to see at the 
school and how the school can increase parent involvement was analyzed. The group also conducted focus groups 
with students to learn more about how our students would like to see their parents involved. Based on the data 
collected, the group planned five parent events: two informational workshops (Front Door, Technology workshop), 
and three recreational events (December holiday party, VIP Day, Family Fun Day). During the 2016-2017 school year, 
our school averaged 14 parents at every event, and during the 2017-18 school year, our school was able to increase 
those numbers: 30 parents and families attended our VIP Day, and 50 parents and families attended our Family Fun 
Day. Due to the work of our Parent and Family and Family Engagement Inquiry Group, we have been able to identify 
Outreach to Parents and Parent Involvement in School as strengths, which we hope to build on during the 2018-2019 
school year. Our school plans to refine this work during the 2018-19 school year by continuing to engage in this 
inquiry work and bringing more stakeholders into the process.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 75M079, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

75M079 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and

M079's 2018-19 Title III program will target eighteen (18) English Language Learners (ELLs) 
for instruction. They have been selected based on their Entering-level NYSESLAT scores, and 
on their reliable attendance record. Students selected for participation in the program have IEP-
mandated instructional ratios of 12:1:1 and 6:1:1. Instruction will be delivered in English by 1 
certified bilingual/ESL teacher and 1 content area teacher.  Two paraprofessionals will support 
the program. It will be supervised by one assistant principal who will not be remunerated through 
Title III funds. The program will take place on Tuesdays and Thursdays beginning in February 
2019, and will run for 23 sessions. Program hours will be from 3:00pm-5:00pm (our school day 
ends at 2:50; this ten-minute gap will facilitate transition for our students, some of whom have 
mobility issues).  
Our goals for this targeted group of English Language Learners will be to advance their skills in 
literacy (specifically, summarizing, drawing inferences based on context clues, and following 
multiple events in a text) and mathematics (weights and measures). For the skill of writing and 
sub-skills of development, organization and language use, the learning targets will be: choosing 
and explaining relevant information from a text, direction and coherence, and effective use of 
words and sentence structure. 
In order to address these significant areas of need in our target population, we will utilize a 
Project Based Learning (PBL) culinary experience that is specifically developed to emphasize 
learning activities that are long-term, interdisciplinary, student-centered and integrated with real 
world issues and practices. The culinary component of our program will be based on the 
cookbook, "Five Ingredient Fix," which focuses on healthy recipes using five ingredients or less. 
Our teachers will use linguistic scaffolding and ENL methodologies such as Total Physical 
Response (TPR), as well as literacy methodologies such as Whole Language. In addition, we will 
use graphic organizers, the natural approach, and tactile activities.  These strategies will be used 
by the teachers to facilitate and improve language acquisition and communication skills that are 
tied to our goals.  
We will include a technology-based component in which students will use a computer lab to 
access multimedia programs to create a culinary instructional video. This will integrate 
standards-based instruction with the same goal of targeting language acquisition by using 
relevant and engaging technology based strategies.  A teacher in the math and science 
department will collaborate with a bilingual/ENL teacher to develop the Title 3 curriculum and 
deliver the content through the use of digital multimedia technology along with our culinary 
based instruction. We have selected this teacher for his expertise in the technology we will use 
for the Title III program. The standards to be addressed are CDOS Standard 1 - Career 
Development, Standard 2 - Integrated Learning and Standard 3a - Universal Foundation, as well 
as New Language Arts Progressions. 
Through PBL with a multimedia component, students apply and integrate the content areas to 
developing real world skills. Research reports that PBL had a positive effect on students with 
average to low verbal ability, and students with little previous content knowledge learned more 
in PBL classes than in traditional classes (Mergendoller, et al., 2006; Mioduser & Betzer, 2003). 
Blending technology with teachers to support interactive learning, exploration, and creation leads

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
to higher engagement and learning gains (Darling-Hammond, Zielezinski, & Goldman, 2014).In 
addition, special education students develop social skills such as patience and empathy (Belland, 
et al., 2006); and low ability students demonstrate initiative, management, teamwork and 
conscientiousness as they worked in groups (Horan, et al., 1996) 
 Assessment will consist of a teacher-made Project Based Rubric, checklists, video tape analysis, 
and teacher observations. Using recipes students, will sequence, summarize explain relevant 
information. They will learn to form complete sentences using the proper vocabulary terms in the 
targeted language of English. Students will also practice summarizing the steps in making their 
ingredient list and/or one to two step directions in preparing their dishes. 
The program will include a culminating activity scheduled for the last week. Parents as well as 
district representatives and P79M staff will be invited to part take in our formal dining 
experience where students will present their projects in a restaurant style presentation.

M079 will use Title III funds to conduct professional development workshops for all staff 
participating in the Title III supplemental instructional program (2 teachers, 2 paraprofessionals, 
1 supervisor). Professional development sessions will be joined and co-facilitated by Michelle 
Alvarez, unit coordinator and senior TBE teacher at M079. All three teachers involved with the 
program will facilitate four (4) workshops after school, for one hour (3:00 pm-4:00 pm) alternate 
Mondays throughout the program commencing one week prior to the instructional program. 
Professional Development will be ongoing and will include power points, research presentations, 
and oral presentations. The following topics will be among those explored at the 
workshops: Components of Project Based Learning; Creating Assessments/Data Driven 
Instruction; and Creating iMovies.  

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

 The parents of our ELL population will attend an orientation meeting the week  prior to the start 
of the program. This meeting will be held in English utilizing staff fluent in students' home 
language (Spanish) to interpret. This session will take place during the school day and will serve 
to inform parents about the Title III program as well as the opportunities being offered to parents 
through the Title III. Our parent coordinator, Ms. Caroline Mirabal, will work to provide parents

with meeting times, materials, resources in their native language. An administrator, Ms. 
Valentin, will provide an overall description of the program and extend a written and oral 
invitation to parents in their native language to come in and participate hands on with students 
during the Title III program. By attending the eleven-week Title III after school program, parents 
will have the ability to work alongside their children.  The parents will acquire strategies which 
will focus on "Kitchen Safety"; "How To Assist Students In working Independently in the 
Kitchen or with Minimum Support"; "iPads as Assistive Technology"; "How To Research"; and 
"Reading and Following Simple Recipes in English". A certified ENL teacher working the Title 
III program will reinforce these opportunities by providing two parent workshops which will 
focus on Safety in the Kitchen, as well as iPads as assistive technology based on the foundations 
and strategies from  books ordered through Title III funds. These workshops will take place in 
March 2019, and will take place during the school day. Parents will also be invited to participate 
in the culminating event of the Title III program. We will provide refreshments for parent 
meetings, offer MetroCards to parents who do not have their own transportation options, and we 
will provide each family with a copy of the book, "All Hands on Deck: Tools for Connecting 
Educators, Parents and Communities."

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
  English Language Learners are assessed using the SANDI/FAST, the Level One Interest and Preference Survey, School Survey, 
and teacher-made formative assessments.  Specific items in these assessment tools cross reference to skill sets highlighted in 
the New York State Alternate Assessment (Dynamic Learning Maps/Essential Elements), the New York State Career 
Development and Occupational Studies Standards (NYSCDOS), and the New and Home Language Arts Progressions (NYS 
Bilingual Common Core Initiative).  The SANDI/FAST modules highlights a wide variety of  Common Core Learning Standards 
(CCLS) aligned behaviors and learning targets for reading, writing, mathematics, communication, fine/gross motor, social 
emotional/behavioral, vocational, activities of daily living, and science needed for transition readiness (i.e., 21st Century Skills) 
across all environments upon graduation.  Developmental and grade level equivalents are determined following the establish 
criteria for conducting SANDI/FAST assessment (methods of assessment is teacher directed and observations and performance 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79 

 

levels 1 through 4 as indicated by scoring rubrics).  Teacher made materials aligned with the New Language Arts and Home 
Language Arts Progressions have been used to determine the levels of proficiency in the new language (NLA) and the levels of 
literacy in the home language (HLA) for the four modalities of language (reading, writing, listening, and speaking). Teachers use 
the information gathered from these assessment tools to identify students' academic needs, develop measurable annual and 
post-secondary IEP goals, determine coordinated sets of transition activities,  plan rigorous instruction based on the 
Danielson's Framework for Teaching, address the linguistic demands of the CCLS and the Instructional Shifts, provide access to 
curriculum ideas, lend the social emotional support, and select instructional strategies, materials and resources including 
curriculum programs, related services, and informational technology.  Other quantitative (student work, functional behavior 
analysis (FBAs), IEP updates, Report Cards, OORS/SWISS reports) and qualitative (interviews, anecdotals, referrals to least 
restrictive environments, Level One Interest and Preference Survey, etc.) data is also taken and continuously analyzed during 
team and professional assignment meetings. Results gathered from the analysis of these data sources inform next steps, i.e 
.the need to adjust or modify students' current instructional programs, as indicated in our current 2016-2017 Comprehensive 
Educational Plan. One of the insights provided by the data about our ELL population is the need to continue the use of the 
Language Experience Approach across learning environments, including community based instruction, (i.e, work study) to 
support access to the CCLS. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

P79M utilizes department meetings, 1/2 day professional development days, scheduled meetings on a "needs be" basis, with 
the instructional coordinator as well as, weekly progress monitoring "Data Thursday" information to support the systems and 
structures set forth to guide instructional planning for our English Language Learners. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Success of the ELL program is evaluated in a variety of ways.  The success of NLA and HLA programs for Ells is evaluated by the 
progress data made by ELLs towards linguistic proficiency on State summative (NYSESLAT, NYSAA) and local formative 
assessments (teacher-made materials). Ells' acquisition of functional literacy skills though NLA and HLA educational programs, 
is indicated by the IEP report of progress (measured 4 times a year). In addition Ell progress is based on the NYSITELL and 
NYSESLAT scores.  Data yield from the 2014-15 school year has evidenced that speaking and listening skills are Ells’ strong 
modalities, whereas  reading and writing remain areas of focus and require additional support.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

P79M utilizes department meetings, 1/2 day professional development days, scheduled meetings on a "needs be" basis, with 
the instructional coordinator as well as, weekly progress monitoring "Data Thursday" information to support the systems and 
structures set forth to guide instructional planning for our English Language Learners. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
P79M does not have grades K-5 at this time.  
    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 The Spring 2016 NYSESLAT revealed that out of 129 of our Ells that participated in the assessment one hundred and twenty 
seven (127) are at the Entering Level, one (1) is at the Emerging Level, and one (1) is at the Transitioning Level. Results also 
reveal students are making gains in the speaking modality of the exam.  Scores for the 2014-15 NYSAA revealed that 38% of 
the Ells participating in the assessment, attained Levels 3 and 4 in ELA (extensions).  **NOTE: PENDING SCORES FROM THE 
2017 ADMINISTRATION OF THE NYSESLAT and NYSAA. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

P79M utilizes department meetings, 1/2 day professional development days, as well as, scheduled meetings on a "needs be" 
basis, to support the systems and structures set forth to guide instructional planning for our English Language Learners

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

In our freestanding English as a New Language (ENL) program, ELLs follow the block organizational model within the 
context of cohorts. In the 6:1:1, 8:1:1, 12:1:1 Alternate and 12:1:4 service categories (staffing ratios) or cohorts, 
English Language Learners recommended for ENL only and for those in alternate placement, mandated ENL services 
are being provided through Stand-Alone ENL and Integrated ENL models. Classes across all service categories/cohorts 
are heterogeneous (mixed proficiency levels). Our ENL teachers follow a Stand Alone ENL model, as well as an 
Integrated ENL (team teaching) model. In the Stand Alone ENL model, students receive rigorous instruction based on 
the New Language Arts (NLA) progressions (NYS Bilingual Common Core Initiative) to acquire the English 
language/CALP (across the modalities of listening, speaking, reading, writing, and communicating ) needed to address 
the cognitive demands of the Common Core Learning Standards for ELA and Math, and the NYS Learning Standards 
for Science and Social Studies, with related services and supports. In the Integrated ENL model, students receive 
instruction in core content areas (ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies) and English language development instruction 
using a teacher collaboration model (team-teaching). In both models, the ENL provider and the classroom teacher 
collaborate to establish next steps for students, design coherent instruction, plan for rigor and access, develop quality 
Individualized Education Programs (IEPs).  As a result, the ELLs are given the opportunity to accelerate English 
language development across content areas and environments/settings for communication, self-advocacy, 
independence, self-regulation, and post-secondary success. ENL units of study are determined by the proficiency 
levels for ELLs based on their outcomes on the NYITELL and NYSESLAT and what are the required units as per NYS CR 
Part 154-2 (9-12). 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

 Our Transitional Bilingual Education program follows an alternate assessment high school organizational model based 
on cohorts (12:1:4, 6:1:1, 8:1:1, and 12:1:1 Alternate). The TBE program its comprised of three (3) components:  (1) 
Language Arts Instruction addressing units of study that includes Home Language Arts (HLA) based on the HLA 
progressions (Bilingual Common Core initiative), (2) English as a New Language (ENL) based on the  NLA progressions 
(Bilingual Common Core Initiative), and (3) Bilingual Content Area instruction in two (2) or more content areas. English 
Language Learners are grouped in self-contained, un-graded, and heterogeneous classes, travelling together, for the 
most part, using the block model, to clusters, work-study programs, and community based instruction according to 
their program schedules.  Classes across all service categories/cohorts are heterogeneous (mixed proficiency levels) to 
support peer-to-peer collaboration and feedback. Home Language Arts (HLA) and English as New Language (ENL) 
through ELA Math, Science, and Social Studies are listed in students' schedules as core subjects, with Getting Ready to 
Learn (GRTL), Adapted Physical Education (APE), Culinary Arts, Visual Arts, and Literature listed as clusters. Students 
across cohorts, including ELLs, participate in community based instruction and work-study experiences at various job 
sites.  Students in classes assigned to the work-study program report to their respective job sites according to their 
class schedule. In our TBE program students develop literacy proficiency, conceptual understanding, and procedural 
skills in their home language as they develop the English language (CALP) needed for the content areas. All instruction 
is Common Core (CCLS) and State Learning Standards  aligned and supported by related services, instructional 
strategies, materials, and age-appropriate resources. At the entering level, students receive 75% of instruction in their 
home language and 25% in English. Units of study are determined by proficiency levels based on what are the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81 

 

 

required units as per NYS CR Part 154-2 (9-12). 
  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

 Our Dual Language program follows an alternate assessment high school organizational model (12:1:1 Alternate). 
This program will follow the 50/50 design. All students in our DL education program will receive half of their 
instruction in Spanish and the other half in English. All participating students are expected to acquire both languages. 
The 50/50 language allocation ratio will remain constant throughout the program. As each cohort of students move 
up a grade each year, they will continue to receive 50/50 language instruction until they graduate at age 21. 
 
Two Self-Contained Classrooms: 
One 12:1:1 class will be instructed by a certified bilingual Spanish teacher  and one 12:1:1 class will be instructed by 
a  certified special education teacher with a side by side model. The class will be comprised of mostly ELLs-the one 
way model (heritage language students, Spanish dominant and English dominant students) rotate classrooms for 
different content/language instruction mid way through the school day.  
Students will participate in our Dual Language education program and be instructed in Spanish and in English until 
they graduate from the program(at age 21). An administrator who also holds bilingual certifications will oversee the 
program. Technical support and assistance with coordination of parent participation and parent/student activities will 
also be provided by other certified bilingual staff with expertise in this field (e.g., bilingual parent coordinator). 
Home Language Arts (HLA) and English as New Language (ENL) through ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies are 
listed in students’ schedules as core subjects. Students receive 50% instruction in English (ELA and Social Studies) and 
50% instruction in Spanish (Science and Math). Instruction is theme based and aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) in ELA and Math via DLM, the career Development Occupational Studies (CDOS) standards, Home 
Language Arts Progressions (HLAP), New Language Arts Progressions (NLAP), and IEP goals and access skills via the 
Student Annual Needs Determination Inventory (SANDI). 
   
  

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

English as a New Language (ENL), ELA and Home Language Arts (HLA) units of study are determined by CR Part 154-2 (9-12) 
requirements for English as a New Language (ENL) and Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) programs. These levels are 
designated based on the student scores on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT exams. There are five (5) proficiency levels; Entering, 
Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding. For the English as a New Language (ENL) model, students receive the 
following (minimum) ENL instructional time (units of study) per week for the following proficiency levels, grades 9-12: (A) 
Entering - 3 units (540 minutes), (B) Emerging - 2 units (360 minutes),  (C) Transitioning - 1 unit (180 minutes), (D) Expanding - 
1 unit (180 minutes), and (E) Commanding  - 0.5 unit (90 minutes) of integrated ENL in ELA/Core Content Area for an additional 
two (2) years. These units of study are also allocated into Stand-Alone ENL and Integrated ENL as per the NYS CR Part 154-2 (9-
12) breakdown. Students in a Transitional Bilingual Education program receive the following units of study per week in 
Language Arts and Bilingual Instruction for the following proficiency levels, grades 9-12: (A) Entering - 3 units of ENL (540 
minutes), 1 unit of HLA (180 minutes), and a minimum 2 units of Bilingual Content Area Subjects (360 minutes), (B) Emerging - 
2 units of ENL (360 minutes),  1 units of HLA (180 minutes, and a minimum of 2 units of Bilingual Content Area Subjects (360 
minutes), (C)Transitioning - 1 unit of ENL (180 minutes), 1 unit of HLA (180 minutes), and a minimum of 1 unit of Bilingual 
Content Area Subjects (180 minutes), (D) Expanding - 1 unit of ENL  (180 minutes), 1 unit of HLA (180 minutes, and a minimum 
of 1 unit of Bilingual Content Area Subjects (180 minutes),  and (E) Commanding level - 0.5 unit (90 minutes) of integrated ENL 
in ELA/Core Content Area for an additional two years. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          82 

 

 Content Area Instruction follows the P79M Blueprint for Teaching and Learning, the NYS Alternate Assessment (NYSAA) 
Dynamic Learning Maps/Essential Elements (Common Core aligned extensions for ELA and Math and Science  State Learning 
Standards/Alternate Grade Level Indicators for Social Studies), the NYS Career Development and Occupational Studies 
Standards (NYSCDOS), other State Learning Standards. The following curriculum programs are implemented across classroom 
to support instruction, promote rigor, and provide access are: Unique Learning System (N2Y), Attainment's, SMILE, and Equals. 
The bilingual teachers assigned to these classes are NYS certified and provide instruction in all content areas using the home 
language and ENL methodology with age appropriate materials and resources. English as a New Language (ENL) instruction 
follows the New Language Arts Progressions (Bilingual Common Core Initiative) and incorporates language development 
strategies (e.g., Total Physical Response, Language Experience Approach, Whole Language, Cooperative Learning), scaffolding 
techniques, Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles, realia and manipulatives, information technology resources, 
community-based instruction, work-study programs, and Title III activities. The use of technology (AAC devices, adapted 
switches, Smart boards) paired with Mayer Johnson symbols, software programs, and manipulatives are incorporated to give 
ELLs additional instructional support. Multi-sensory and multicultural materials are also infused throughout all aspects of 
instruction. Literacy and language development in English is also reinforced through the arts, social emotional programs and 
events (PBIS), and parent and community partnerships.  Students whose IEP indicates TBE services, but who are placed in 
alternate placement (monolingual classes with ENL support) are provided with the services of an Alternate Placement 
Educational Assistant proficient in the student's home language and English.   ELLs entitled to receive ENL-only services, 
receive ENL instruction according to the NYS CR Part 154-2 mandates for ENL Programs at the high school level. All ELLs placed 
in TBE classes are at the “Entering” level and receive a 25/75 ratio of Spanish to English instruction. By providing the 
recommended units of ENL instruction to ELLs in TBE classes performing at the Entering Level (High School), we ensure that 
they meet the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) and State Learning Standards, and attain Levels 3 and 4 in the State 
Alternate Assessment (NYSAA). The Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) program at P79M is composed of six (6) bilingual-
Spanish classes: Two (2) in the 12:1:4 cohort, two (2) in the 6:1:1 cohort, and two (2) in the 12:1:1 Alternate cohort.  The main 
focus of the TBE program at P79M is to provide ELLs with the linguistic support needed in content area instruction to 
accelerate English language development (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency) and literacy proficiency needed to 
address the expectations of the Common Core Learning Standards for transition readiness, including communication, self-
advocacy, positive choice-making (social emotional), self-regulation, and independence.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Formative assessments are conducted to ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the 
year. Formative assessment include teacher made materials aligned to the Home Language Arts (HLA) progressions (Bilingual 
Common Core Initiative), rubrics, teacher observation, and language inventories 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

The instructional design for all groups (SIFE, Newcomer, Developing, Long Term, and Former) include the use of flexible 
grouping, multi-sensory materials (e.g., manipulatives, realia, pictures), rigor (Depth of Knowledge) differentiation of 
instruction and access (Universal Design for Learning), and technology support (Smart boards, iPads, computers, software) to 
promote conceptual understanding and procedural knowledge of the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) and State 
Learning Standards, with the required adaptations and modifications.   Also, included in the instructional design are the 
implementation of specially tailored curriculum for students in alternate setting (e.g., Blueprint for Teaching and Learning, 
Unique Learning Systems, SMILE, Equals, Attainment, etc.) with the use of visual strategies and graphic organizers (including 
charts, tables, and graphs) and language development methodology (Total Physical Response, Language Experience Approach, 
Cooperative Learning, etc.). The same services available to Newcomers (0-3 years) are also afforded to our SIFE population and 
our ELLs who are receiving an extension of services, (4 - 6 years) and Long-Term ELLs. For these students (4-6 and 6+ years) 
school and community-based work study programs facilitate the acquisition of knowledge and skills required for post-
secondary success in all areas of transition (e.g., community integration, independent iiving, education/trainig, and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          83 

 

employment). Former ELLs, students who have been identified as ELLs and subsequently exited from ELL status, for at least 
two years following the school year in which the student is exited from ELL status, receive at least 0.5 unit of study (90 minutes 
per week) of English as a New Language.  
   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
As mentioned before, our program models consist of un-graded, heterogeneous, and block schedule groupings.  Because of 
this, teachers adapt and differentiate curriculum, resources, and materials according to students' chronological age, 
proficiency levels (IEPs,  teacher made materials, rubrics, Level 1 Vocational Assessment, SANDI/FAST, NYSESLAT, NYSAA, etc.) 
As stated in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP), ENL instruction for ELLs must follow elements of the P79M 
Blueprint for Teaching and Learning (our current curriculum map), the NYS Alternate Assessment (NYSAA-Dynamic Learning 
Maps/Essential Elements), State learning standards (including CDOS), Home Language Arts and New Language Arts 
Progressions, and NYS Performance Plan Indicator  13. 
    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The use of multi-sensory materials, realia, instructional strategies, and informational technology resources enhances and 
supports the acquisition of cognitive academic language proficiency (CALP) in English,  and related literacy skills, including 
expressive and receptive communication for students with special needs across service categories/cohort. Rigorous activities 
(DOK) are refined (UDL) and extended throughout the curriculum and content areas by combining the interdisciplinary/ 
thematic approach with language development strategies (e.g., Language Experience approach, Whole Language, Cooperative 
Learning, Emotional Literacy, etc.), multi-sensory materials (manipulatives, realia), infusion of the Arts, flexible grouping, and 
the use of technology (e.g., AAC devices, Smart boards, iPads, switches, etc.). School and classroom libraries are equipped with 
books in English and languages other than English (e.g., Spanish), including those adapted by teachers to address the academic 
needs of students with multiple, intellectual, and social-emotional challenges. 
  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 P79M has revised its Blueprint for Teaching and Learning for each of the cohorts (12:1:4, 8:1:1, 6:1:1, and 12:1:1 Alternate) in 
order to address the academic and social emotional needs of students with a focus on specific skills sets across content areas 
needed for post-secondary success, communication, independence, self-advocacy, work-readiness, ADL, and functional literacy 
through the use of rigorous age-respectful materials and activities, differentiation of instruction (UDL), and scaffolding 
techniques.  All students, including ELLs, are assessed using the SANDI/FAST assessment. The baseline data gathered from the 
assessment is used as a guide for informing IEP goals and tailoring instruction for ELLs.  ENL strategies, differentiation of 
instruction, scaffolding, community-based instruction, work-study programs, PBIS/Emotional Literacy, as well as using 
standards such as the NYSAA (Dynamic Learning Maps/Essential Elements) (CCLS),  State Learning Standards (including CDOS), 
and NLA and HLA progressions are all an integral part of the instruction provided to ELLs in the school. 
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 Our school community continues to explore options and find solutions for meeting the needs of our ELLs by addressing the 
wide range of cognitive and communication delays, engagement, social emotional needs, and behavioral challenges with the 
proper adaptations and modifications so that they can meet the expectations of Common Core and New York State Learning 
Standards. Our goal is to close the gap so that our students attain linguistic proficiency  and enhance their expressive and 
receptive communication skills which is needed for transition readiness and post-secondary success, as delineated in the 2014-
2015 Citywide Instructional Expectations and the Quality Review Rubric. We plan on improving and enhancing our existing 
programs by providing them with community-based learning experiences and more options for work-study programs, as well 
as developing the four language modalities by providing technology, multi-sensory materials, access, rigor, age-appropriate 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          84 

 

resources, and a variety of curriculum choices. 
    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

 At this time P79M has made no determination to discontinue any type of ELL service or program, but to enhance and build 
upon existing programs. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
As part of No Child Left Behind (NCLB), all ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs including but not limited to 
CHAMPS, Girl Be Heard, and Title III supplementary after-school program.  Notices to participate in these programs are sent 
home to parents/guardians in their preferred language and parents/guardians may select one or more programs that they 
would like for their child to participate in. Notices are also followed up by phone calls made to the home by school personnel 
who speak the home language confirming receipt of notices as well as participation in the program or to answer any questions 
that the parent/guardian may have. Periodic school assemblies, activities, and events are also available for our ELLs to 
participate in. Teachers are informed of such events through our staff weekly newsletter and share the information with 
students as well as posters and advertisements that are posted around our school community informing students of such 
events. Parents/guardians are kept informed of such events by their monthly parent newsletter and Parent Association 
meeting announcements.s part of No Child Left Behind (NCLB), all ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs 
including but not limited to CHAMPS, Girl Be Heard,  Youth Step USA and Title III supplementary after-school program. Notices 
to participate in these programs are sent home to parents/guardians in their preferred language and parents/guardians may 
select one or more programs that they would like for their child to participate in. Notices are also followed up by phone calls 
made to the home by school personnel who speak the home language confirming receipt of notices as well as participation in

share the information with students as well as posters and advertisements that are posted around our school community 
informing students of such events. Parents/guardians are kept informed of such events by their monthly parent newsletter and 
Parent Association meeting announcements. 
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 We continue to provide technology resources (e.g., Smart boards, AAC devices, i-pads, software, adapted switches, etc.) to 
accelerate English language development and literacy proficiency through content area and ENL and HLA instruction to 
develop communication, self-advocacy, self -regulation, independence, and transition readiness skills,  to students across 
service categories, using the NLA and HLA progressions (Bilingual Common Core Initiative). Multi-sensory and multicultural age 
appropriate materials are also infused throughout all aspects of the instructional day to support acquisition of identified skill 
sets for post-secondary success.   
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home Language Arts instruction is parallel to the literacy instruction imparted in monolingual classes, and is provided by the 
bilingual teacher using materials and resources aligned to the Home Language Arts (HLA) progressions.  Home Language Arts 
instruction in the four modalities (reading, writing, listening, and speaking) emphasizes the development of expressive and 
receptive communication skills and reading comprehension and writing skills across the content areas (through a balanced, 
integrated literacy model, age-respectful materials and activities, and transition readiness skills) for post-secondary 
success.  Home language support is also evident throughout the organization of bilingual classrooms, Alternate Placement 
Educational Assistants, and in-classroom libraries. The main school libraries, as well as the classroom libraries, contain books in 
the home language as well as in English. There is a collection of fiction and non-fiction titles depicting the various cultures and 
backgrounds of the students. These books are available to the entire school population as well as videos and movies depicting 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          85 

 

aspects of different cultures that are made available to the teachers. 
  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 All ELLs in TBE, ENL and DL programs, regardless of the subgroup, age or grade, benefit from targeted Academic Intervention 
Services (AIS) that the school has set in place to supplement instruction provided for the purpose of and assisting students in 
meeting the Common Core Learning Standards (NYSAA-Dynamic Learning Maps/Essential Elements) and State learning 
standards (Science, Social Studies, etc). This additional support is provided using a variety of programs (Unique Learning 
System, Attainment, Equals, Smile), age appropriate materials, language development strategies, informational technology, 
and Title III after-school programs. These services are made available to ELLs with severe disabilities on the same basis as non-
disabled students, and shall be consistent with the ELL's Individualized Education Program (IEP) to address barriers to 
improved academic performance and move to least restrictive settings. 
  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 We continue to provide technology resources (e.g., Smart boards, AAC devices, i-pads, software, adapted switches, etc.) to 
accelerate English language development and literacy proficiency through content area and ENL and HLA instruction to 
develop communication, self-advocacy, self -regulation, independence, and transition readiness skills,  to students across 
service categories, using the NLA and HLA progressions (Bilingual Common Core Initiative). Multi-sensory and multicultural age 
appropriate materials are also infused throughout all aspects of the instructional day to support acquisition of identified skill 
sets for post-secondary success. 
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
For students enrolled in P79M we offer our Chapter 683 summer program, where students can participate in receiving 
mandated ELL services to support skill maintenance, such as TBE and ENL programs, as well as Summer Youth Employment, 
and Work Study options. Throughout the year these services are offered as well as our Title III, Youth Step USA,  Girl Be Heard 
and Champs programs. 
 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

P79M does not offer any language electives at this time. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

P79Ms Dual Language program will use the side by side, self contained model. Our dual language 
program will follow a 50/50 model where instruction will be conducted in Spanish 50% of the time and in 
English the remaining 50% of the time. Students will be in instructed in English in the subject areas of 
Social Studies and ELA. They will be instructed in Spanish in the subject areas of Math and Science. 
Teachers will maintain a separation of languages for instruction however, there will be bilingual 
paraprofessionals to support our native speakers. There will be flexible grouping and differentiation as

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
P79M's professional development plan includes training on topics pertaining to the education of ELLs, such as: SESIS;  Writing 
Quality IEPs; NYS PP #13; Common Core Learning Standards (NYSAA Frameworks) and the Instructional Shifts; ADVANCE 
Teacher Evaluation and Development System; Danielson Framework for Teaching; Emotional Literacy/PBIS 
programs;  Attainment; Balanced Literacy; Unique Learning System (n2y); Smile curriculum program; Equals curriculum 
program; SANDI/FAST assessments; CFI Inquiry Cycle and Data Analysis protocols; Student Centered Planning; Technology 
Integration; NYS CR Part 154; Bilingual Arts Progressions; Language Development Methodology; Differentiation of Instruction; 
Universal Design for Learning; Depth of Knowledge; TEACCH/Structured Teaching; Quality Review Compliance; etc.  In addition, 
the Office of English Language Learners at District 75 Office hosts a series of professional development courses for teachers of 
ELLs and school staff is encouraged to register for these courses using the online D75 Professional Development catalog. After 
teachers attend these trainings, the information is disseminated to all staff through faculty, team, and professional assignment 
meetings.  The purpose is for all school staff who are involved with ELLs, to be aware of curriculum programs, assessment 
tools, resources, materials, and teaching strategies that will support Ells meet their IEP goals and achieve transition readiness, 
i.e. literacy and language skills, self-advocacy, independence, self-regulation, positive choice-making, and increased 
communication to achieve post-secondary success.  In addition, all new teachers are required to complete ten (10) hours of 
mandated Jose P. training. Teachers and educational assistants serving ELLs will also be supported through professional 
development provided by coaches from the District 75 Office of Ells. In addition, given the opportunity and availability of 
funds, P79M will promote and encourage attendance of staff to National , State, and City conferences (NABE, SABE, TESOL) 
focusing on the education of ELLs. Classroom teachers, ENL providers, and other related services (Speech, OT, and PT) provide 
support and gather quantitative and qualitative data as students transition from middle school to high school (e.g., IEP; 
SANDI/FAST; NYSESLAT; NYSAA; rubrics, teacher made materials, etc.). Additional support will be provided by professional 
development opportunities based on the Title III after-school program.   P79M's professional development for teachers of ELLs 
includes training on topics pertaining to the education of ELLs, such as: SESIS;  Writing Quality IEPs; NYS PP #13; Common Core 
Learning Standards (NYSAA Dynamic Learning Maps/Essential Elements) and the Instructional Shifts; ADVANCE Teacher 
Evaluation and Development System; Danielson Framework for Teaching; Emotional Literacy/PBIS programs;  Attainment; 
Balanced Literacy; Unique Learning System (n2y); Smile curriculum program; Equals curriculum program; SANDI/FAST 
assessments; CFI Inquiry Cycle and Data Analysis protocols; Student Centered Planning; Technology Integration; NYS CR Part 
154; Bilingual Arts Progressions; Language Development Methodology; Differentiation of Instruction; Universal Design for 
Learning; Depth of Knowledge; TEACCH/Structured Teaching; Quality Review Compliance; etc. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Supports include but are not limited to providing professional development and trainings on a wide range of instructional 
topics, opportunities for teacher collaboration and Inquiry, a supportive environment and a school culture based on high 
expectations and respect, opportunities for establishing strong family and community partnerships, opportunities for 
leadership and participation in the decision-making process to affect change.  Our school district sponsors Professional 
Development trainings to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs of or ELLS. A minimum of 1% of 
the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by NYS CR Part 80 is dedicated to language 
acquisition. For all bilingual and ENL teachers a minimum of 5% of the required professional development hours is dedicated to 
language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction. Professional development includes but is not limited to; 
Jose P. Training, Promoting English Language Acquisition for ELLs with Disabilities, Fostering Independent Living Skills for ELLs

with Disabilities, Nuts and Bolts for ENL and bilingual teachers with 2 years of service or less, Using Teaching Collaboration to 
support the Needs of ELLs with Disabilities, and Nuts and Bolts of Home Language Arts. Professional assignments are 
formatted to support implementation and refinement of Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) initiative for transition 
readiness and language and literacy development.  Records are kept by the archieving of agendas, sign-in sheets, and any 
handouts that may have been provided at the training. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We offer parents/guardians training through the NYSABE Parent Institute and District 75 Parent Conferences with the support 
of a translator, if needed.  Parents also participate in the School's Leadership Team where issues are bought forth concerning 
the academic well-being of all students at P79M. Parents and students meet with teachers during scheduled IEP conferences, 
parent workshops, school events, and Title III after-school programs. Parents/guardians also learn how to use data reports to 
monitor students' progress.  Parents/guardians attend a Title III orientation meeting prior to the initiation of the program to 
receive information about the goals of the program and the curriculum materials being used. The School Messenger system 
and parent newsletter allow for continuing communication between the school and parents/guardians. School staff is 
encouraged to maintain ongoing communication with parents/guardians to provide them with up-to-date information about 
students and to get them involved in school activities and events.  In order to evaluate the needs of parents/guardians, the 
following tools are currently being implemented: School Survey, IEP conferences, parent-teacher conferences, informal 
surveys, professional development, School Leadership Team (SLT) meetings; school events, etc. The qualitative and 
quantitative data resulting from these assessment tools is analyzed to inform next steps for increasing parental 
involvement.  The school community is constantly problem-solving solutions for increasing parental involvement through 
activities that will develop a strong sense of community and partnership, and will provide parents/guardians with needed 
information, resources, technical assistance, and emotional support and guidance.   Records of individual meetings are 
recorded as follows; parent call logs are kept for calls made home to parents in the main office, sign in sheets are kept for in-
person meetings and copies of parent/guardian outreach letters are kept on file by our Parent Coordinator, Ms. Carmen Reyes 
Quiniones and our ELL Liaison Ms. Michelle Alvarez. 
  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
ELL parents/guardians of the P79M community are invited to attend town hall meetings, participate in school leadership team 
meetings, school safety meetings, and parent association meetings. During the course of the school year parents/guardians are 
invited to participate in various classroom activities,  school PBIS events, as well as participate throughout our Title III after-
school program and culminating event. We have a Parent Coordinator, Carmen Reyes Quiniones, that works to support 
parents with any assistance they need regarding day-to-day needs that may arise, agency support as well as transitional 
services (along side our Transition Coordinator Ms. Michelle LeFaivre). This school year we hope to build upon and continue a 
parent program that began during the 2016-17 school year with Title III Immigrant Funding where parents get to participate in 
a four week program that revolves around Art education along with their child.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Greer Phillips, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The language needs of the parents at P79M are identified using a variety of methods. ATS is utilized for the initial 
identification of home languages other than English spoken by parents. In addition, information of parent 
language needs is collected from other sources such as:  

- Evaluations and Surveys completed by parents during parent meetings, parent conferences and other parent 
activities.  

- Language needs identified by parents to the Parent Coordinator during individual and group meetings.  

-Language needs identified and discussed during Parent Association meetings. 

- Language needs identified by parents to the teachers during conferences.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          92 

 

-Language needs identified and discussed during IEP meetings. 

- Language needs as determined by language of written communication to teachers and other staff received from 
parents.  

- Review of translated written correspondence sent home to parents.  

- Language needs identified by parents on the Blue emergency cards sent home to be filled out.  

During the initial student admission/intake, the parent is asked to complete Home Language Survey (HLIS) in their 
native language, if this is the child's first time entering a New York City Department of Education School. On the 
HLIS document, a parent is requested to indicate their preferred language in receiving oral communication and 
written information from the school.  

Consequently, the Parent Coordinator makes certain that there is communication with the families and guardians 
of ELLs by providing translated school documents and any other information that needs to be sent home. In 
addition, interpretation services will be provided, as it is needed in the foreign languages that the Department of 
Education offers. Translators will be available to come to the school, or be accessible by phone, with any of the 
translation or interpretation needs of the ELL parent.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

To ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663, as well as, resources 
available to meet compliance, P79M will utilize our first faculty conference to review and inform staff of the 
regulations and resources to meet compliance. Furthermore, a separate meeting will be held with the coordinators in 
charge of various departments i.e., IEP Coordinator, Transition Coordinator, Parent Coordinator, ELL Liaison etc. to 
further establish the protocols that will be put in place to ensure staff members are reminded of established criteria 
pertaining to compliance. Lastly, a copy of the Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 will be placed in our staff weekly 
newsletter reinforcing the guidelines and protocols relating to ELL compliance.

quality and availability of translation and interpretation services. This feedback forms will be provided and informal 
questioning will be conducted as parents attend regularly scheduled face to face meetings. Surveys will be sent home 
twice within the given school year. Also, parent association board members meet regularly with administrators to 
share and troubleshoot parental concerns.
