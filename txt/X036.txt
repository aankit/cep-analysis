Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

P.S. 36 is a school committed to building the confidence and perseverance of each student that enters its doors. We 
believe that we must encourage our students to become risk-takers and critical thinkers. We will nurture our students 
as they overcome their fears and discover they can be leaders of their own learning. By strengthening teacher 
practice and engaging our students in learning, we will inspire our students to become independent lifelong learners. 
We value a respect for diversity and believe that when educators, parents, and students work together for the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

purpose of personal and academic success, we can motivate our students to “Reach for the Stars” and achieve their 
dreams. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S. 36 is an elementary school in Good Standing located in the Castle Hill Section of the Bronx. Student enrollment is 
approximately 740 students in Grades PreK-5. Students from P.S. 36 come from many diverse backgrounds comprising 
of approximately 62% Hispanic, 23% Asian, 10% Black, and 3% White. Our population includes approximately 15% 
English Language Learners and 20% students with disabilities. We are a Title 1 school serving families with over 75% of 
our students from low income homes.  

P.S. 36 is committed to creating a safe, engaging, and structured environment for students to cultivate their learning. 
Students are expected to meet the Next Generation State Standards (NGSS) through the use of scaffolds and rigorous 
curriculum. Our highly qualified educators collaboratively plan to provide students with targeted instruction to meet 
their learning needs. Teachers meet on a weekly basis during common preps, grade level and vertical teams, and 
professional learning time to look at student work and assessments which inform their plans for effective instruction. 
Students are provided targeted supports in small groups using researched based strategies and interventions such as 
guided reading, Spire, Fundations, and Sounds in Motion. Teachers engage in professional learning cycles in school 
and constantly seek additional professional development workshops and courses to refine their practice. We have 
partnerships with Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) and are currently in Year 2 as a TCRWP 
Project School which allows us to bring Teacher's College consultants to work with our teachers in improving their 
craft. In addition, we partner with National Training Network's (NTN) math consultancy to support our 
implementation of two new math programs enVisions Math and Key Elements to Mathematics Success (KEMS). 

School leaders believe that decision-making should include all stakeholders. Working with families and teachers is 
necessary to formulate a cohesive vision and plan for school improvement. Parents and educators are encouraged to 
lead through running committees, workshops, grade level teams, and facilitating professional learning opportunities. 
School leaders encourage the growth of learning for parents through workshops revolving around the standards and 
sharing strategies to help support students at home while increasing family engagement and empowerment in the 
school community. School leaders encourage educator growth through regular observations and feedback cycles to 
improve their instruction and encourage teachers to develop their own leadership skills by facilitating workshops and 
professional learning groups for their peers and for parents.  

At P.S. 36, we believe in educating the whole child and providing a well-rounded program which includes addressing 
the students’ social and emotional development. We are a Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) 
school creating a climate of STAR behavior: Safe, Truthful, Alert, Respectful. We will infuse RULER supported by the 
Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence where students and faculty will practice RULER: Recognizing emotions in self 
and others, Understanding the causes and consequences of emotions, Labeling emotions accurately, Expressing 
emotions appropriately, Regulating emotions effectively. Students practice these skills through daily instruction 
(Feelings Word Curriculum), Book of the Month, and interactions with peers and adults. Families will participate in 
RULER through parent workshops, book clubs, and Monthly RULER home connection homework. Our students 
participate in community programs and service as well. For example, select students partake in the Heart Program 
which focuses on environmental, animal and human rights. Select students also give back to the community by 
visiting Oddfellows weekly to spend time with the elderly. Our Green Team and Student Council collaborated on the 
Healthy Bodegas Project which reached out to a local bodega and found ways for it to offer healthier choices to its 
customers in the community. Throughout the year, students also commit themselves to service projects such as food 
and coat collections, and community gardening. 

In addition, we are committed to providing our students with experiences in the Arts. We have a full-time music 
teacher providing a range of music instruction and experiences such as participating in chorus and Music Memory, 
learning to play the keyboard and attending performances at Lincoln Center. We also have a full-time visual arts

teacher who provides a range of projects in various mediums culminating in art gallery shows, competitions, and 
submissions to Artsonia.com. In addition, our artists were invited to showcase their art in the Metropolitan Museum 
of Art, Times Square Art Showcase, and the Bronx Borough Arts Festival held at Lehman College. This past year, our 
school hosted dance teaching artists from AATT Bronx Dance Academy to provide multicultural dance instruction for 
grades K-5. The Arts Department heavily collaborated with all grade levels to produce grade-wide assemblies that 
highlighted areas of curriculum. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our evolving Bronx school serves a diverse population of students which includes families from various ethnic 
backgrounds, English Language Learners (ELLs), and students with disabilities (SwDs). 

Our ELL students come from many different countries such as Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Bangladesh, 
and Afghanistan. The languages spoken include Spanish, Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, and Thai. Our students are at the 
following levels of proficiency: 19 students entering, 17 students emerging, 21 students transitioning, and 41 students 
expanding. We have two English as a New Language (ENL) teachers who service students in grades K-5 as well as 
several teachers who are dual-certified in TESOL: Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages. In addition, we 
provide our teachers with training to provide ENL supports such as scaffolds, visuals, and total physical response 
strategies. 

Our SwD have a range of disabilities which include Speech and Language Delay, Intellectually Disabled, Other Health 
Impaired, and Emotionally Disabled. We provide many services on the Continuum of Special Education Services such 
as Related Services, SETSS: Special Education Teacher Support Services, ICT: Integrated Co-Teaching, and 12:1:1 
services. Related Services include speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, hearing 
services, and adaptive physical education. Instructional and management needs include scaffolds and modifications to 
the curriculum, small group instruction, multi-sensory instruction, and behavior implementation plans. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our greatest area of growth within the Framework for Great Schools is in Collaborative Teachers. By providing 
teachers with common planning time and using protocols to strengthen teams, our educators collaborated to plan for 
the successful implementation of the Teacher's College Reading and Writing units. In addition to planning, our 
teachers attended Teacher's College Calendar days and brought back information to turn-key to their team members. 
Through professional learning cycles led by Teacher's College coaches, educators participated in classroom visits, 
learning walks, and met in teams to analyze student work and determine next steps. 

An area of focus this year is in Rigorous Instruction. Our school’s instructional focus is productive struggle with an 
emphasis on deepening student comprehension of cognitively challenging material by building student independence, 
and engaging in active discussion and effective assessment practices. Across all content areas, our focus will be In 
building independence in learning. Students will participate in group work with teacher facilitation, independent 
rigorous tasks, and activities to increase their readiness to engage in higher order discussions and self/peer 
assessment. This readiness should increase proficiency in students exhibiting higher-order levels of comprehension.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
The grade-by-grade strengths and needs are as follows based on 2017-2018 Go Math chapter test data and KEMS 
module assessment data: 

  The largest need area for Grade K is demonstrated in representing and counting two-digit numbers. The 
success rate decreases when counting numbers 11 to 19. With an average chapter test score of 80.3 for 
representing and counting numbers 11 to 19, this is still the lowest average chapter test score. However, it is 
a gain of 3.7 percentage points compared to last year's average. Focus on subitizing strategies should result in 
continued improvement. 

  The largest need area for Grade 1 is building on addition and subtraction relationships , with an average 

chapter test score of 76.1. Increased use of ten frames might provide additional support. 

  The largest need area for Grade 2 is 2-digit subtraction, with an average chapter test score of 75.6, a gain of 2 

percentage points above last year's average but still tied for lowest in the grade with money and time. 
Regrouping strategies involving manipulatives will aid the former. Increased emphasis on the Mathematical 
Practices through enVision problem solving will build on skills in these areas in 2018-19. 

  The largest need area for Grade 3 out of the major cluster areas is in KEMS Module 8: Understanding, 
comparing and forming equivalent fractions. This average was 73.4. An increased emphasis on visual 
representations, legal trades and the mathematical practices through enVision will be incorporated next year. 

  The largest need area for Grade 4 is dividing by 1-digit numbers. The average chapter test score was 54.5. 

enVision, KEMS and EngageNY resources will all be explored in 2018-2019 in lieu of Go Math. 

  The largest need area for grade 5 was determined based on the student performance in KEMS Module 8, 

which included fraction word problem solving using all 4 operations. Increased use of EngageNY released test 
questions in this area along with increased emphasis on the Mathematical Practices through enVision will 
build on this area in 2018-19. 

  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

By applying mathematical practices to solve higher order word problems, it is expected that the percentage of students 
on grade level will increase by 12 percentage points as compared by the Fall 2018 enVision baseline assessment to the 
June 2019 enVision end of year benchmark assessment.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, we had an increase of 8 points, with a total of 81% of of survey 
participants who rated classroom behavior as positive. While our overall score in classroom behavior was 3.80, 12% 
higher than city average, we believe that classroom behavior must continue to improve in order for learning to occur. 
In addition , we saw a decrease from 44 to 39 incident reports in OORS with a decrease in discipline infractions. 
Although we generally have a positive school culture, we will focus on improving our adults' and students' ability to 
support each other and regulate their emotions in positive ways. Research has shown that students who develop not 
only their academic behaviors but also their social behaviors learn skills needed for academic success and career 
readiness. We will continue to implement Yale University's concept of RULER in daily instruction. RULER is an acronym 
that stands for Recognizing, Understanding, Labeling, Expressing, and Regulating emotions. Our hope is that RULER 
will become an integral and enduring part of our school community. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, staff members will incorporate the anchors of emotional intelligence into the school culture resulting in 
a 15% increase in teachers’ and students’ ability to regulate actions as measured by comparing the fall 2018 baseline 
RULER survey to the end of year 2019 RULER survey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Professional Learning Communities have been designed with need areas demonstrated through district feedback, 
teacher needs assessments and instructional data. Based on the NYS Common Core 2017-18 ELA state test scores, all 
grades increased by 17.9 percentage points in terms of students on grade level as compared to the 2016-17 school 
year. Also, based on the NYS Common Core state test, 2017-18 Math scores for all grades increased by 6.5 percentage 
points in terms of students on grade level as compared to the 2016-17 school year. In ELA (2017-18), our average 
growth percentile for fourth and fifth grade students was 53.73%. In Math (2017-18), our average growth percentile 
was 55.23%. 

Regarding areas of need, specific areas in Math from 2017-18 include (with percentage points below the city average 
in parentheses) standards 3.MD.7d (-.11), 3.NF.3c (-.07), 3.OA.8 (-.07), 4.MD.6 (-.15), 4.MD.7 (-.16), 4.NF.1 (-.13), 
4.OA.3 (-.09), 5.OA.2 (-.13) and 5.MD.5b (-.08). Looking at patterns or trends from this data as well as data from prior 
years, standards 3.OA.8, 4.OA.3 and 5.OA.2 all involve multistep problem solving or multiple operations within an 
expression. Equivalent fractions and angle measures have also been in a downward trend from the city average for 
several years. Hence, enhanced math discussion techniques will be studied through the 5 Practices for Orchestrating 
Productive Mathematical Discussions. These should be especially applicable in the area of multi-step problem solving 
that our school has struggled with for several years (e.g. standard 4.OA.3, -.21 from the NYC average in 2016-17). 

In terms of ELA from 2017-18 (with percentage points below the city average in parentheses), areas of focus include 
standards L.3.4 (-.12), RI.3.2 (-.05), RI.3.5 (-.05), RL.3.2 (-.05), L.4.4 (-.06), RI.4.3 (-.07), RL.4.6 (-.06), RL.4.4 (-.06), RL.4.6 
(-.07), RI.5.3 (-.07), RI.5.7 (-.06), RI.5.5 (-.11). Commonalities across grades include determining word meaning, finding 
main idea and utilizing structure. 

Teachers also indicated in our needs assessment survey and through vertical teams that our reading curriculum 
needed additional supports to better target the needs of our struggling students.  In order to increase our student 
achievement levels in ELA, we are continuing with Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP. As a 
Teacher's College Project school, we will be supported by TC Professional Learning Conference days, Learning 
Institutes as well as TC Consultants by grade bands. In addition, we will be utilizing and learning about the The 
Continuum of Literacy Learning to target the reading needs of students in small groups. This continuation of 
professional learning will increase our students ability to read and comprehend complex text, increase vocabulary, 
and build writing stamina. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.

By June 2019, targeted math and literacy professional learning cycles will be implemented to improve instructional 
strategies that will result in at least a 5% increase of teachers who receive 2018-2019 end of year MOTP ratings of 
effective or highly effective in components 3b: Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques, 3c: Engaging Students in 
Learning, or 3d: Using Assessment in Instruction on Advance as compared to the 2017-2018 end of year MOTP ratings.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In 2017-2018, Advance data indicated Domain 2 and 3 as an area of continued improvement particularly with new 
and untenured teachers. Overall for all teachers, domain 3 were areas of need. The primary components in Domain 3 
are 3b: Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques, 3c: Engaging Students in Learning, or 3d: Using Assessment in 
Instruction. Overall end year Advance data indicated that 95.5% of teachers were rated effective in component 3b 
while only 2.3% were rated highly effective. In component 3c, 84.1% of teachers were rated effective while only 9.1% 
were rated highly effective. In component 3d, 86.4% of teachers were rated effective while only 11.4% were rated 
highly effective. Thus, in 2018-2019, we continue with the ultimate goal of supporting all teachers but with a focus on 
supporting new and untenured teachers to strengthen their pedagogy in classroom culture, managing student 
behavior, discussion, engagement, and assessment techniques.. Teachers will improve strategies through coaching, 
observation cycles and feedback. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, as a result of school leader’s implementation of frequent observations, feedback cycles, and 
mentoring/coaching, at least 90% of new and untenured teachers will show at least 1 level’s performance growth in the 
HEDI scale in at least 3 components in Domain 2 and 3 on the Danielson Rubric as measured by the 2018 baseline 
Advance observation compared to the 2019 end of school year observation.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our school has shown a need for increased parental involvement in order to understand and support student learning 
at home. Students are struggling with deeper levels of student comprehension and higher order thinking and need 
additional support from parents to help them persevere through more complex text and curriculum. According to our 
2017-2018 school survey results, 99% of parents have a positive outlook under Outreach to Parents and 95% of 
parents say they are satisfied with Parent Involvement. However, we always strive to do better and to maintain 
positive relationships with our parents. As a result, we will focus on continuing to offer services, programs, and 
workshops with a focus on increasing attendance and increasing parents' ability to feel empowered and confident in 
supporting their child at home. As voiced in SLT meetings, parents would like an increase in the variety of workshops 
offered. We as a school would also like to offer cycles of learning that can build on skills throughout the year. When 
parents feel a part of the school community, they are more likely to attend more workshops, learn more strategies, 
and be able to support their child with learning and advocate for their needs. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, there will be at least a 10% increase in the number of parents attending school-wide meetings, events, 
and activities as measured by the 2018-2019 Parent Coordinator Activity Report compared to the 2017-2018 Parent 
Coordinator Activity Report.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Teaching candidates are hired centrally by the NYCDOE. As described in the NYCDOE Consolidated Application, this 
process ensures that all NYCDOE teachers meet State eligibility requirements. Schools, in turn, ensure that teachers 
are HQT, as defined by No Child Left Behind (NCLB). Educators are assigned by license and areas of strengths and 
expertise. 

 

Teachers are recruited at fairs, open market, through relationships with universities and through recommendations. 
When hiring, teachers are asked to interview, bring a portfolio, and teach a lesson which includes a feedback process. 
Once hired, teachers are given training and support through a multitude of means such as: New Teacher Network , 
Coaching with onsite and offsite coaches, provided a buddy mentor,attend PD on and off-site, participate in weekly 
teacher team meetings, frequent intervisitations with highly effective teachers, and given frequent observations with 
timely feedback. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
In order to maintain and support a highly qualified staff the following practices are in place: 

 

Seek educators with a strong background in Balanced Literacy, knowledge of the Next Generation State 
Standards that can align their practices to the P.S. 36 vision and mission. 

  Educators that believe in a professional learning community 
  Motivated to continue their professional learning 
  Willing to share best practices, be self-reflective and have high expectations of themselves and their students 
School personnel work closely with the BFSC team to ensure that non-HQT meets all required documentation 
 
and assessment deadlines. 

  External Professional development is provided to support staff in helping their students meet the demands of 

the common core state standards. 

  Mentors/Peer Coaches provide support for teachers. 
  New Teacher Network professional development is provided for new staff.

  Differentiated Professional Development is provided based on a Needs Assessment Survey as well as Teacher 

observations. 

In addition, highly qualified staff are encouraged to become leaders of their own learning. Staff are asked to 
participate in shared decision-making and the administration provides ample opportunities for distributive leadership. 
Professional learning is differentiated based on the need and learning style of the educator. Throughout the year, 
staff have some opportunity to choose which professional learning opportunity to participate in.

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
3 teachers, 3 paraprofessionals, a parent coordinator, a social worker, Create Consultant, UFT Literacy Coach, Library 
Media Specialist, and a NYC instructional support coach support our Universal Pre-K program. The social worker works 
with the classroom staff and families to identify early intervention for students as well as assistance for families in 
crisis. The social worker provides parent workshops that focus on the academic and social development of the 
students as well as increasing parental involvement and engagement.  

In our three pre-K classrooms, both the teacher and paraprofessionals, work in small groups with the children 
conducting ongoing observations during centers, whole group and small group instruction. This year, we will continue 
to incorporate the Teaching Strategies Gold Assessment in conjunction with the integrated NYC Units/Creative 
Curriculum, which are investigatory units of study. Our PreK will also be continuing with Building Blocks, a math 
program. We will participate in the Create Instructional Track which will support the integration of the arts into the 
curriculum units. Our staff will attend Kindergarten Grade conferences and professional development with 
Kindergarten teachers to set goals for the students to prepare them for Kindergarten. The Pre-K staff will articulate 
with the kindergarten teachers about their students and review the student portfolio of work prior to them entering 
kindergarten.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 36 Unionport in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

 

P.S. 36x will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 


  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community; 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

P.S 36X's Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  Title I Priority and Focus Schools and the parents of students served in the Title I program must jointly agree 
upon the use of these additional funds to support increased parent engagement/education to enable parents 
to effectively support their child’s learning. 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; 

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; 
conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
Rationale: 
The objective of the Title III after school program is to improve students' reading skills, writing 
skills, and the use and understanding of Math vocabulary.  After analyzing our latest data, 
including last year’s NYSESLAT results and state test scores, we have concluded that many of 
our students need additional support in reading, writing, and math. These students will receive 
additional targeted and differentiated instruction during after school to help meet their academic 
needs. One hour will be dedicated to literacy and the second hour will be dedicated to the 
language of Math. 
 
Subgroups and Grade Levels of Students to be Served: 
Our focus population for our Title III after school program will be newcomers, current and 
former ENL students in grades 3, 4, and 5. Fifty-one entitled ELLs will participate in this 
program, in addition to twenty former ELLs. 
 
Schedule and Duration: 
Our Title III ELL After school Program for grades 3, 4, and 5 will pick up from December 5, 
2018 through April 30, 2019 for a total of 34 days. The program will be held on Wednesdays and 
Thursdays from 2:45 PM to 4:45 PM.   
The sessions go as following: 
December 5, 6, 12, 13, 19, & 20  
January 2, 3, 9, 10, 16, 17, 23, 24, 30, & 31 
February 6, 7, 13, 14, 27, & 28 
March 6, 7, 13, 14, 20, 21, 27, & 28 
April 10, 11, 17, & 30 
 
Language of Instruction: 
The language of instruction is English and the instruction is provided by our ESOL and Bilingual 
certified teachers, as well as our common branch certified teacher.   
 
Number and Types of Certified Teachers: 
Both direct instruction and direct supplemental services are provided by the following teachers; 
Ms. Otero, Ms. Delgado , and Mr. Tenaglia. Ms. Otero is our ESOL certified teacher servicing 
4th and 5th grade, Ms. Delgado holds a bilingual certification and services 3rd grade, and 
Mr. Tenaglia is our common branch teacher who collaborates with Ms. Otero and works with 4th 
and 5th grade. During our Title III after school program, Ms. Delgado services 3rd grade during 
both the ELA and math periods. In addition, Ms. Otero and Mr. Tenaglia rotate between the 4th 
and 5th grade classes. During this time, each teacher rotates the second hour and works with each 
group one hour per day.

These materials help students prepare for the upcoming  ELA State Test and the NYSESLAT  by 
focusing on reading comprehension, vocabulary, and test taking strategies. In addition, these 
materials also help prepare students for the Math State test by focusing on specific math 
standards, vocabulary, strategies, and skills. The work is differentiated for students as needed by 
the teachers to meet the instructional goals of our Title III program.

Begin description here:            
Rationale: 
Our teachers regularly attend professional development workshops and partake in learning cycles 
to better understand the unique learning needs of our ENL population.  These professional 
learning cycles are specifically chosen for our Title III teachers in order to focus on the 
program's objective, which is to prepare our students for the upcoming state tests and bridge the 
learning gap by improving their reading, writing, and math skills.  
 
Teachers to Receive Training: 
The teachers who are working the Title III After School Program are participating in these 
trainings. Ms. Otero, Ms. Delgado, and Mr. Tenaglia. 
 
Professional Development:  
At no cost to Title III,  our school works with coaches from Teachers College, Elise 
Whitehouse for grades kindergarten, 1st, & 2nd and Kara Arnold for grades 3, 4, & 5. They 
help our teachers with lesson differentiations in order to make the content accessible to 
all students, specifically our ENL population. Some of the topics include the use of  visuals, 
sentence frames, Total Physical Response, setting expectations with the use of modified rubrics, 
the use of graphic organizers, and modified texts. These meeting also include demo lessons and 
classroom Inter-visitations to share best practices. These Learning Cycles will take place twice a 
month running from September 2018 through March 2019. 
At no cost to Title III,  our school is also conducting a series of Math professional Learning 
Cycles facilitated by Doug Bynum from the National Training Network. He is helping our school 
implement strategies that can assist students in accessing the content material by providing an 
effective language learning environment. The topics discussed during the learning cycles include 
the use of contextual clues, providing differentiated materials, and integrated language learning 
in the content area. These learning cycles will be held from October 2018 through June 2019.  
 
At no cost to Title III, our ENL teachers Ms. Otero and Ms. Almanza participate in the District 8 
ELL PLC. This is a series of Professional Learning opportunities that focus on adapting units of 
study for English Language Learners. Ms. Almanza and Ms. Otero focus on strategies to provide

Part C: Professional Development  
access to complex, academic language as well as key ways to ensure comprehensible input for 
English Language Learners. Our ENL teachers share this information with the staff, during 
professional development time. Ms. Almanza and Ms. Otero also attended the Bronx Field 
Support Center ELL Symposium. Where they learned about the best ELL practices being 
implemented in other schools with in district 8.  

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

  how parents will be notified of these activities 

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
Rationale: 
At P.S. 36 we believe that a strong collaboration between parents and school is very important in 
the success of our students. We strive to keep parents well informed and share information that 
can help them and their children. We share strategies that can be used at home and set students 
expectations in order for parents to become aware of  their child's progress. We 
encourage parents to participate in our school community by offering parent engagement 
activities. Most importantly, we make a great effort to create a safe and welcoming 
environment for our parents and students.  
 
Parent Engagement Activities: 
At no cost to Title III, the Parent Coordinator, Norma Martinez and our ENL teachers, Ms. 
Almanza and Ms. Otero, will conduct the following workshops for our ELL parents:  
The Parent Orientation held in September 2018.  Subsequently, we plan a two 
session NYSESLAT workshop to discuss the upcoming NYSESLAT (New York State English 
as a Second Language Achievement Test) and how the Title III After School program can 
improve students' scores. The first session will be held on January 2019 and the second session 
will be held in March 2019. During the workshops, parents will be familiarized with how the test 
is scored and what the results mean in their child's language acquisition process. Parents will also 
get an opportunity to view the materials used in school to help prepare the students for the exam. 
Interpreters will be available in Spanish, Bengali, and Arabic to clarify information when 
necessary.  
 
Ms. Procario, the school librarian, will host a Fall Balanced Literacy Parent Workshop in 
October 2018 for Pre- Kindergarten and Kindergarten . During this time parents are given 
strategies to focus on how to support their children in reading and writing at home. Translation 
and Interpretation services are always available to parents as needed.  
 
How Parents are Notified of these Activities: 
Parents are notified and invited to workshops via flyers that are sent home, our school's website, 
and if needed, posters of the flyers are displayed in the lobby of the school's main entrance.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses the Early Childhood Literacy Assessment System (ECLAS-2) (grades k and 1), Fontas and Pinnell (grades k-2), 
and the Developmental Reading Assessments (DRA) (grades -3-5) as tools to assess the early literacy skills of our ELL 
students.  The Fundations Phonics program is also implemented as an early literacy curriculum throughout kindergarten, first 
grade, and second grade.  The assessments and data provided by Fundations are used to inform the teachers’ instructional 
plans.  The ENL teacher is familiar with the Fundations methodology and supports work done in the classroom during the ENL 
periods and regular conferences with classroom teachers to ensures a tailored instructional plan. 
The entire school implements pre- and post- assessments in math to monitor the progress of the students at the beginning, 
mid-way, and at the end of the school year. Also, at the end of each Go Math unit, a unit test is administered to assess what 
areas may still need to be targeted.  As a school, we implement Teachers College as a reading and writing curriculum, we use 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

TCRWP pre- and post- writing assessments to also monitor the growth of our students before and after each writing unit. 
These assessments help to guide our instruction and next steps to ensure the academic success of our students.    
The data provides insight into understanding how much ELL students are able to retain from previous years of instruction and 
monitor their progress through out he school year. This data gathered will help improve our school's instructional plan by 
targeting areas of instruction and we use the data from the NYSESLAT to focus on which modality ENL students need the most 
support with. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

All teachers at P.S. 36 have access to this data via their Skedula, iReady, and Google Drive accounts. Each account serves a 
different purpose to share Fountas and Pinnell, Eclass, DRA, and TCRWP levels, as well as teacher-created assessments and 
students’ ENL levels. This data is readily available and is updated as needed. Teachers meet during either common preps or 
during time that is allotted for planning to share information in order to differentiate lesson plans, to create targeted groups, 
and to implement an action plan for students who need additional support.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
An important indicator to the success of our ENL program is students' progression through each ENL level to ultimately 
become proficient in the English language. We also look at students' progress in their reading (Fountas and Pinnell, ECLAS, 
DRA, iReady, and TCRWP) and math levels. Our ENL teaches share NYSESLAT and NYSITELL scores. This data allows for teachers 
to identify and target the modalities that individual students need help with the most. After analyzing this year’s NYSESLAT 
scores, we found that students need additional support in writing. The majority of our students continue to make strides 
forward in the modalities of listening and speaking, as well as across content areas. Students in grades kindergarten through 
fifth, take pre and post exams before and after each unit of study in mathematics and writing. These exams allow teachers to 
identify areas of needs and support, as well as measure academic progress. These pre and post exams also assist teachers in 
monitoring the progress students make throughout the school year. We have identified that our ENL population requires 
additional math support, specifically word problems. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Students are grouped within their classrooms according to their reading and math levels gathered from the summative data. 
The grouping allows for the teachers to address the learning needs of each student while providing time for small group 
instruction. Title III after school support is offered to all current and former ELLs in grades three through five, providing 
support in both ELA and Math. Also, selected students in both first and second grade are invited to an academic after school 
providing support in reading and math. Students in these programs are strategically grouped and provided with small group 
instruction according to their reading and math levels. An ENL Math club is hosted by Ms. Almanza, ENL teacher, for ENL 
newcomer students in grades three through five. These students are exposed to math vocabulary and strategies as they 
prepare to take the New York State Math examine. Also, an ENL Art club for newcomer ELLs in grades one through five is 
hosted by the ENL teacher Ms. Otero and the art teacher Mr. Holt. During this time students are given the opportunities to 
express themselves artistically while they learn English with their peers in a comfortable environment. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our school follows the RtI model, which is based on three tiers of instruction and support. RtI provides a clear opportunity to 
see the progress individual students make throughout the school year. This data is accessible to  teachers during articulation 
periods. Through a speech initiative, our speech teachers push-in into first grade and kindergarten classrooms to provide at 
risk students Double Dose Fundations from Wilson within small group instruction. Recipe for Reading will be implemented as a 
progress monitored foundational phonics program targeting at risk students in grades three through five. Also, Four time a 
week for thirty minutes a week AIS works with targeted at risk students in comprehension, reading, writing and math 
instruction. We track progress to determine the effectiveness of the interventions using Fundations Progress Monitoring, 
Literacy benchmark assessments, and teacher conferencing notes.  The data gathered helps teachers identify areas of 
instruction that need to be targeted for ELLs as well as struggling monolingual students. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We use our students' NYSESLAT scores to help guide our ELL program in many ways. The ENL teachers look closely at individual 
modality scores for each ELL according to the information gathered from the ELL Data Analysis Tool and the RLAT from ATS. In 
order to identify the language acquisition needs of each ELL student, these tools help to determine students' various needs in 
the modalities of listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Based on this score analysis we are able to create targeted 
instruction that promotes the progress of the students' language needs.  We are also able to use this data and ENL levels to 
create small groups that are beneficial to all students. These data based pre-planned groups may consist of homogeneous 
and/or heterogeneous language proficiency levels depending on the desired outcome of lessons. 
Students' ENL levels, as determined by the NYSESLAT, also impact the amount of weekly mandated servicing minutes students 
are entitled to receive by CR Part 154. Our Entering and Emerging students are allotted 360 minutes of ENL services. These 
minutes are separated into Standalone ENL minutes and integrated content area ENL/ELA minutes. Transitioning students 
receive 180 minutes of integrated content area ENL/ELA and /or Standalone ENL. Expanding students receive 180 minutes of 
integrated content area ENL/ELA or other content areas such as math. Commanding ENL students receive 90 minutes of 
integrated content area ENL/ELA or other content areas such as math. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

All teachers at PS 36 have access to this data through their Google Drive accounts where can teachers can find all ELL students 
and their ENL levels. This data is readily available and is updated as needed. Teachers share this information in order to 
differentiate lesson plans, create targeted groups, and to implement an action plan for students who need additional support. 
Also, time is allotted in each teacher's schedule to co-plan with both the ENL teachers and other teachers on their grade level. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

             Our ENL students are served through an integrated model with Standalone ENL minutes. English is the 
language of instruction for the Freestanding ENL program. Our ENL program is staffed with trained and certified 
TESOL teachers; Ms. Almanza servicing grades 3-5, Ms. Otero servicing grades k-2, and Ms. Velez servicing a self 
contained second grade ENL classroom.  Both Ms. Almanza and Ms. Otero  provide integrated ENL units during 
content area instruction such as Math and ELA in the classroom, and provide Standalone ENL units of study in the ENL 
classroom.  ELL students are grouped according to grade level and/or using data from NYSESLAT scores. Students are 
grouped according to their English proficiency levels for Standalone units, and heterogeneously within regular 
classrooms during integrated units.  The ELLs on each grade level are placed in specified ELL classrooms in order to 
ensure ENL services are delivered.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

PS 36 ensures the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided to our ELL students based on their proficiency levels. 
Each student is programmed into the Stars Classroom system and assigned to a certified TESOL teacher.  Using students’ ENL 
levels, the mandated ENL minutes are designated to each teacher based on the integrated and standalone requirements. This 
enables P.S. 36 administration to confirm that all ELLs are receiving mandated instructional minutes based on CR Part 154. 
Entering students receive a total of 360 ENL minutes. This is divided into 180 Standalone ENL minutes and 180 integrated 
minutes in the ELA content area. Emerging students also receive a total of 360 ENL minutes. These minutes are divided into 90 
Standalone minutes, 180 integrated ELA/ENL minutes, and 90 minutes of flexibility between an integrated content area or 
standalone. Transitioning students receive a total of 180 minutes weekly. These minutes are divided into 90 ENL/ELA 
integrated services and minutes of either Standalone ENL or an integrated ENL content area based on scheduling. Expanding 
students receive 180 minutes of integrate ENL/ELA integrated content or another content area based on scheduling. We also 
continue to service our Commanding students for two years after scoring an English proficient level on the NYSESLAT or score 
Expanding on the NYSESLAT in combination with a 3 on the New York State ELA examine. These students receive 90 minutes 
per week of  integrated ENL in a content area with flexibility based on scheduling. 
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
English as a New Language is taught through an integrated curriculum that includes reading, writing, listening, and speaking. 
Ongoing articulation between our ENL teachers and classroom teachers ensures that integrated content-based ENL instruction 
is complimentary to what students are learning in their mainstream classrooms.  Our ENL teachers are required to deliver 
academically rigorous lessons that are aligned to the New Language Arts Proficiency (NLAP) standards, using the Point of Entry 
Model.  Teachers maintain evidence of teacher conferences, informal assessments, and progress of students’ work. Flexible 
grouping and cooperative learning engages students in communicative, cognitive, and metacognitive activities.  All ELL 
instruction at P.S. 36 is conducted in English. The instructional approaches incorporate language experiences, Point of Entry 
Model, Total Physical Response (TPR), and the use of technology and the arts.  The scaffolding methods used to make content 
comprehensive includes modeling, bridging, accessing prior knowledge, collaborative work, text representation, 
contextualization, schema building, and meta-cognitive development.  The school wide (k-5) math curriculum used is GoMath, 
which is Common Core aligned, incorporates an ELL component, and has math manipulatives for hands on learning.  Teachers 
College is used school wide as our ELA curriculum for reading and writing in grades kindergarten through fifth. This is a CCLS 
aligned curriculum that promotes the academic success of students.  Our science curriculum follows the Foss Science 
Curriculum, which provides hands-on learning experiences for our students.  Social Studies classes implement the Passport to 
Social Studies curriculum which follows the New York State Social Studies Framework and the New York State scope and 
sequence, which is CCLS aligned. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

The Spanish Lab is administered to our newcomer students who speak Spanish. The data gathered from the Spanish Lab 
determines how literate students are in Spanish. All parents of newcomer ENL students entering our school who speak a 
language other than Spanish are interviewed, with the help of an interpreter, to learn of the students’ prior schooling history 
and literacy proficiency in their home language. We try to support non-English speakers as much as we can by providing 
translated materials, Spanish math workbooks, and bilingual glossaries for ELA, Math, Social Studies, and Science.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

We differentiate instruction by using scaffolding strategies, flexible grouping, and collaborative work.  In addition, we analyze 
the results of the NYSESLAT and the ELL interim assessment to further differentiate instruction to meet the students’ language 
needs. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

  
a. SIFE 
        SIFE students are included in after school tutoring programs. These students are also placed in small groups for 
differentiated instruction and targeted support. Parents of SIFE students are invited to take part in various parent workshops. 
These students also are invited to attend after school tutoring sessions and the summer enrichment program (third through 
fifth grade) with Title III funds in math, science, and ELA. 
  
b. Newcomer 
         For newcomer students we provide extended small group instruction and interventions that target their language 
development.  Stand-alone ENL mandated minutes allows for the ENL teachers to target specific language strategies that help 
these students build their vocabulary and English grammar skills. These students also are invited to attend after school 
tutoring sessions and the summer enrichment program (third through fifth grade) with Title III funds in math, science, and ELA. 
  
c. Developing 
        Developing ELL students have access to the full range of interventions available at our school.  They are placed in small 
groups for tutoring and guided reading, both within their classrooms and in the ENL classroom. These students also are invited 
to attend after school tutoring sessions and the summer enrichment program (third through fifth grade) with Title III funds in 
math, science, and ELA. 
  
d. Long Term 
        Long Term ELLs are placed in after school tutoring sessions and are considered for the full range of AIS supports in the 
content areas.  These students are also invited to attend after school tutoring session and the summer enrichment program 
(third through fifth grade) with Title III fund in math, science, and ELA.  
  
e. Former ELLs up to 2 years after exiting status 
        As per the new mandates of CR Part 154, our school will be servicing former ELL students who have tested commanding 
on the NYSESLAT for two years after they have received this score.  These students are serviced through integrated ENL 
instruction in ELA and/or content areas based on scheduling. Their instruction is delivered by one of our ENL teachers through 
push-in instruction.  They are also placed in small groups for differentiated instruction and targeted support. Former ELL 
students are also invited to attend after school tutoring sessions and the summer enrichment program (third through fifth 
grade) with Title III funds in math, science, and ELA. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
            To meet the diverse needs of ELLs-SWDs ENL teachers collaborate with both Special Education teachers and classroom 
teachers to modify lessons and grade-level materials to make content comprehensible for these students. Students are 
provided with modified text or text in their native language, as well as visuals and readily available technology (ipads, 
chromebooks, etc,.) to support students as best as possible. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELLs students who receive Special Education services are provided with the full range of interventions available at the 
school.  They are placed in small groups for tutoring and guided reading within their classroom. These students also attend the 
after school program with Title III funds in math and ELA, and are invited to 
the Title III summer enrichment program.  Students receive ELA interventions with Wilsons Double Dose Fundations, small 
group instruction, and RtI interventions. Students receive math interventions with small group instruction focusing on using 
manipulatives and visual to increase comprehension skills.  The Science and Social Studies teachers works closely with the ELLs-
SWDs to ensure content knowledge. Teachers are encouraged to assist the ELLs-SWDs by using the glossary of terms in their 
native language.  The content instruction is in English with native language support when available. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Students receive ELA interventions through our Response to Intervention programs such as Great Leaps, Wilson’s Double Dose 
Fundations, and small group instructions.  Students receive math interventions with small group instructions focusing on using 
manipulatives and visuals to increase comprehension skills. The Science and Social Studies teachers work closely with the ELLs 
to ensure content knowledge. Teachers are encouraged to assist the ELLs with using glossaries in their native languages. The 
content instruction is in English with native language support when available. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    
 The following improvements are being implemented for the school year: Our teachers are involved in continuing to 
strengthen teacher practice in the areas of engagement questioning and assessment in order to support student learning. Our 
RtI team is refining systems for each if the Tiers I, II, and III.  This supports our English Language Learners in receiving the 
proper interventions to meet their academic needs. Programs such as Recipe for Reading will be included in our RtI plan to 
support ELLs and struggling readers. Improvements also will include revising schedules providing RtI periods across grades. 
Units of study and performance tasks help to align instruction to meet our English Language Learners’ academic needs. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 
There are no programs being discontinued that support our ELLs. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our ENL students are very active participants in all schools activities, which include Chorus, AIS, after school, Saturday 
Academy, Boy Scouts, the Nutrition Committee, and Recycling Committee/ Green Team.  They also participate in after school 
programs, such as Academic Intervention and an eight-teen week Title III Academic After School program.  Out Title III funds 
are also used to address the needs of our newcomers. Starting in January they will be invited to attend the Saturday 
Academy.  The ENL teachers invite and encourages the ELL students to participate in all school activities. They also deliver and 
clarify information about the different activities and programs being held to the students themselves and their parents. The 
goals of our after school activities is to provide students with many experiences and unique educational opportunities. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
  At P.S. 36 there are a variety of materials to support our English Language Learners at all levels. Teachers integrate 
technology and audiovisual materials into their lessons in order to tie visual meaning to words. Classrooms have listening 
centers with audio books and computer centers with laptops and IPads that are used regularly throughout the school year. 
These centers benefit all ELL sub groups from Entering to Commanding students as they listen and follow along with stories 
and engage in vocabulary and English grammar building activities using the available technology. 
 
We are also very fortunate to have a leveled library in the ENL lab that includes bilingual books in Spanish, Bengali, Arabic, 
Punjabi, French, Albanian, and Urdu. We also maintain a bilingual section in our school’s library that is accessible to both 
parents and students on a daily basis.   
To help support Entering ELL students in grades three through five, we provide them with bilingual content vocabulary 
glossaries such as math, science, and social studies in their home languages. These glossaries are obtained from the NYC DOE. 
The school also supports Entering, Emergent, and other ELL sub groups as needed with Go Math translated assessments, 
textbooks, materials, and manipulatives in the classrooms. These material help students make connections between the 
concepts being taught and creating literal meaning. During the ELA block, Entering and Emerging students are given modified 
texts and writing supports such as visuals and sentence starters to support grade appropriate learning. Transitioning and 
Expanding students are also given writing scaffolds as they continue to acquire the English language. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

     Students arriving new to the country are placed in small groups for ENL instruction. They take part in extra tutoring sessions 
to develop the basic communication skills that other beginner students may have already acquired.  The native language

speakers of Spanish are usually placed in a monolingual setting with a teacher who speaks Spanish. These students also receive 
Spanish support in the content areas with their classroom teacher and ENL teachers, who also speak Spanish, the parents of 
newcomers are also invited to the ENL workshops to help better support their children.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

       All required support services and resources correspond to the students’ grade level, age, and NYSESLAT data.  All our ENL 
groups are formed by grade level. All instruction is geared towards students’ appropriate ages.  The students are grouped 
according to their NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores, which newly include entering, emerging, transitional, expanding, and 
commanding. Instruction is modified and/or scaffolded to meet students’ needs. Students are also supported through small 
group instruction to help reach grade appropriate levels in listening, speaking, reading, and writing.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
      N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
     If the school becomes aware of newly enrolled ELL students by June or July, they are invited to attend the Title III ELL 
summer enrichment program.  This provides good preparation for the upcoming school year. During the school year, ELLs in 
grade 3, 4, and 5 are invited to attend the Title III after school program, and Saturday Academy.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

There are no language electives offered at P.S. 36.  Native language support is offered to meet the language needs of the 
newcomer students who are mandated to take the content area tests.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We do not have a dual language program at P.S. 36.     
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The ENL staff at P.S. 36 are active participants in ENL professional development. Our teachers, paraprofessionals, psychologist, 
occupational/physical therapists, speech therapists, parent coordinator, and administrators regularly attend professional 
development as offered by the ENL staff here and the DOE.  An ENL teacher library resource was established in the schools UFT 
Teachers’ Center.  Our classroom and ENL teachers who attend professional development outside of the school, discuss the 
session during grade conferences and during professional development extended hours. In addition, our ENL teachers, Ms. 
Almanza and Ms. Otero, present and disseminate different techniques and resources on how to provide support for the ELL 
students. As part of a TC reading and writing project school, both Ms. Otero and Ms. Almanza will be participating in a two day 
session at Teachers College titled Adapting Units of Study for English Language Learners on October 2nd and 3rd. They will turn 
key the information and useful writing strategies learned for the staff on Monday December 4th and Monday December 11th 
2017 in the library. Our non-pedagogic staff are also invited to attend all in-house professional learnings, which include 
Paraprofessionals, secretaries, and other support staff. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

 
Ms. Almanza and Ms. Otero will also be hosting a staff, both pedagogue and non-pedagogue, workshop on the ELL 
identification process. This will ensure all teachers and staff are aware of how English Language Learners are identified in the 
NYC public schools, what the NYISTELL looks like on each grade level, and how the parents are notified of the child’s ELL status. 
This workshop will take place on Monday November 6, 2017. 
 
Our teachers are often involved in various professional development workshops that address the needs of the ELLs as they 
engage in the Common Core Learning Standards. Teaching literacy and supporting English language acquisition is no longer the 
sole concern of the ENL teachers, but is a collaborative effort among all staff. We give our teachers the opportunity to attend 
workshops and other professional development that support learning strategies for ENL either in house or offered by the 
Division of English Language Learners & Student support. These workshops include Math Examplars that deliver ELL strategies 
for grades k through 5, ways of supporting ELLs with the new Teacher’s College curriculum, and support teachers by sharing 
strategies for Newcomers, Entering, and Entering ELLs. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Professional development is offered based on observation feedback, teacher reflections, student needs and district-wide 
initiatives. Included in this are workshops on writing offered by Teacher's College conference days, mini-institutes and 
coaching, District 8, and the Borough Field Support Center that are some ELL specific. 
Principal regularly sends teachers to external professional development to strengthen their practice. Provides time for 
reflection and sharing of learned best practices. For example, as part of a TC reading and writing project school, both Ms. 
Otero and Ms. Almanza will be participating in a two day session at Teachers College titled Adapting Units of Study for English 
Language Learners on October 2nd and 3rd. They will turn key the information and useful writing strategies learned from the 
workshop. Our non-pedagogic staff are also invited to attend all in-house professional learnings as well, which include 
Paraprofessionals, secretaries, and other support staff. We also have structures in place to provide common planning time 
such as the use of common preps, Monday collaborative planning, and monthly Vertical Team Meetings to help Implement 
Instructional rounds to inform professional learning needs and provide next steps for improving teacher practice. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our school formally meets with parents four times a year. These meeting occur during Meet the Teacher Night in September 
and Parent Teacher Conferences in November, March and, May. In addition to these meeting parents are always welcome to 
meet with teachers on Tuesdays from 2:40pm to 3:20pm. Our attendance office and guidance counselor, Ms. Perez, 
communicate with parents on a daily basis, as needed, to inform parent about their child's status. The ENL teachers also 
meet with parents individually throughout the year. Parents and staff members are aware that they can request over-the-
phone interpretation services for outgoing calls to parents and to communicate during face-to-face meetings. Interpreters are 
always provided for IEP meeting or when requested by the parent.   

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Fortunately, at P.S. 36 there is a tradition of involved parents. In September, we have Meet the Teacher Night which provides 
all parents, including our ELL parents, the opportunity to meet their respective teachers and become familiar with expectations 
and procedures. This is a well attended event. In order to accommodate our ELL parents we provide native language 
interpretation and translation. In addition to these meetings, parents are always welcome to meet with teachers on Tuesdays 
from 2:40pm to 3:20pm. Our teachers also host a variety of parent workshop that inform parents on ways they can help their

children at home with Math, reading, and writing strategies. Twice a year we host Family Literacy Nights and parents get the 
opportunity to work with their children in literacy activities by collaborating with teachers. These nights are facilitated by 
school staff, including ENL teachers. In the spring there is the Math Carnival. This event includes many fun math games and 
activities in a carnival setting. The children, including ELLs and their parents look forward to this event every year.  Our school 
also offers ESL classes to limited-English Proficient parents on Tuesday afternoons and Friday mornings. Ms. Dedaj helps 
parents learn basic interpersonal communication skills and helps parents acquire basic reading and writing skills. 
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
The ENL and Arts department began an extended day program on Tuesday afternoons. This program is directed for Newcomer ELLs 
and gives the students an opportunity to learn English through the arts. Students are invited to enriching field trips and language 
experiences.  We also offer entering ENL students in grades three, four, and five the opportunity to join a Math Club which serves 
as additional support in preparation for the New York Math State Test.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Elvira Maresca, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The Language Access Coordinator, Ms. Almanza, as well as the ENL teacher, Ms. Otero, track the language 
preferences of all parents in the school community. Written and oral language preference data is collected using 
by our pupil accountant, Ms. Barrett and entered into ATS. We use Student Registration Forms which are 
completed by the enrollment office and parents. Also, we use the data from the Home Language Identification 
Survey (HLIS) that is completed by all parents during initial enrollment and Emergency Contact Cards /Blue Cards 
that are completed by all parents at the beginning of every school year or upon enrollment in a new school. All 
this data is collected to determine parents’ language preference and throughout the year, the Language Access 
Coordinator regularly generates and reviews up-to-date ATS reports which indicate preferred languages for 
parents in our school community.

information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

In accordance with the Chancellor's Regulations, our program provides parents with the knowledge that translation 
and interpretation services are available through the Parent Newsletters such as "Helping to involve Parents school 
Internet accessibility," "School Handbook," and "Parent Handbook." Our language access ensures that parents have 
access to the "What Do NYC Parents Speak?" brochures and we also have welcome posters at the entrance of the 
school informing parents that translation and interpretation services are available as per their request.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

At the end of every parent meeting or workshop we provide parents with a feedback form in which they rate the 
event and add suggestions to better our practices. Parents also receive an annual survey when they attend the Parent 
Teacher Conferences in March. This survey allows parents to rate how satisfied they are with the services provided by 
the school.
