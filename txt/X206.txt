Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

School Mission: We are a standards-driven learning community, which partners with all stakeholders to foster a 
safe and respectful learning environment. We inspire excellence and empower all students to take responsibility 
for their learning and prodigiously apply the acquired knowledge and skills necessary for college and career 
readiness and personal success. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

School Vision: 206B: A place where all students are inspired to be lifelong learners in the 21st century and feel safe 
taking academic risks, delving deeper into learning, collaborating, and being responsible and productive citizens  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

IS 206B is dedicated to providing a rigorous, risk-free learning environment inclusive of all students. Every lesson 
begins with a learning target and consists of targeted explicit instruction and modeling by the teacher. Students are 
encouraged to work cooperatively to problem solve, and work is differentiated based on formative assessment data. 
Learning activities are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards, and classroom instruction is rigorous and 
encourages student engagement. Students write data-driven goals and reflect on outcomes as part of the interim 
report that is provided to parents and students in each core subject. Teachers provide meaningful feedback and 
actionable next-steps on a regular basis. 

 

In order to address the needs of our growing population of English as a New Language (ENL) students, the staff has 
been trained in the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) Model, which is a research-based instructional 
model that is effective in addressing the academic needs of ENLs. the school is a member of the Learning Partners 
Program whereby staff and administrators partner with two other schools using an inquiry-based model on promising 
practices to increase student academic achievement. Moreover, the staff is familiar with a variety of strategies to 
scaffold instruction, including the adaptation of content, links to past learning, modeling, guided practice, multiple 
forms of grouping, hands on activities, and we monitor progress via the IReady computerized reading program, in 
house interim exams, and other forms of assessments. In the 2018-2019 academic year, we will continue working on 
supporting the professional development of staff in the aforementioned initiatives.  

 

IS 206B has adopted the Code X materials for English Language Arts (ELA) and the CMP3 materials for math through 
the DOE curriculum materials option. As such, we are able to use the formative assessment materials provided in the 
adopted texts to differentiate instruction, group students, and provide data-drive feedback and next steps. Teachers 
monitor student progress by assessing students regularly and tracking outcomes. Additionally, teachers have the 
option to supplement materials and resources to fit the needs of ENLs, Students with Disabilities (SWDs), Tier 2, Tier 
3, and enrichment students. 

 

Grade level inquiry teacher teams meet every two weeks to discuss at-risk and struggling students in order to 
collaborate on teaching the whole child. Content teachers also meet every two weeks to analyze student data to 
inform instruction and modify curriculum to meet the needs of students who do not meet the standards. Staff 
members who provide additional social, emotional, and academic supports such as guidance counselors, speech, 
English as a New Language (ENL), and Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS) providers work closely with 
teacher teams to provide scaffolds and modifications to support classroom instruction. 

For the 2018- 2019 academic year, IS 206B will continue our successful partnership with the Middle School Quality 
Initiative (MSQI) whose literacy framework is based on the Reading Next research describing both the instructional 
and structural necessities for the improvement of adolescent literacy. Through this partnership, we intend to continue 
to strengthen literacy practices and better prepare grade-level readers at IS 206B. We will be administering the 
Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) assessment three times a year help us identify struggling readers and provide 
strategic interventions and enrichment opportunities. MSQI will support teachers through tiered professional 
development in data-driven instruction, developing and strengthening reading comprehension and writing strategies 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

in all content areas, and building content and academic vocabulary through Word Generation, a research-based 
vocabulary acquisition program based on current events. Additionally, we will be implementing a daily strategic 
reading period for all students, based on their individual needs. Teachers will provide customized, small group 
instruction based on students' individual needs as a reader. This time will serve both as intervention for struggling 
readers and acceleration for readers who are approaching or above grade level. 

 

This year, IS 206B implemented Mathletics, an online math learning platform, which provides students with Common 
Core Learning Standard aligned individualized instruction that supports student driven learning and teacher led 
instruction. Students worked on their Mathletics work once a week in school and were encouraged to continue 
instruction at home. Teachers used data collected from Mathletics to create differentiated groups and provide 
targeted small group instruction in math skills. Next year, Mathletics computer time will be embedded into student 
schedules two to three times a week. 

 

IS 206B prides itself on communicating high expectations to all school constituents. The staff handbook provides 
clarity of expectations across a number of areas including administrative matters, attendance for staff and students, 
professionalism, school safety and security, student discipline and guidance, and teaching and learning. Information is 
disseminated to staff through faculty conferences, observation feedback, and a weekly Looking Ahead newsletter that 
communicates activities for the week. In order to prepare our students for college and career readiness, the school 
community provides guidance in setting student SMART goals, utilizing student goal sheets and interim reports, 
conducting grade level student expectation meetings, and participating in PBIS and College and Career Readiness 
programs. Parents expectations and student progress are communicated through parent meetings facilitated by the 
parent coordinator and school staff, monthly school notes, student goal sheets and interim reports of progress, 
Engrade, an online grading system, blast phone calls, texts, and face-to-face meetings. The staff plays a leadership 
role in the setting of high expectations for each other, for students, and for parents by communicating with parents in 
writing throughout the school year, setting agendas for team meetings, communicating expectations on a daily basis 
to students through their lessons, and by communicating with parents by phone and the use of notices of concern and 
behavior referrals. 

 

In order to develop effective school leadership, we have significantly increased opportunities for teachers to share 
best practices, learn from each other, and take on leadership roles. Teachers facilitate teams and school-wide 
meetings, provide support in differentiated instruction and scaffolding, coach numerous sports teams and after-
school clubs, lead inquiry and student support teams, run the PBIS and Safe Schools programs, and reach out to 
parents and the community through school-wide initiatives such as College Day, Career Day, and Family Fun 
Education Nights. Teachers will also be collaborating with educators from a neighboring middle school to share best-
practices and create comprehensive unit plans in all content areas. 

 

Professional Growth: 

  Content specific teams meet every other Monday for roughly 40 minutes to revise and roll-out the curriculum 

in ELA and math. Science and social studies teacher meet as a part of the ELA department in order to ensure 
the successful implementation of reading and writing skills and strategies throughout all content areas. 
During the meetings, teachers also collect and analyze student data from formative and summative 
assessments in order to drive instruction and differentiate learning. Teacher teams discuss best practices and 
research driven resources to support student academic growth.

 

Four inquiry teams meet every other Tuesday for roughly 30 minutes following a protocol for examining 
student work. During each meeting, one teacher on each team presents students work which is examined by 
the group for employment of instructional shifts, rigor, student understanding and next steps, and possible 
adjustment to instruction or curriculum maps. 

  Teacher teams meet every other Tuesday in grade level groupings for student academic and social-emotional 

support. These teams meet in a child study format and systematically analyze and discuss strategies to 
employ across all teachers working with the student in order to improve academics or social-emotional 
adjustment. 

  During the 2017-2018 academic year, all staff members participated in ten session of professional 

development with the Fordham University Center for Educational Partnerships at IS 206B around best 
practices in differentiation, targeted instruction, and student engagement strategies and giving effective 
feedback and promoting self-assessment utilizing formative assessments. Select teachers were also coached 
in the classroom for seven sessions in order to ensure successful implementation of strategies. We hope to 
continue this partnership during the 2018-2019 academic year. 

  During the 2018-2019 academic year, we will continue partnering with the Middle School Quality Initiative 
(MSQI) to continue strengthen literacy practices in all content areas and better prepare grade-level readers 
and writers. MSQI consultants will support teachers in and out of the classroom through tiered professional 
development in data-driven instruction, developing and strengthening reading comprehension and writing 
strategies in all content areas, supporting individualized reading development through reciprocal teaching, 
conferring, Socratic seminars, and debate, and building content and academic vocabulary using the Word 
Generation program. 

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We currently have 206 students enrolled at IS 206B. 34% of our student population are ENLs and 34% are SWDs. 

In order to meet the needs of our ENL population, integrated and standalone components of the freestanding / pull-
out ENL program are provided by a certified ENL / ELA teacher. As a large portion of our ENL students fall between the 
entering proficiency levels, as reflected by the most recent NYSESLAT and NYSITELL test scores, a bridge bilingual class 
will be formed in order to meet the needs of these students. During the 2017-2018 academic year, an F-status 
bilingual education teacher was hired to work with the ENLs three days a week on math skills. Additionally, instruction 
is differentiated and scaffolded for all ENLs according to their proficiency levels and individual needs, and all teachers 
use the SIOP model when planning lessons. During the 2017 - 2018 academic year, we implemented iLit, a research-
driven online literacy intervention program in order to provide additional targeted, personalized instruction. Extended 
after-school and Saturday school programs provide ours ENLs with opportunities to continue their English language 
development. ENLs with special needs receive the same opportunities to participate in the same instructional 
programs available to all of our ENLs.  

In order to meet the needs of our SWD population, classroom teachers collaborate with guidance counselors, the 
speech teacher, IEP teacher, and SETSS teacher in order to modify instruction and scaffold learning. Special Education 
teachers meet regularly to discuss strategies that can support SWD academic, social, and emotional growth. The 
implementation of PBIS has been proven successful with our SWD population. Consistent, positive reinforcement has 
resulted in a significant decrease in behavioral infractions and disruptions to learning. Additionally, supplemental 
resources and scaffolds have been incorporated into the curriculum in math and ELA. The Collin Writing process helps 
teachers pinpoint challenges in writing. In the 2018- 2019 all students will be assessed in math using the TOMA3 and 
DRP in ELA in order to better target strengths and deficiencies. Those students who score significantly below grade 
level on the DRP assessment will be tested using a secondary diagnostics. Results will determine whether students will 
need either WILSON phonics intervention or STARI comprehension intervention during their strategic reading periods.

 

Strong Family-Community Ties: IS 206B has been working diligently to create strong family-community ties by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families and community-based organizations. 
According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Survey, 95% of constituents view parent outreach positively, while 
90% of constituents view parent involvement in school positively. IS 206B’s parents / guardians are 
encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent 
Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. Throughout the year, IS 
206B supports parents by providing materials and teacher-led workshops to help parents work with their 
children to achieve academic success. Teachers and staff members regularly reach out to parents / guardians 
using various forms of communication including face-to-face meetings, email, and blast phone calls which has 
fostered a caring and effective home-school partnership. Additionally, IS 206B families have been invited to 
school events throughout the year such as the Winter Classical Music Concert, Blue Man Group Outing, Family 
Movie Night, Math / ELA/ Science Family Fun Night, and a monthly family breakfast celebrating high-achieving 
student leaders. In May, our teacher-led committee reached out to community members and organized our 
second annual IS 206B Career Day. During this half-day celebration, students and parents learned about 
different professions and heard key-note addresses of encouragement from three local community members. 
  Trust: We have also focused on increasing trust between all stakeholders. Everyone in the IS 206B community 

works toward the shared goals of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school and 
beyond. According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Survey, 98% of parents/guardians agree that teachers and 
parents/guardians think of each other as partners in educating children. 98% of parents/ guardians agree that 
they feel respected by their child's principal/ school leader, 85% of students agree that their teachers treat 
them with respect, and 94% of the teachers agree that they feel respected by administration. In order to 
achieve these significant gains in trust, we focused on strengthening communication between all constituents. 
Administration consistently provides actionable feedback to teachers, focusing on Danielson's Framework 
Components 3B (Using questioning and discussion techniques) and 3C (Engaging Students in Learning). 
Teachers work collaboratively to meet the academic, social, and emotional needs of students. Teachers keep 
parents and students informed of progress via conferences, emails, texts, and phone conversations.  

Framework for Great Schools Focus Areas (2018 - 2019):  

  Rigorous Instruction: In the coming year, we plan to continue focusing on building rigorous instruction at IS 

206B. During the 2017-2018 academic year, staff members participated in ten sessions of professional 
development with the Fordham University Center for Educational Partnerships focused around 
differentiation, targeted instruction, and student engagement strategies and giving effective feedback and 
promoting self-assessment utilizing formative assessment We will continue supporting teachers in the 
classroom through peer coaching and inter-visitations with the ultimate goal of increasing rigor and engaging 
all students in learning. With this goal in mind, we have partnered with Learning Partners Program (LPP) to 
strengthen our assessment practices. Progress monitoring and using formative data in LPP teams directly 
correlates to our academic focus area of rigorous instruction. Additionally, we will continue to stretch student 
thinking through debate and discussions, and deepen teachers' skills in the use of formative assessment 
practices as well as student self-assessment to drive instruction. 

  Collaborative Teachers: We will continue to build upon the collaborative environment we pride ourselves on 

at IS 206B. In the coming year, we will focus on increasing cultural awareness during instruction and 
differentiating learning activities in order to create an inclusive classroom environment. Teachers will 
continue to study the whole child through Inquiry team meetings and work together to make lessons relevant 
to student experiences. Additionally, we plan on providing staff members to visit neighboring schools to share 
best practices and learn from each other.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
I.S. 206B ensures engaging, rigorous, and coherent curriculum in all subjects as indicated by a rating of proficient in 
indicator 1.1 (Curriculum) of the 2016-2017 Quality Review. Additionally, indicator 1.2 (Pedagogy) shifted from an 
area of focus (developing) to an area of celebration (proficient). Finally, indicator 2.2 (Assessment) was also identified 
as an area of celebration. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, IS 206B continues to improve Mathematics 
instruction from last year's progress and in addition, focuses further attention on literacy for the 2018-2019 school 
year. With a student population of about 26% English Language Learners and 37% with Individualized Education Plans, 
rigorous instruction at IS 206B involves providing the necessary supports and scaffolds to allow all students to achieve 
mastery. In Mathematics, the model teacher will support the math department in deconstructing the Danielson 
Framework 3C Engaging Students in Learning as well as providing modeling, coaching, and technical assistance on 
specific instructional strategies. IS 206B will also partner with MSQI to support students in confidently showcasing 
their learning and demonstrate mastery of standards through high quality educational experiences. With an emphasis 
on writing, student achievement towards mastery will be monitored through pre-assessment and post-assessments, 
such as the Degrees of Power (DRP) assessment, in order to both challenge students and assess how to support 
academic need towards success. 

According to the 2017-2018 NYS School Quality Survey, on average, 82% of teachers believe instruction reflects the 
instructional shifts in ELA and math. IS 206B has adopted the Code X materials for English Language Arts (ELA) and the 
CMP3 curriculum for mathematics. As such, we are able to use the formative assessment materials provided in the 
adopted texts to differentiate instruction, group students, and provide data-drive feedback and next steps. Teachers 
monitor student progress by assessing students regularly and tracking outcomes. Additionally, teachers have the 
option to supplement materials and resources to fit the needs of ENLs, Students with Disabilities (SWDs), Tier 2, Tier 
3, and enrichment students. For the 2018 - 2019, students will also be using 1-Ready, a research-based online 
program that assesses students throughout the year and provides targeted, personalized instruction in both ELA and 
math. 

Lesson plans across grades and content areas show evidence of planned academic tasks and multiple entry points for 
ENLs and SWDs. Teachers plan questions using Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK). In order to address the needs of 
our growing population of English as a New Language (ENL) students, the staff has been trained in the Sheltered 
Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) Model, which is a research-based instructional tool that is effective in helping 
teachers better address the academic needs of ENLs.  

Students are aware of the instructional objectives and write goals addressing these on the front end of each marking 
period. According to the 2017-2018 NYC School Quality Survery, 89% (8% increase from the previous year) of students 
viewed course clarity positively. A reflection on the objectives and goals is a part of the interim reporting that is done 
to parents and students in each core subject. This same clarity is addressed at the start of each lesson. Students are 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15 

 

aware of the assessment criteria and of the content and language objective for each lesson at the start. Learning 
activities are aligned to the objective and assessment for understanding takes place throughout the lesson for the 
purpose of adjusting instruction. Additionally, rubrics and focus correction areas are introduced at the beginning of 
units to guide students during tasks. 

The 2017 test data reveals that 16% of students scored proficient on the ELA state exam. Given that the 
aforementioned falls below the city average, in 2018-2019 I.S. 206 will continue to collaborate with MSQI placing an 
emphasis on promising literacy practices in order to support students' abilities to demonstrate growth in this area. 
We will also continue to use classroom observations to provide teachers with actionable feedback to support student 
achievement. Our participation in the Learning Partners Program (LPP) will also afford us an opportunity to participate 
in peer inter-visitations and intra-visitations with neighboring schools in support of our ELA initiatives. Additionally, 
we will continue supporting the strengthening of teacher pedagogy in questioning, collaborative grouping, student 
discussion, student choice, and classroom engagement.  

The 2017 - 2018 NYS School Quality Survey indicates that 77% (16% increase since previous year) of students feel the 
work in the classroom is challenging. We will continue to increase the rigor in the classroom and provide students 
with multiple entry points by differentiating instruction, providing enrichment opportunities after school, adding 
debate into the social studies curriculum and after school, and incorporating reciprocal teaching and Socratic 
seminars in all content classrooms.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all students at IS 206B, including English Language Learners (ELLs) and Students with Disabilities (SWDs) 
will demonstrate a 10% increase in ELA proficiency as measured by NYS assessments.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

The 2016-2017 Quality Review Report, dated January 6, 2017, found indicator 1.4 (Learning Environment) to be an 
area of celebration for the school with a rating of proficient. The indication is that the school's approach to cultural 
building, discipline, and social-emotional support results in a safe and inclusive learning environment. Structures are 
in place, such as the Good Shepherd program, to ensure that each student is known well by at least one adult. 
According to the 2017-2018 NYC School Quality Survey, 87% of constituents feel the school is a safe learning 
environment. 

IS 206B continues to partner with Good Shepherd Services to give all students an opportunity to participate in an 
extended school day. Good Shepherd’s staff along with our science teachers have undertaken STEM training at the 
New York Hall of Science. They work together during the school day and the after school program to implement and 
align activities in each setting. Art/ music teachers are scheduled into the regular school day as well as the after 
school program on a rotating basis that varies by semester. Additionally, parents and students are referred for 
counseling and support at Good Shepherd Counseling Center located within the school’s neighborhood. 

IS 206B is in its fifth year of implementing a Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) program. The PBIS 
committee meets monthly to refine the program while looking at student data regarding behavioral issues. As a 
result, we have created a PBIS-influenced "Respectful and Responsible Matrix" defining behavioral expectations in 
common areas of the school. During class checks, teachers remind students of expectations and model positive 
behavior. Students are rewarded through PBIS trips, ice cream socials, and dances. For the fifth year of 
implementation, PBIS members will create a calendar for parents, students, and staff with incentives and trips 
planned for the 2018-2019 academic year.  

During the 2018 - 2019 school year, IS 206B will be implementing the Brain Power Wellness program in grades 6-8 
with support from the Social Emotional Wellness Alliance LLC. Brain Power Wellness teaches physical and mental 
brain breaks, mindfulness practices, and social emotional wellness strategies that support a positive classroom 
atmosphere. Teacher leaders have been trained in the program and will receive support throughout the year through 
Brain Power. This research-based program will help us create a sustainable, healthy, happy and focused school 
environment conducive to learning and academic growth. 

The school's Online Occurrence Reporting System (OORS) data reports show an increase of 8 reported incidents 
during the 2017-2018 academic year, which is still 73% lower than what was reported two years ago. We will continue 
to work on establishing a common vision that provides a safe school environment and addresses social and emotional 
issues that are significantly impacting our students. This should be a shared vision that should be able to be 
articulated by staff, students and parents. Further, this should include the use of data to track the efficacy of 
strategies employed to improve the school’s culture and the ability to provide for the social emotional needs of 
students. This year, we partnered with Engaging School: Safe Public Spaces around implementing strategic changes in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19 

 

policies, systems, and practices that align with our school's goals for discipline and student support. Engaging Schools 
aims to foster a school-wide discipline and student support model that is fair, respectful, restorative, accountable, and 
viable. Next year, we will continue partnering with Engaging Schools on creating engaging classrooms that foster 
academic, social, and emotional learning and development in all students, and establishes optimal conditions for 
learning. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, IS 206B will successfully implement the Brain Power Wellness Program which will be focused around 
deepening the understanding of social emotional development and supporting our diverse student population as 
evidenced by a 10% reduction in student behavioral infractions on the OORS progress report.

Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 
Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
Human resources are needed for the planning and executing of the PBIS Program and for the teaching teams 
organized for student support. The initial PBIS improvement meeting will be done with per session funding provided 
by Tax Levy Funds. Following that PBIS planning and the Student Support Groups will meet during contractual time on 
Tuesday afternoons. There is some funding needed for the PBIS Program activities, although we will try to keep this as 
budget neutral as possible by looking for activities with low cost and high interest for students. There is some 
schedule adjustment necessary for the activities as the activities are scheduled for only those students who meet the 
criteria by exhibiting behaviors on the matrix.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The 2016-2017 Quality Review Report, dated January 6, 2017, found indicator 1.1 (Curriculum) to be an area of 
celebration for the school with a rating of proficient. The indication is that the school ensures engaging, rigorous, and 
coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners and aligned to CCLS and/or content standards. 
Additionally, indicator 1.2 (Pedagogy) shifted from an area of focus (developing) to an area of celebration (proficient). 
Across classrooms, teaching practices are aligned to the curricula and reflect an articulated set of beliefs informed by 
instructional shifts that foster higher order thinking. Finally, indicator 2.2 (Assessment) was also identified as an area 
of celebration. Across classrooms, teachers use assessments and rubrics that are aligned to the CCLS and curricula.  

 

IS 206B has adopted the Code X materials for English Language Arts (ELA) and the CMP3 materials for math through 
the DOE curriculum materials option. As such, we are able to use the formative assessment materials provided in the 
adopted texts to differentiate instruction, group students, and provide data-drive feedback and next steps. Teachers 
monitor student progress by assessing students regularly and tracking outcomes. Additionally, teachers have the 
option to supplement materials and resources to fit the needs of ENLs, Students with Disabilities (SWDs), Tier 2, Tier 
3, and enrichment students. 

 

Grade level inquiry teacher teams meet every two weeks to discuss at-risk and struggling students in order to 
collaborate on teaching the whole child. Content teachers also meet every two weeks to analyze student data to 
inform instruction and modifty curriculum to meet the needs of students who do not meet the standards. Staff 
members who provide additional social, emotional, and academic supports such as guidance counselors, speech, 
English as a New Language (ENL), and Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS) providers work closely with 
teacher teams to provide scaffolds and modifications to support classroom instruction. 

 

During the 2018-2019 school year, teachers will participate in a Professional Learning Community model which offers 
a systems approach to school improvement. Vertical content-specific teams will work interdependently to achieve 
common goals for which members are mutually accountable. Throughout the year, team members will follow 
protocol to clarify the essential learning outcomes, establish consistent pacing; create frequent common assessments 
to monitor student learning, and agree on the criteria they will use to judge the quality of student work. Each team 
will use the evidence of student learning to identify individual students who need additional time and support, to 
discover problematic areas of the curriculum that require the attention of the team, and to help each member 
become aware of his or her instructional strengths and weaknesses.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23 

 

A new partnership we have formed for the coming school year is with Learning Partners Program. In order to grow 
one's practice, collaboration is important, and through LPP, we will work with partner schools and leverage the 
expertise and best practices of those schools to positively impact students and strengthen teacher pedagogy. Learning 
Partner teams, with LPP facilitators will take part in intervisitations, and meet bi-weekly to share, discuss, and turnkey 
these best practices to other staff members. 

 

We will continue to build upon the collaborative environment we pride ourselves on at IS 206B. In the 2018-2019 
academic year, we will focus on increasing cultural awareness during instruction and differentiating learning activities 
in order to create an inclusive classroom environment. Teachers will continue to study the whole child through inquiry 
team meetings and work together to make lessons relevant to student experiences. We also plan on facilitating inter-
visitations to learn from each other and showcase best practices and intra-visitations to observe teacher best 
practices at neighboring schools. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The 2016-2017 Quality Review Report, dated January 6, 2017, found indicator 4.2 (Teacher Teams and Leadership 
Development) to be an area of celebration for the school with a rating of proficient. The indication is that the 
majority of teachers at IS 206B are engaged in structured, inquiry-based professional collaborations. Teacher teams 
consistently analyze assessment data and student work and collaborate on how to best support the academic, 
emotional, and social growth of each child. According to the 2017-2018 NYC School Quality Survey, 98% of parents 
felt that the leadership at IS 206B is inclusive and 94% of teachers agreed that school leadership promotes 
instructional excellence. 

 

Grade level inquiry teacher teams meet every two weeks to discuss at-risk and struggling students in order to 
collaborate on teaching the whole child. Content teachers also meet every two weeks to analyze student data to 
inform instruction and modify curriculum to meet the needs of students who do not meet the standards. Staff 
members who provide additional social, emotional, and academic supports such as guidance counselors, speech, 
English as a New Language (ENL), and Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS) providers work closely with 
teacher teams to provide scaffolds and modifications to support classroom instruction. 

 

In order to develop effective school leadership, we have significantly increased opportunities for teachers to share 
best practices, learn from each other, and take on leadership roles. Teachers facilitate team and school-wide 
meetings, provide support in differentiated instruction and scaffolding, coach numerous sports teams and after-
school clubs, lead inquiry and student support teams, run the PBIS program, and reach out to parents and the 
community through school wide initiatives such as Career Day and Family Fun Night 

 

According to the 2016-2017 Quality Review Report, indicator 4.1 (Teacher Support and Supervision) was rated 
developing. In order to ensure that teachers receive actionable feedback from school leaders in a timely fashion, 
administration will calendar dates of observations and observe teachers regularly. In addition, administration will 
provide professional development opportunities and resources around improving pedagogy. Teachers will be 
encouraged to follow a protocol for peer inter-visitations. Administration will continue to provide actionable feedback 
regarding student work samples and bulletin boards.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

IS 206B has been working diligently to create strong family-community ties by welcoming, encouraging, and 
developing partnerships with families and community-based organizations. According to the 2016-2017 School 
Quality Survey, 98% of constituents view parent outreach positively, while 91% of constituents view parent 
involvement in school positively. IS 206B’s parents / guardians are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. Throughout the year, IS 206B supports parents by providing materials and teacher-led 
workshops to help parents work with their children to achieve academic success. Teachers and staff members 
regularly reach out to parents / guardians using various forms of communication including face-to-face meetings, 
email, and blast phone calls which has fostered a caring and effective home-school partnership. Additionally, IS 206B 
families have been invited to school events throughout the year such as the Winter Classical Music Concert, Blue Man 
Group Outing, Family Movie Night, Math / ELA/ Science Family Fun Night, and a monthly family breakfast celebrating 
high-achieving student leaders. In May, our teacher-led committee reached out to community members and 
organized our second annual IS 206B Career Day. During this half-day celebration, students and parents learned about 
different professions and heard key-note addresses of encouragement from three local community members 

 

IS 206B believes in having continuous open channels of communication with parents regarding their child’s education. 
The student goal sheets and interim report of progress is one way that we partner with parents to support student 
progress. Interim reports have an area marked for parent feedback and parents are encouraged to communicate with 
staff about their children’s learning and progress. Parents can monitor student grades and assignments using Engrade, 
an online grading system, which provides instant feedback. This system also offers teachers and parents the ability to 
communicate with each other regarding their student work. Holding parent meetings to discuss CCLS, communicating 
with parents in writing, and by phone are additional ways that we partner with parents to improve student 
achievement. The parent coordinator plays an important role in maintaining these open channels of communication 
with our parents. She holds monthly parent meetings on topics of interest and after conducting needs assessment 
surveys. As a result and thanks to an increase in parent/teacher contact and parent use of Engrade, we have seen a 
student performance growth trend. 

 

IS 206B believes in an open door policy for parents. The principal, assistant principal, and teaching staff will 
accommodate and meet with parents, who come to school unannounced and without an appointment. Parents are 
well aware of this policy as it is discussed with parents at all parent meetings. The principal also believes that open 
channels of communication need to exist with students and administration in order to understand their concerns and 
attempt to meet their needs. His door is always open and he is available to meet with students who have expressed a 
desire to do so.

IS 206B and our CBO, Good Shepherd Services, have been working to continue implementing an extended school day 
model with support from TASC (The After School Corporation) for the last four years. The school pays for 1 teacher to 
run the Homework Cafe as a part of the Good Shepherd Services.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, IS 206B will increase parent participation in school-wide engagement and education events as evidenced 
by a 10% increase in parent attendance.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
When a vacancy occurs, postings are placed on the DOE’s Teacher Finder and interviews are conducted to ensure that 
all new hires are highly qualified for the position that they are applying for. The principal maintains close contact with 
the district HR liason to ensure that all staff is and remains highly qualified. 

In order to retain staff, attention is taken to ensure that teachers have the necessary materials and support to do 
their job. Care is taken to keep communication open and to encourage a school climate that makes working in teams 
a comfortable way to accomplish tasks. 

Teachers are assigned for the year based on their area of certification.  

The entire school has been trained in the SIOP Model of making content comprehensible for ENLs. Additional training 
will be provided this school year in-house facilitated by IS 20B staff. The entire staff has been trained in the Collins 
Writing program, "Improving Student Performance Through Writing and Thinking Across the Curriculum." Training for 
new staff and a refresher course for veteran staff is offered to ensure that the use of the process is remaining true to 
the original training. PD will be presented by school staff using the contractual time on Mondays that has been 
established for this purpose. 

IS 206B has partnered with MSQI who will provided tiered professional development on implementing strategic 
reading periods, incorporating debate, collecting and analyzing student data in order to inform instruction, Reading 
Like a Historian, and Thinking Like a Scientist programs.

Training in using Mathletics online will be provided to all math teachers. Training for new staff and a refresher course 
for veteran staff will be presented by school staff. With a newly established computer lab, we will provide ongoing 
professional development in Science, Literacy, and Art. 

The school has contracted with The Executive Leadership Institute, the PD branch of the CSA, to provide training for 
all staff in the use of questioning and discussion techniques in all content areas and application of the instructional 
shifts. The CCLS require an increased emphasis on discourse and argument in both literacy and math, which has 
significant implications for the ways teachers engage students in discussion and the kinds of questions about which 
they ask students to think.

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
As it relates to accountability, a committee consisting of teachers, cabinet members and administration decided 
which assessments should be used as local measures of student progress. Teachers design and give formative 
assessments within each unit of study so that there is a measure of how students are progressing throughout the unit. 
Adjustments to the curriculum are made during the unit to reflect the specific needs of students in each class. The 
results from common unit assessments given at the end of each unit are collected and analyzed regularly by a team of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

teachers. Additionally, benchmark tests are given three times a year in ELA and math. The benchmark assessments 
are a part of the periodic assessment program of the NYC DOE.  

Professional development regarding the use of assessment results to improve instruction occurs during common prep 
periods for math and ELA. These sessions are run by the literacy and math coach. They consist of an examination of 
student data that has been laid out by individual student on a tracking sheet by standard. It is easy to see at a glance 
where the issues are by class and by individual student. The areas of concern are then addressed through AIS 
intervention services, 

 

During the 2017-2018 academic year, IS 206B will focus on developing common formative assessments that provide 
teachers and students with data to measure progress towards meeting standards in science and social studies. At IS 
206B, we understand the importance of assessment in the instructional process and engage in activities to ensure 
that assessment are aligned to the curricula and provide data to enable our teachers to make the necessary 
adjustments/ modifications to each unit of study and to their practices. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. I.S. 206, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

IS 206B will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

  Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement 

level in literacy, math and the use of technology. 

  Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and

improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between 
parents and other members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the 
proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and 
improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

  Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 

school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 
implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact. 

  Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are 

allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting 
skills. 

  Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement is utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school's Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact. 
Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, 
the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes 
providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership 
skills. 

  Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office. 

  Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 

accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home. 

  Provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report. 

  Host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 
parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their 
right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 
1118 and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). 
Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of 
the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions. 

 

  Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

IS 206B's Extended School Day  program will focus on beginner English as a New 
Language (ENL) students in grades 6, 7 and 8.  Two bilingual common branch teachers will 
work on English language development with groups of 10-15 students.  Programming will 
include the use of the WILSON phonics program, ILit online literacy intervention program, and 
targeted spelling, vocabulary, and grammar instruction. The program will begin in November 
2018 and run through June 2019.  Students will receive instruction three days a week for 
approximately two hours each session.  This program will primarily be funded with focus school 
dollars. 
Additionally, a bilingual common branch teacher will work during her prep periods, four days a 
week with sixth grade beginners on English language development with groups of 3 to 6 
students.  Programming will include the use of the iLit online literacy intervention program and 
targeted spelling, vocabulary, and grammar instruction. vocabulary and sentence structure.   
The same research driven materials will be used for both programs in order to provide consistent, 
sound instruction to our beginner ENL students.  The broad range of curriculum materials allows 
for flexibility in planning for both the school week program and the extended week program.

The entire school  has been trained in the SIOP Model of making content comprehensible for 
ENL learners.  The original training was provided by Pearson Education with continued 
professional development provided by in-house staff. The entire staff has been trained in the 
Collins Writing Program, "Improving Student Performance Through Writing and Thinking 
Across the Curriculum."  Refresher courses are offered to staff members to ensure that the use of 
the process is remaining true to the original training.  Collins Writing training will focus on type 
1 and type 2 writing (quick writes while accessing prior knowledge and quick checks for 
understanding),   type 3 writing (first draft writing focusing on 4-5 items), and type 4 and type 5 
writing (revising, editing, and publishing writing).  The process is clear and structured and 
supports ENLs through the writing process.  The quick writes build writing fluency while 
accessing prior knowledge and assessing for understanding.  The Type 3 writing limits the 
number of factors being considered in the draft and makes the process comprehensible and

from peers and the teacher.  T 
One teacher has been trained in the WILSON phonics program through the WILSON Language 
Training Program.   Another teacher will be trained this summer by Middle School Quality 
Initiative (MSQI).  This research based program will support phonics development for our 
beginner ENLs.  Students will receive WILSON instruction for 30 minutes five days a week for 
the entire school year.  
One teacher has been trained to use the iLit online literacy intervention program by Pearson 
.  Additional teachers will be trained as needed.  iLit is a comprehensive digital and blended print 
literacy program that helps engage readers and accelerate literacy skills and language 
development. The program provides extensive digital and print libraries, lessons with 
personalized support, progress tracking, and a built-in rewards system.  

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
In January, Ms. Nunez, a Title-3 ELA teacher, will present an hour and a half  workshop for 
parents entitled, " Supporting your child's development in literacy through the Common Core" in 
both English and Spanish.  In February, a second one and a half hour workshop entitled, 
"Supporting your child's development in mathematics, through the Common Core."  will be 
presented by Ms. Acevedo,  a Title III-funded math teacher in both English and Spanish. The 
rationale for both sessions is to engage the parents in working with the school on moving 
students to higher levels of academic achievement by providing tools and methods that can be 
used at home to reinforce the work that is being done in school.  Parents will be notified by mail 
and reminders will be sent via phone blast.  Additionally, our parent coordinator will 
hold monthly informational meetings for parents. To date, these have included the following 
topic. 
November, 9:00 - 11:00 AM: Talking to Your Children about bullying in  and out of school.  
December, 9:00 - 11:00 AM: Child Development and Sexuality 
January, 9:00 - 10:00 AM: Opening the Lines of Communication 
February, 9:00 - 11:00 AM: How can we support our children in their language development?  
March, 9:00 - 10:30 AM: Cyber-bullying and Social Media 
All of these meetings are translated to provide the information for both Spanish speaking and 
English speaking parents.   Translation services are also provided during all parent meetings with 
staff and during parent and teacher conferences.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The assessment tools for early literacy skills of our ENLs are the NYSITELL, Spanish LAB, and the DRP.  The NYSITELL and 
Spanish LAB are administered to all first time admits to our school, provided that the HLS and interview indicate that the tests 
are warranted. Subsequently, the NYSESLAT is given annually. In addition to these state tests, students are administered the 
DRP reading assessment three times a year to monitor progress in reading comprehension.  Students who fall below a score of 
45 on the DRP assessment are also tested using secondary diagnostics such as the TOSWRF (Test of Silent Word Reading 
Fluency) and WIST (Word Identification and Spelling Test)  to determine intervention programs such as WILSON and STARI.  62 
of the 66 students tested using the DRP were assessed using a secondary diagnostic.  It was determined that 35 students 
needed additional assistance with decoding words.  Additionally, all ENLs are assessed on planning, the writing process, 
sentence variations, voice, lead sentences, audience, structure of piece, revision strategies, editing strategies, paragraphing, 
sentence structure, elaboration, spelling, vocabulary variation, setting, transitioning, handwriting legibility, and any other skills 
the teacher may choose to examine such as verb agreement or punctuation. These assessments are tabulated, studied,

compared, and tracked to help group the students according to their proficiency in their L1. This will consequently allows us to 
place the students in various leveled ENL programs ranging from beginning literary where they use the development of BICS 
(Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills) in their L1 and allow us to achieve CALPS (Comprehension Academic Language 
Proficiency Skills) in L1, they are provided instruction in the native language. Students that show developed CALPS in L1 are 
transferred to intermediate ENL classes in addition to their ELA class period where the use of their L1 is further developed and 
transitioned to L2 as they advance the language proficiency. ENLs’ language development is reinforced through native 
language instruction in reading and writing. Once they transition to CALPS in L2, they are expected to perform in the L2.  
 
A retired bilingual teacher, Mr. Alfonseca, was hired to work with ENLs three to four days a week from January to May 2018. 
The focus will be on language acquisition and mathematics. In addition, there will be a continuation of the implementation of 
Balanced Literacy, Code X, and the Collins Writing Program throughout all content areas. We will continue to implement the 
strategies of CMP3 in mathematics as well as the SIOP model for lesson planning.  
Efficient use and expansion of the extended school day programming for ELL students with grouping of 10 to 1 teacher student 
ratio. The expansion of the extended day after school program for ENLs in is in conjunction with the Good Shepherd after 
school program and is aimed to develop language acquisition in both ELA and math. Five teachers will be hired to work with 
small groups of students two days in ELA/ENL and two days in math.  
    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Mr. Mercado, the ENL coordinator, administers the HLS, interviews, Spanish LAB and NYSITELL.  He also maintains an ENL 
compliance binder with reports such as the RLER and RLAT.  Admin staff assist him with the filing of these documents.  
 
All English teachers administer the DRP reading assessment three times a year and collect benchmark writing samples which 
are all placed in the students' portfolios.  These results are tabulated on tracking sheets.  Teachers then confer with each other 
regarding the strengths and next steps of the students during common preps and meetings.    
 
 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our ELL programs is evaluated through student performance as reflected in program end products, the school 
progress reports, post running records (TCRWP), DRP, midline and end line writing samples, progression along the writing 
continuum and the following standardized tests: NYSESLAT, NYS ELA test, NYS Mathematics test, NYS Science, NYS PET and the 
ELE. 
 
Secondary diagnostics in reading have determined that a majority of our ENLs need further development of decoding 
skills.  Some students will be using WILSON while others will be working on reading skills and strategies with the ENL teacher. 
 
Benchmarks assessment have shown that students need continual growth in vocabulary development.  In collaboration with 
MSQI, we have implemented the research based program, Word Generation Series 2 ,in all content areas, which focuses on 
vocabulary acquisition through discussion, debate, and research.  Additionally, students will have the opportunity to 
participate in structured debate tournaments through the NYC Urban Debate League. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Results from period assessments in ELA and math as well as the DRP are tabulated on tracking sheets and analyzed.  Teachers 
use the data to form differentiated flexible groupings to provide targeted instruction on specific skills and strategies . Teachers 
collaborate during weekly common planning meetings, inquiry team meetings, and data analysis discussions. The ENL teacher 
is in constant discussion with all content area teachers to plan lessons and strategically plan  next steps for students. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

Before the school year begins, the NYSESLAT results are analyzed, and ENL students are grouped according to language 
proficiency levels. 
 
Students who are struggling with specific skills and strategies in ELA and math, are given additional small group instruction in 
class as well as pull-out AIS services by designated teachers.  Additionally, we have scheduled  strategic reading periods three 
times a week where students are grouped homogeneously and provided specific interventions / enrichment based on their 
needs such as WILSON (T3), Just Words (T3), reciprocal teaching (T2), and Socratic Seminars (T1). At this time, the ENL teacher 
also provides targeted instruction to ENL students in the class .  
 
Additionally, newcomers and S.I.F.E. students are given remedial work in the form of grammar exercises, NYSESLAT prep 
books, and reading/writing workbooks.     
    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The RLAT is used initially to evaluate the ENL population.  In our analysis of the NYSESLAT data we found that 8% performed at 
the entering level, 37% of the students performed at the expanding level across the grades, 12.5% performed at the 
commanding, 12.5% emerging and 29% performed at the transitioning level across the grades. This year we had an increase in 
the number of students who scored at the expanding level in grade six through eight.  Many students also scored at 
the transitioning level.  
 
The NYSESLAT data reveals that S.I.F.E.S. tended to do poorly on speaking and writing sections. However, in the reading and 
listening portions of the assessment, they were able to score at a higher level. 
 
Lastly, for the more advanced students, the ELA benchmark assessments and DRP reading assessment can be used to evaluate 
students and measure growth.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Teachers collaborate during weekly common prep meetings, inquiry team meetings, and data analysis discussions.   Teachers 
collaboratively analyze student work to determine next steps for targeted instruction.  Additionally, teachers share best 
practices through inter-visitations and lesson planning.    Teachers follow the plan, teach, assess, re-teach model during weekly 
PLC meetings. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Mr. Mercado, a certified ENL and ELA teacher, provides both the integrated and standalone components of 
the freestanding/pull-out ENL program.  Mr. Mercado also schedules the mandated services by pulling the ENL 
students from their strategic reading, social studies and science periods.   
 
Commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated instruction per week.  Transitioning and expanding students 
are pulled out for 180 minutes.  Transitioning students receive 90 of integrated instruction while expanding students 
receive 180 of standalone instruction.  Entering and emerging students are pulled- out for 360 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

minutes.  Entering students receive 180 minutes of integrated instruction while emerging students receive 90 minutes 
of integrated instruction.  The ENL teacher provides language development support and scaffolding to promote 
language achievement.   
 
Students are grouped homogeneously according to language acquisition levels and grade in order to provide targeted 
instruction to meet students' specific academic needs.             

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A        

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A   

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

In order to ensure that each student receives the mandated number of instructional minutes, the level of each student must 
be ascertained by looking up their NYSESLAT scores or their NYSITELL scores if they haven't taken the NYSESLAT yet.  Then, a 
spreadsheet is generated with the required hours listed.  Finally, when the schedule is made, it is necessary to tally each 
period to ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes are met.  
 
Entering students receive 2 units of study per week(360 min.): 1 unit of stand-alone ENL and 1 unit of integrated 
ENL.  Emerging students also receive 2 units of study: .5 unit of study in ENL. and 1 unit of integrated.  There is flexibility 
because .5 a unit can be either type of instruction.  Transitioning level students receive 1 unit of study: .5 is integrated and the 
other .5 can be either integrated or stand-alone.  Expanding level students receive 1 unit of integrated 
instruction.  Commanding level students receive .5 unit of integrated.    
      
ENL instruction is delivered by the certified TESOL/ELA instructor.  He teaches both the ENL stand alone program and the 
integrated portion because he is dual certified.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The delivery system for instruction in ELA is a balanced literacy approach which consists of independent reading, 
paired/shared reading, guided reading, literature circles, writer’s workshop, guided writing, the Collins Writing Program, 
interactive read alouds, academic vocabulary acquisition, word study, and teacher/student conferencing in both reading and 
writing.  All instruction and curricula is based on the  Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS). 
 
The 6th , 7th and 8th grade ELA curriculum includes resources such as Code X, Word Generation, and various CCLS aligned 
texts.  Teachers create flexible groups to target specific needs based on data.  Students are scheduled for a total of 90 minutes 
of instruction in the area of ELA each day.  Three of the ELA periods are designated as Strategic Reading Periods (SRP) where 
students receive differentiated instruction based on their specific reading level as determined by the DRP and formative 
assessments. 
 
Instruction in mathematics is through a workshop model for 90 minutes each day. Teachers provide both whole class 
instruction and targeted small group instruction during the time.  The 6th , 7th and 8th grade curriculum in math includes 
resources such as CMP3(Connected Math), Engage NY, and other CCLS math problems. Additionally, our main focus 
throughout the school is the development of academic language in math. Many of our students struggle with the language of 
mathematics. Mathematical concepts are introduced and reviewed using different modalities to ensure that the work is 
accessible to every student. 
 
The native language will be used to introduce new concepts as needed. We will ensure students’ success by 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

utilizing periodic interim assessments along with data from other forms of assessments throughout the year to identify areas 
of weakness and inform teacher planning, and improve student performance on interim assessments and predictive 
assessments. Assessment results are analyzed, and instructional adjustments are made to ensure that each student is making 
progress.  Performance indicators on the mastery tracking sheets that are a part of the standards based curriculum initiative 
are also analyzed, and adjustments are made to ensure that each student is making progress.   
 
Science and social studies are delivered in English. All staff, inclusive of content area teachers are trained with the SIOP model 
for lesson planning. The SIOP model places emphasis on content and language objectives. In both social studies and science 
classes, the bottom line for ENLs is that content objectives (learning targets) are written in terms of what students will learn to 
do, are stated simply, orally and in writing and tied to specific grade level content standards. The second feature of the SIOP 
model for ENLs is that language objectives are clearly defined, displayed and reviewed with students. As with content 
objectives, language objectives are stated clearly and simply and students are informed of them, both orally and in writing. 
The third feature of the SIOP model is that content concepts are appropriate to a child's age and educational background. In 
social studies and science classrooms, teachers ensure that materials are adapted to meet the needs of ENL's with the support 
of the ESL teacher.  This model provides meaningful activities that incorporate lesson concepts in social studies and science 
with language practice opportunities.   
 
Four teachers are also certified in bilingual education. They provide native language support for ENLs in the classroom. 
Bilingual dictionaries, glossaries and materials in the native language are available for additional support of language 
development. We also have social studies and science textbooks available in Spanish for all grade levels.  Trade books in the 
students' native language are available in classrooms and in the library. In addition, social studies and science teachers meet 
during their professional periods to plan and discuss instructional needs of the ENLs. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Students are assessed in their home language through the ELE, baseline writing in Spanish, as well as formative and summative 
assessment in the Spanish LAB. Our students have the opportunity to receive their state math and science exams in their 
native language. If the student and teacher agree that the translated exam would best meet students' needs, then the English 
version is given. We also use ENL predictive exams and we create our own simulated exams to prepare students for state 
assessments. Math simulation tests in Spanish are given three times a year before the actual state test. In our content areas 
assessments are created for our student population and our ENL-wide assessments. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Instruction is differentiated and scaffolded for all ENLs according to their proficiency levels and their individual needs. All forms 
of data such as ENL and ELA interim assessments, NYSESLAT, DRP, ELA, and mathematics scores, teacher created assessments, 
portfolios, and conferences with students are reviewed and used consistently throughout the academic year to guide 
instruction and grouping. In addition, extended after school and Saturday school programs will provide our ENLs with 
opportunities to continue their English language development. 
 
SIFE - Our instructional plan is modified for any ENLs identified as SIFE. To service the unique needs of SIFE  
students, groupings are based on their literacy skills.  SIFE students receive interventions during after school and Saturday 
school programs. These students require assistance transitioning to a formal educational setting. SIFE students work with the 
certified ENL teacher to learn and refine their basic, ENL, Math and HL skills. In addition, during the length of the program, 
students build fundamental reading and writing literacy through explicit instruction at their level. SIFE students are also 
supported to access the curriculum through pull-out AIS support in their content classes. Students' progress is assessed 
periodically during each marking period in order to evaluate interventions. Additionally, SIFE students are supported in their 
social emotional and academic development demands. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 
NEWCOMER -  Newcomer students in grades 6 through 8  participate in a Saturday school ENL class where an intensive ENL 
program is implemented and is taught by a certified ENL teacher as well as three bilingual teachers who focus on the 
language needs and language development of ENLs. In addition, IS 206 supplemental programs aid in meeting the needs 
of newly arrived ENLs, as well as those ENLs who are scoring at the lowest levels in English proficiency and are at a level one 
in mathematics and ELA. These students will be provided with extra help to support language acquisition as well as to develop 
both concrete and abstract mathematical concepts. 
Our extended-day program is run in conjunction with Good Shepherd Services, a community-based after-school program 
where in three bilingual teachers and two general education teachers participate alongside the Good Shepherd staff to provide 
instruction to students in both ELA and Math from grades 6 through 8. Our teachers also provide supplementary instruction 
and test preparation/sophistication strategies in the core content areas in order to improve language skills in math, science, 
and reading, writing, listening, and speaking. In addition to the math and ELA components, this program provides homework 
help, access to the school library, arts programs, technology programs, robotics, sports, music and more which helps support 
our goal of developing academic language in all content areas. Academic experiences are complemented by trips, cultural 
experiences and sound instructional practices that promote language development and acquisition. 
 
DEVELOPING - Developing ENLs (4 to 6 years) receive instruction at their appropriate language level which results in achieving 
a higher level of English language acquisition. Students within four to six years of service require more time in improving 
English language skills in all modalities. Students are grouped homogeneously during strategic reading periods three times a 
week.  During this time, students are provided targeted instruction in reading comprehension through WILSON, STARI, and 
reciprocal teaching.  Additionally, teachers provide small group AIS instruction for long term ENLs.  The ENL teacher also 
provides ENL pull-out services for entering and emerging ENL students in general-education classes. Saturday School and the 
Title III after school programs will be are utilized to meet the specific needs on ENLs in ELA and math. Students work on 
increasing academic and language abilities as well as decreasing gaps in academic progress. The after school program is 
instructed by classroom teachers who focus on ENL strategies. Additionally, students with IEPs are provided  stand-alone 
and/or integrated services by the SETSS provider and the ENL teacher. 
 
 
LONG TERM - Long term ENLs who struggle with reading comprehension and writing across all the content areas are provided 
stand-alone and integrated services by the ENL teacher.  Additionally they receive content area support during 
AIS intervention periods.  Teachers plan lessons using the SIOP model and use data to differentiate instruction and support 
flexible small groups.  Long term ENLS are also required to attend Saturday School and extended day programs.  Students with 
IEPs are either supported in 12:1 or 12:1:1 classrooms or through SETSS support services.  The SETSS teacher, ENL teacher, and 
classroom teachers work collaboratively to provide the level of support necessary to promote growth in all content areas. 
 
FORMER ENLs - ENL students who reach the Commanding Level on the NYSESLAT continue receiving 90 minutes of integrated 
ENL provided by the ENL teacher each week.  Students will receive these services for an additional two years after reaching the 
Commanding Level on the NYSESLAT. 
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers of ENL-SWDs use the following instructional strategies and grade level materials that provide access to academic 
content areas and accelerate English language development: 
In addition to the NRSI method which is an individualized approach to the specific reading instructional level of the ENLs, the 
Collins Writing Program adapted to individual student's needs, and targeted instruction during Strategic Reading Periods, AIS 
periods are designated to give additional support to ENL-SWDs. Additionally, the SIOP model for lesson planning addresses the 
ENL-SWDs by focusing instruction around content and language objectives. We ensure that our ENL students with special 
needs receive the same opportunity to participate in all programs available to all ENLs by providing them with additional 
support to further develop their academic language. Resource room services for ENLs with special needs also follow Language 
Allocation Policy mandates.       

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our ENLs with special needs receive the same opportunities to participate in the same instructional programs available to all 
our ENLs.  ENLs with special needs are provided services according to the IEPs, and their ENL instructional minutes are tracked 
using the report of service for all students with special needs.   The SIOP model for lesson planning, the NRSI method and 
Collins Writing Program are adapted to meet IEP instructional minutes. 
 
The ENL teacher pulls-out  the ENL-SWDs to provide language service and support during content periods. Additionally, periods 
are built into teachers' programs to further support our ENLs through AIS groups. Teachers are also provided regular time to 
meet and discuss the needs of ENL-SDW students, as well as their developing strengths, to analyze assessment and adapt 
planning and instruction accordingly.       
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ENLs  are targeted with specific intervention programs and strategies in English and in their native language to improve the 
performance in ELA, math and other content areas. Our ENL students receive the following interventions:   
In addition, teacher analyze student data from formative and summative assessment such as the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, Spanish 
LAB, Gates Macginities, and ELE, and use findings to drive instruction and create flexible groupings.  Teachers collaborate and 
share data / best practices weekly during common planning periods, inquiry team meetings, and data analysis discussions.  All 
discussions around student academic growth is focused around ENLs and SWDs.  Teachers plan lessons collaboratively using 
the SIOP model for lesson planning.      
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

IS 206B will continue improving our current school programs for this upcoming school year to ensure students are 
academically successful and on the path to college and career readiness.  During the 2017 - 2018 academic year, we will be 
implementing the following new initiatives: 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

For 2016-2017, the bilingual program was closed due to a limited number of staff. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ENLs are afforded a vast variety of support services and activities.  These include reduced class sizes, small group instruction 
by teaching staff during the class period and as AIS intervention services, extended day and Saturday programs specifically 
for ENLs, and participation in a Homework House which is run every day after school by our CBO. ENL students are afforded 
participation in extended day tutoring, debate team, technology-focused clubs, class trips, library and computer access, sports 
programs, music programs, and PBIS incentive trips and events.Participation in the Student Council and Chess Clubs is also 
encouraged. ENLs are given every opportunity to participate in all school sponsored activities and events.       
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
In order to advance students’  levels in all content areas, students receive instruction in all content areas that focuses on 
academic language acquisition in order to increase their academic language abilities in the four language modalities.  All 
classrooms have been equipped with materials such as interactive smart-boards, computers, tablets, tape recorders and books 
on tapes. Various textbooks and test sophistication programs are utilized to help support instruction and prepare students for 
the NYSESLAT, ELA, math, and science exams. Classroom libraries offer newcomers and students at all language proficiency 
levels independent reading books in their home language and at various reading levels.  Each classroom also has textbooks 
translated in Spanish to support students.   In addition, our Media center is equipped with computers with sophisticated 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

programs to develop language development.  Finally, we will be using ILit, a computer program from Pearson that 
offers grammar and reading instruction for ENLs.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

The ENL population is serviced by a certified ENL teacher. The ENL teacher will work in collaboration with classroom teachers 
and the SETSS teacher to support all ENLs in and out of the classroom.  The ENL teacher will meet the required minutes as 
mandated for ENLs at all levels.  ENL methodologies and the use of Home Language Arts will help scaffold the students’ 
learning.  Supplemental resources such as our bilingual libraries, and Home Language books with high interest reading books in 
both in English and Spanish will be utilized during our instructional school day. All teachers will continue to plan lessons using 
the SIOP model and will receive professional development around ENL strategies that should be utilized in all classrooms. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

It is important to determine a student’s reading level, so that appropriate materials can be given for instruction. For example, 
students are given the DRP at the beginning of the year to approximate their reading level.  DRP data is used to group students 
into homogeneous groups.  During Strategic Reading Periods, students in homogeneous groups receive targeted instruction 
based on needs.  DRP scores are also used to approximate a student’s lexile score and provide appropriate independent and 
instructional materials.   
  
Mainstream texbooks and resources are adapted for ENLs by the ENL teacher and classroom teacher.  Grade level materials 
are also adapted to accommodate the needs of ENLs.  Adaptations include: target vocabulary that is translated into Spanish, 
pictures, language objectives that coincided with the content being taught, sentence starters, sentence frames, etc.  ENLs are 
provided glossaries and laptops.   
 
ENL students receive support in learning academic vocabulary.  The Intermediate and Advanced students are currently using 
the AVT toolkit.  Studies show a direct correlation between a student’s knowledge of academic vocabulary and their academic 
success.  All students participate in Word Generation across all content areas.  On a weekly basis, students are introduced to 
five vocabulary words through discussion and debate opportunities by reading an article about a debatable topic.  The words 
are used across all content areas during the week, and students are asked to write a short argumentative essay each Friday 
where they state their claim and justify it with evidence from the text.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school is not shared.  However, In order to advance students’  levels in all content areas, we instruct students with 
rigorous lessons that increase their academic language abilities in the four language modalities.  All ENLs' classrooms have 
been equipped with materials such as interactive smart-boards, computers, tablets, tape recorders and books on tapes. We 
also use various textbooks and test sophistication programs that prepare students for both the NYSESLAT, and ELA exams. Our 
classroom libraries offer our newcomers and students at all language proficiency levels textbooks in their home language.   In 
addition, our Media center is equipped with a computer lab where sophisticated programs to develop language development 
were installed.  We make use of the researched-based National Reading Styles, in particular CARBO.  ENL teachers, along with 
all other teachers in the school are trained in CARBO and therefore are able to use the strategies of the CARBO method in their 
classrooms.       
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
A series of open house invitations to parents and newly enrolled students are scheduled for the spring and for the summer. 
Newly arrived students, whose English is limited, are invited to participate in a series of parent and student orientations that

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional development opportunities are offered to all staff members, including paraprofessionals, guidance counselors , 
special education teachers, psychologists, speech therapists, secretaries and the parent coordinator at IS 206B.  The following 
professional development opportunities will be put in place in order to support staff to meet the needs of our ENL population 
as well as our wider student population:   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The support provided to our staff to assist ENLs as they transition from one level to another in our school is extensive. Grade 
level meetings and parent meetings are held at the beginning of the school year to explain our school procedures and 
expectations to parents and students. The teachers are trained to understand the physical, social and academic needs of 
groups of students. 
 
The guidance counselor and parent coordinator ensure that our students have continuity of services by maintaining contact 
with our feeder elementary schools.  Our parent coordinator and our guidance counselor are trained and help families with the 
high school application process. They provide ongoing support by conducting meetings to explain high school choice and to 
facilitate the transition of ENLs from middle school to high school.   In addition, our assistant principal, parent coordinator and 
the ENL teacher keep staff members informed about  federal, state and local mandates for ENLs.  As a result, school staff is 
more responsive to the questions and concerns of parents of ENLs. 
  
All new teachers will receive SIOP model training, Collins Writing Program training and the National Reading Styles Institute 
training.  Professional development and training will be facilitated in house by staff that specializes in language acquisition. 
Other trainings will be offered through Fordham University Bilingual ENL Technical Assistance Centers (BETAC), BETAC offers 
technical support in the identification process of ENLs and other state mandates. Additionally, teachers will also have the 
opportunity to attend ENL professional institutes and workshops such as the Quality Teaching for English Language Learners 
(QTEL). Sign-in sheets and agendas for all professional development are filed by the assistant principal.      
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

 

Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
At IS 206 we recognize that families and other community members are a vital part of all students’ academic and social 
success, and consider family involvement an essential ingredient for a successful educational program.  The school conducts 
numerous parent workshops and has an active parent coordinator and PA president.  Our parent coordinator also coordinates 
activities and fairs for parents and students to attend at school.  Parent involvement in the school is encouraged by sending 
translated notification of monthly informational meetings sponsored by our parent coordinator in both Spanish and 
English.  These meetings focus on providing information which supports students and families.  Additionally, parent meetings 
focused on ENL parents and students are held twice each semester during the school day and twice each semester on 
Saturdays.  The focus of these meetings is providing parents with information related to the academic program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results and language development needs in all content areas; and 
what they can do to support the work that the students are doing in school. All parents meetings are in both conducted English 
and Spanish. We organize special events for parent involvement ( parents / students math nights, Health providers to educate 
parents on how to get or renew health plans. CPR training, ENL parental orientations, annual meeting, workshops, and a 
parent appreciation day.  In addition, our annual school fair is held in June.  This fair brings the school community 
together.  Dozens of vendors, community businesses, school leaders students, parents and other members from from our 
school community attend.             

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
The parent coordinator hosts monthly parent meetings conducted by outside providers on topics of interest to parents such as 
cyber bullying and asthma control. Translation will be provided in Spanish for all parent meetings. Parents of ENLs are involved 
in our school because of the support offered in the students’ native language.  To address the needs of all parents including 
the parents of ENLs, the materials and training will be provided in English and Spanish.  Information about school and parent 
related programs, meetings and other activities related to the school will be mailed home monthly in both Spanish and 
English.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, I, Rafael Cabral, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

To assess language preferences of our parents' community for both written and oral communication, the 
following data and methodologies are used.  

  When parents register students, parents are surveyed to identify their language of preference.  
  Home Language Identification Surveys (HLIS) are conducted for parents who are new to the New York City 

Department of Education (NYCDOE) and the data collected are inputted into the ATS system for data 
records. ATS is used to identify the preferred home languages of families who have already taken the 
HLIS. 

  ATS reports, such as reports that share preferred home languages and written and oral communication, 

lists parents' preferred languages for English as a New Language (ENL) students and non-ENL students. 
Feedback from parent - teacher meetings is used to assess parent communication needs.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

  The Environmental School Progress Report is also used to gauge if the school is meeting constituent 

expectations on communication. 

  Review of printed communications where the DOE or ISC did not provide translations from school 

personnel are conducted to determine translation needs. 

  Parent surveys are provided throughout the year to assess what language parents prefer when getting 

information related to school-wide procedures, policies, and expectations.  

  Data from the Parent Home Language Identification Survey results for all new registrants completed 

during the initial registration period is entered by the Pupil Accounting Secretary in the Parent Preferred 
Language Indicator in ATS. This data provides information that allows us to assess language preferences of 
the parent community. 

  ATS reports of preferred languages and data from teacher surveys are also used. The blue emergency 

cards provides information of the spoken and preferred language in the home.  

  Provide Language Access Kits to families as well as a multilingual welcome poster and language 

identification guide to parents.  

  Provide an informational brochure about the Translation and Interpretation Unit of the NYCDOE to all 

parents. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of a school emergency, we communicate with all of our families, including those with limited-English-
proficiency, via phone calls and message blasts. All communication will be translated into Spanish by our designated 
bilingual staff members. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76 

 

In addition, we will use over-the-phone translation services to communicate with all our families. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

We will review Chancellor's Regulation A-663 with all staff members during their professional development day in 
September and October 2018 . All staff received a hard and digital copy of Chancellor's Regulation A-663. Staff 
members are designated as points-of-contact, and we ensure that designated staff members are on hand at all parent 
meetings to translate all communications into Spanish. In addition, staff are provided the Over-the-Phone Interpreter 
Services in order to support with communication with all families. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

 

  The school will provide each parent whose primary language is a covered language and who requires language 

assistance services with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities, which includes their rights 
regarding translation and interpretation services.  

  The school will post, in a conspicuous location at the entrance of the school, a sign in the most prominent 

covered language, indicating the availability of translation services (Language and Interpretation Unit). 

  The school safety plan will ensure that parents in need of language assistance services have access to the 

administrative offices and have translation services provided. We also use translation templates for school 
holidays, parent-teacher conferences, and other DOE notices available at the Translation and Interpretation 
Unit's intranet site: //intranet.nycboe.net/schoolsupport/translation-and-interpretation-unit.  

  During school meetings and gatherings with parents, the oral translation needs are provided by our staff 

members identified as fluent in the languages spoken by the population. A roster of bilingual staff who can be 
called upon to interpret is available. 
For languages other than Spanish, we use the interpretation services of the DOE.  
Flyers and brochures listing and describing language services are provided.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We use various mechanisms to gather feedback from parents. We survey all parent / community partners to 
determine to whom, how, and to what extent communication has occurred. Parent feedback is evaluated through the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77 

 

participation in the citywide parent survey. Parent survey results are used to determine workshop topics, quality of 
services, and other areas of concerns for the coming year.    

As part of the School Leadership Team, parents are also afforded the opportunity to voice their concerns and ideas 
about the quality and availability of services at IS 206B. Additionally, we will resurvey all parents to identify changes in 
original data. 

A preferred language survey, the Language Access Parent Survey, that is translated in a variety of languages is 
distributed at the the end of the school year to monitor the preferred languages of families.
