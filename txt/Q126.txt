Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

At I.S. 126, we are committed to our mission in providing a safe learning environment where all students are held 
accountable and reach high levels of academic achievement. We value open communication between parents, 
students, and teachers. Our school fosters a spirit of lifelong learning and establishes a community of productive 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

citizens. We promote intellectual curiosity and creative thinking where the entire community, the arts, and all 
cultures are valued.  

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The Albert Shanker School for Visual and Performing Arts is a Title I intermediate school located in District 30 in Long 
Island City, New York. The student body is comprised of 625 students (347 males, 278 females) in grades 6, 7, 8, with 
approximately 13% English Language Learners (70 students), 19% Students with Disabilities (108 students), and 30% 
Gifted and Talented (160 students). The diversity of our student body is reflected in the fact that 65% of our students 
(327 students) reportedly speak a language other than English at home.  

In order to strive towards this commitment in strengthening and supporting our school community, we have fostered 
key relationships with noteworthy community-based partners. Key partnerships include, but are not limited to, Zone 
126, YMCA, City Year and Enact . Zone 126 is a cradle to college program, providing services and workshops to parents 
to help them prepare their child for college. Additionally, they provide a summer camp program for students and help 
the school raise funds for student programs through donors in the community. Our partnerships with YMCA, City Year 
and Zone 126 provide us with after school and summer programs to build students’ academic, social & emotional 
needs while also fostering their leadership skills to be productive students and citizens. Collectively, we aim to 
prepare our students for success in high school, college and life beyond, and these coordinated supports are valuable 
to this cause.  

This year, I.S. 126 has been able to further demonstrate our commitment to the arts by expanding our Arts 
programming to include Art, Drama, and Chorus. This year we have continued our partnership with Alvin Ailey 
exposing our 6 th grade and 7 th grade students to different dance genres. We are continuing our partnership with 
Community Word Project this year which exposes our 6 th graders to various forms of written art. We are very proud 
of this grant since it allowed us to collaborate with one of our feeder schools. We also are going to continue to fund 
our ENact partnership. This program exposes out student to different ways to express themselves. It also teaches 
them how to deal with anger in a much more positive way than fighting.  

 

We are unique in that on every grade level, we have students in gifted classes, general education classes, ESL classes, 
integrated co-teaching classes and special education classes. Results from our Spring 2017 state exams indicate that 
59% of our students scored below proficiency level in ELA and 70% of our students scored below proficiency level in 
Math. While there is an urgent need to increase our students’ proficiency levels in ELA and mathematics, we are 
committed to promoting a culture for learning where all students persist in rigorous and challenging tasks and take 
risks as learners, ideally resulting in measured growth for all. To achieve this, our staff has committed to continue to 
study Carol Dweck’s work on growth mindset to encourage students to see risk-taking and making mistakes as a 
valuable part of the learning process. We are honored that I.S. 126 has been selected to continue to participate in the 
Learning Partners Program for the 2018-19 school year, with our focus of inquiry being on growth mindset. To address 
our struggling readers we will be continuing to utilize Achieve 3000 and I-Ready as Tier 2 support. . This year we will 
continue to implement a new ELA curriculum(Pearson-My Perspectives) and a new Math curriculum (Go-Math) which 
will have a strong core and will include Tiered 1-3 support along with scaffolding for all students.  

 

We will also continue to be a Restorative Justice school with a full time coordinator and social worker assigned to us. 
We have already trained over half our staff in Restorative practices and are planning to have the entire staff trained 
by 2020.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

As a school we need to focus on our ELL and Special Education Sub-groups. We have not been able to close the 
achievement gap with these 2 sub groups enough to help us meet AYP. We plan on using our existing system we have 
in place such as Pupil Path, Wilson and Achieve 3000 to closely monitor our Special Education and ELL sub groups and 
make sure that we are continuing to close the achievement gap in these 2 sub groups so we meet AYP. We also plan 
on implementing a new ELA curriculum (Pearson- My Perspectives) and a new Math curriculum ( Go-Math) this year, 
which will help us provide scaffolds to assist the 2 sub-groups with meeting AYP. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

During the 2017-18 school year, the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which we made the most 
progress were Collaborative Teachers and Supportive Environment. These 2 areas were identified as areas of 
strengths in my 2017-18 PPO. It was noted that Teachers have been visiting other ICT groups to observe best practices 
regarding checks for understanding and using the information to make instructional adjustments. It was also noted 
that during team meetings teachers discussed how they are using student assessment data, particularly item analysis 
reports and using this information to adjust curriculum and instruction to address areas of deficiency for whole class 
and small groups. Teachers explained that since they have been more strategic in assessing and monitoring student 
responses by standards, they have a better understanding of areas where students struggle and share practices with 
their colleagues that had higher scores in those areas. Teams indicated that although there is a common preparation 
period, there is not a clear schedule for team meetings. It was noted that we have created a supportive environment 
for our students regarding College Access to all and the implementation of the CA4A initiative. "High expectations that 
connect to college and career readiness are evident throughout the school community. These expectations are 
communicated to staff through the school’s handbook, during professional development sessions, weekly e-mail to 
staff and feedback from observations, walk-throughs and observation conferences. Academic and behavioral 
expectations are communicated to students in the school’s grading policy, lessons, assemblies and through the 
school’s growth mindset work. Through the school’s on-line grading system, I/O Education, students and families can 
monitor assignments, grades and communicate with teachers. Students are provided with opportunities to visit 
colleges/universities and participate in a career day to learn about various careers and the education required. As part 
of the College Bound and College Access for All student in their advisory wrote letters to different colleges. Recently 
they started receiving responses, including course program materials and college pennants." 

Our areas of focus for the 2018-2019 school year will be Monitoring and Revising. This is evidenced by it being 
identified as an area for improvement in my 2018 PPR. We plan on using existing system we have in place such as 
Datacation, Wilson and Perason to more closely monitor our Special Ed and ELL sub groups to help make sure that we 
are continuing to close the achievement gap in those 2 sub groups so we meet AYP. We also plan on continuing our 
implementation of our ELA curriculum (Pearson-My Perspectives) and a new Math curriculum(Go-Math) this year 
which will help us monitor and revise in order to meet AYP with those 2 sub groups. We will are also adding I-Ready as 
an RTI strategy for our targeted sub groups.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
3.5:  

 

Strengths 

  We had an SBO to create a 100 minute block of time that is used by teachers to meet in teacher teams every 
Monday in addition to creating common planning periods in their programs. In these meetings teachers look 
at student data and identify students that need Tier 1-3 help. 
Identified Students are placed in our Saturday Achieve Now Academy and scheduled for Wilson, or I-Ready 
during AIS periods. 

 

  We use benchmark exams which are aligned with the NYS Exam and CCLS and analyze the results at the 

teacher team time. 

  We use Datacation to create item analysis reports for the exams and track student progress during the year.  

Needs 

  There needs to be an increase in Teacher participation in “Data Driven Classroom” is needed in order to have 
a comprehensive system for using formative and summative assessments for long and short term curriculum 
planning that involves student reflection, tracking of and ownership of learning. 

  Pupil path is not utilized by all staff, parents/guardians and students, therefore not everyone can learn about 

students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to improve student learning. 

  Results from the 2018 ELA exam indicate that 59% of our students scored below proficiency level in ELA. 

Analysis of our item skills analysis shows that students struggle with vocabulary comprehension and making 
inferences.  

  Results from the 2018 Math exam indicate that 70% of our students scored below proficiency level in Math. 

Analysis of our item skills analysis indicate that students struggle with Math fluency and content area 
vocabulary.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified

priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, teachers across all content areas will work to incorporate advanced literacy instruction into our 
curriculum and methodology, as measured by a 4% increase in the number of students meeting proficiency in Math.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 

 

In September 2018, students will complete a pre-assessment in every subject to collect data based on 
students’ academic strengths and weaknesses in order to appropriately match multiple levels of students to 
tasks in the classroom. 

  Periodic formal assessments will be used to monitor students’ individualized growth. 
 

In February 2019, students will complete a post-assessment in all content areas, focusing on skills that were 
being appraised in September 2018. The results should reflect an increase of 3% in the number of students 
that are Proficient in ELA which will be more than halfway to our stated goal of a 5% increase. This data will 
then be utilized when creating groups in order to re-teach and enrich student academic growth.  

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 

  Teacher Created Benchmark exams 
 

Item Analysis created by Datacation will be administered every 6 weeks as a formative assessment to monitor 
and revise teaching activities as needed. 

  NYC Periodic assessments in ELA which are aligned with the ELA state exam. 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

5.2 

Strengths 

  We have a partnership with several agencies to help us mentor and provide social, emotional and academic 

support to our students.  

  The YMCA, Brain Power and City Year all provide social, emotional and academic supports to our students 

both during the day and after school. 

Needs 

  There is a need to fund Brain Power to provide Social and Emotional support for our staff and student 

population.  

5.3:  

Strengths 

  We use 7 th Grade Assembly Periods to discuss the importance of coming to school on time every day and 

provide mentors for students that we identify as chronically absent.  

  The YMCA and Brain Power will provide workshops for parents during school, after school and on Saturdays 

that provides learning experiences and promotes a safe and healthy school environment for families. .  

  We provide an Alternate Learning Center for students that are removed from a specific class or suspended for 

the entire day. Our teachers provide work for the students so they do not fall behind.  

Needs 

  There is a need to schedule Restorative Practice advisories for all 3 grades.  

5.4 

Strengths 

  We offer workshops to parents and students about chronic absenteeism as a means to effectively 

communicate the value of attendance and punctuality in order to maximize instructional time. 

  We hold Principal Summits once a month where we invite parents to come and meet with local agencies to 

help them receive social, emotional and academic support for their children.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          18 

 

  Many of our teachers are a part of the AAPBI institute.  

Needs 

  The Principal Summits need more advertisements to increase parent attendance.  
  A need to increase the number of teachers involved in the AAPBI institute. 

5.5:  

Strengths 

  We have a partnership with several agencies to help us mentor and provide social, emotional and academic 

support to our students.  

Needs 

● While we offer Pupil Path as a means of sharing data with the school community, not all parents are registered to 
use the site and not all staff are using the site to document student progress.  

Current 7 th grade chronic absenteeism data shows the following absentee rates; 71% were absent 0-8 days, 19% were 
absent 9-19 days, 7% were absent 20-37 days and 3% were absent 38 or more days this year. As a school community 
we need to work together to lower these rates.

Strengths 

  The school has a professional development committee in place, with a number of teachers providing 

professional development on best practices. This goal will address collaborative teachers by allowing the 
entire staff the opportunity to participate in and provide professional development though Professional 
Learning Cycles.  

Needs 

  Our 2017-18 PPO indicated that the the school needs a system in place where teachers can visit each others 

classrooms to look at best practices as identified by the administration.  

4.3 

Stengths 

  As indicated by the latest QR teaching practices are aligned to the CCLS and reflect a coherent sets of beliefs 

about how students learn best that is informed by the Danielson Framework for Teaching and the 
instructional shifts. Teaching strategies, including questioning, instructional scaffolds and routines 
strategically provide multiple entry points and high-quality supports and extensions into the curricula.  

Needs 

  Though the systems are in place we have still not met AYP in the Math or ELA in the Special Education and ELL 

sub groups.  

4.4 

Strenghts 

  Teachers have used Growth Mindset this year to give students greater ownership of their work as indicated 

by the 2018 PPO.

support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

2.2  

Strengths 

  The Principal uses distributive leadership to create the CEP and goals of the school. Input is gathered at SLT 

meetings and the CEP is shared with the staff via email.  

  The 2018 PPO indicates that teachers and school leaders have set high expectations for all students that are 

connected to college and career readiness. Students are provided with opportunities to visit 
colleges/universities and participate in a career day to learn about various careers and the education 
required. As part of the College Bound and College Access for All student in their advisory wrote letters to 
different colleges.  

Needs 

  We have not closed the achievement gap in ELA and Math enough to meet AYP with our Special Education 

and ELL population as indicated by the results of the 2018 ELA and Math exams.  

2.4  

Strengths 

  Teachers from different departments currently use pre-tests, benchmarks, baseline and Model State 
assessments to identify student’s areas of need or strengths. In the upcoming year we will implement 
coherent department wide unit assessments where data can be tracked using Data Driven Classroom(DDC) 
Exam Portal. Data collected will be analyzed as a way to identify misconceptions and best practices in 
different areas of the curriculum. In the upcoming year an instructional focus will be actionable feedback that 
is consistent across classrooms. It will focus on feedback that is actionable and aligned to the Growth Mindset 
as a way to help develop the academic and personal behaviors necessary to be college and career ready 
(persistence, communication, engagement, work habits and self-regulation). 

Needs 

  We have not closed the achievement gap in ELA and Math enough to meet AYP with our Special Education 

and ELL population as indicated by the results of the 2018 ELA and Math exams.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          26 

 

2.5 

Strengths 

  Through teacher observations, best practices have been identified within the Advance/Teachboost data 

system. Those teachers have shared those practices during professional development. The best practices to 
be identified in the upcoming year will be through the lens of the Growth Mindset. 60% of our students 
scored below proficiency level on the 2017 NYS ELA exam and 70% scored below profinciency on the NYS 
Math exams. In addition to strengthening students’ academic skills, the non-cognitive academic and personal 
factors must also be addressed. School leaders will identify teachers that are applying such strategies and 
facilitate in tracking the progress made by students who are exposed to them on a regular basis. Model 
classrooms will be established as a structure to promote teacher development and distributive leadership.  

Needs 

  The Growth Mindset strategies must be implemented by more teachers to reach more students.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the number of staff inter-visitations, with a focus on best practices, will increase by 10% as measured by 
inter-visitation logs and teacher reflections.

Strengths 

  As indicated by the 2018 School Survey the school consistently provides ongoing detailed communication with 

families through the Pupil Path online grading platform. Through Pupil Path, teachers, students and families 
engage in online conversations regarding student performance and progress toward academic goals.  

Needs 

  More parents must be involved with the use of Pupil Path as a way of communicating with the school and 

monitoring their child's progress.  

  Write and receive an Achieve Now Academy Grant to fund our Saturday Program 

 

6.5 

Strenghts 

  Teachers use Pupil Path as a way to communicate with parents and keep them updated on their children's 

progress.  

Needs 

  A method must be implemented to share school data to promote dialogue among parents, students, and 

school community members centered on student learning and success. The distribution of data will 
encourage families to utilize the information to advocate for necessary support services to enhance the 
academic, social, and emotional success of their children.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Prior to hiring a candidate, their credentials are verified by our Borough Field Support Center's (BFSC) HR Director to 
ensure that the candidate holds a valid NYS certification in that license area. The BEDS survey is reviewed by the 
Principal and the HR director who work with our school to ensure that every teacher’s assignment aligns with their 
license area so that all teachers are reported as Highly Qualified on the BEDS Survey.  
 
 Strategies and activities used to attract high-quality highly qualified teachers to our school include. 
 · Frequent communication with our BFSC HR Director when vacancies occur. 
 . Central Office of Talent and Recruitment partners with colleges and the BFSC HR Director partners with Central for 
assistance and guidance and for candidate referrals. 
 · Participating in Central Hiring Fair events where pre-screened HQT candidates are interviewed and recruited. 
 · Interviewing HQT candidates from The Open Market Hiring System and The Absent Teacher Reserve (ATR) Pool 
 · Establishing a rigorous interview protocol that includes intensive criteria for the selection of new staff members 
including demonstration lessons, interviews, and New York State certification/licensing. 

 

Strategies for teacher retention will include the following:  
 · Maintaining a teacher resource center and professional library to promote promising and effective practices. 
 · Teachers will be provided with curriculum maps, instructional resources and professional learning opportunities. 
 · Individualized PD plans are created for teachers to ensure continued improvement. 

All new teachers are provided a mentor.  

Teachers are encouraged to participate in Lunch and Learns, after school PDs and attend off site PD provided by BFSC 
Personnel.  
 
 In the very rare event, if a teacher’s status was deemed not HQT, the principal would consult with the BFSC Human 
Resources Director for guidance to ensure that the non-HQT teacher will meet all required documentation and 
assessment deadlines. This may include some form of counseling including encouraging the teacher to become HQT 
through the High Objective Uniform State Standard of Evaluation (HOUSSE) system

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. IS 126Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Albert Shanker School of Visual and Performing Arts - I.S. 126Q will support parents and families of Title I students 
by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

     Under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), all children must improve their academic 
achievement in order to attain proficiency on state academic achievement standards, state 
academic assessments, and be college and career ready. This applies to all English Language 
Learners as well; therefore I.S. 126 will provide its ELL students with supplemental instruction 
in an after-school program two days per week. Instruction will focus on building students’ 
advanced literacy skills in order to help students meet or exceed the Next Generation Learning 
Standards and achieve proficiency on all state and city assessments, as well as to prepare them 
for college or advanced careers.  The program will target ELLs who scored at the entering and 
emerging, as well as the transitioning levels on the 2018 NYSESLAT or NYSITELL, and/or are 
a level 1 or 2 on the 2018 State ELA and/or Math assessments. Parents of our ELLs will receive 
written notification along with an application to our Title III program in their preferred 
language to the greatest extent possible. In addition, we will send an electronic notification 
using our school-wide data system IO classroom (fka Skedula) and Phone Messenger. Our 
IO.com system is equipped to translate messages in the majority of our parents' 
preferred language of communication.  
Beginning in November through May, two fully certified teachers, one in ELA and  the other in 
Special Education-Generalist, will instruct classes two times a week, one and a half hours per 
session, from 2:25– 3:55.  A fully certified ENL teacher will provide additional support by 
teaching collaboratively with these teachers.  
     •  Classes will meet for 20 weeks, two sessions per week for one and a half hours each. 
     •  Group sizes will be maintained at 15-18 students per teacher. There will be two classes with 
a total  
          of 30-35 students. 
    •  Classes will be formed according to grade level. There will be a total of two classes; one 
will be comprised of sixth graders and the other a combination of seventh and eighth graders. 
. Attendance will be taken online for each session and an electronic folder containing all 
attendance records of student participants will be maintained by the ENL teacher/ENL 
Coordinator. 
    •  Instructional activities will integrate the language skills of listening, speaking, reading and 
writing and be delivered using a variety of ENL methodologies and strategies that are supported 
by scientifically based research. Students will engage in instructional tasks that are both 
cognitively challenging yet accessible. There will be a focus on the development of scaffolding 
techniques, building background, activating schema, cooperative learning tasks, and frequent 
opportunities for student led discussion that will help improve and deepen comprehension and 
higher order thinking skills. The use of interactive technology involving computers, i-pads, the 
Internet, and Triumph boards will be a major component of all lessons and instruction. 
    •  All instruction will be in English with native language support in order to help further 
develop the four language skills of reading, writing, listening, and speaking.    
     . Instructional programs and materials used will be supplemental and distinct from those used 
for daily instruction.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
        The literacy class will target two ranges of language proficiency levels. The first level will 
be composed of newcomers, those who have been in an English language school system less than 
two years and have an English language proficiency level ranging from entering to emerging as 
well as ELL students with disabilities (SWD) or with an interrupted formal education (SIFE) that 
are reading far below their grade level. The MobyMax program, will be used fo used as the main 
mode of literacy instruction with these students because it is designed to help struggling learners 
quickly catch up to grade level and close learning gaps. This program is both a reading and math 
interactive online program that is aligned to the state learning standards and supports English 
language acquisition. Specific skills of need and strength are identified through diagnostic tests 
and ongoing data reports are provided to teachers in order to monitor individual student progress. 
Reading selections are multigenre, multicultural with Lexile measures. Lessons include a focus 
on vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, reading comprehension and writing skills.  An added 
feature of the program is that it can be accessed at home and through a mobile 
app.                                                                             The second level will target both 
transitioning level ELLs and Long-Term ELLS, those who have received six or more years of 
ELL services, but continue to require them. Many of these students have received ENL services 
for more than four years, but have not been able to achieve proficiency on the NYSESLAT nor 
meet the state standards on the NYS ELA and Math assessments. In addition to the I-Ready 
program, the Ready Theory program will also be used as the main instructional program with 
this targeted group. It is an online program that adapts to students’ individual ability levels and 
presents them with thousands of skill building exercises specifically tailored to meet their needs. 
The program consists of a full range of reading levels, beginning with elementary school reading 
and ending with the most demanding college-level passages.  There is no cost for the Read 
Theory program and it is aligned to the NYS learning standards. 
The science sessions will focus on reinforcing key science concepts and skills, using the inquiry 
process through hands on labs to conduct scientific investigations and experiments and helping 
students better prepare for both the NYC science performance tasks and NYS science exam. 
       Additional supplemental instructional resources will be utilized to further support all 
learning. Such resources include Khan Academy, IXL Math, Go Math, Finish Line New York 
ELLs , which provides students with question types that parallel those found on the NYSESLAT. 
In addition, Kahoot an online educational tool will be used by teachers to create quizzes in a 
game-like setting where students will use ipads to register their responses. Instructional supplies 
including chart paper, chart stands, folders, markers, notebooks, pencils, etc. will be purchased to 
support the after-school ENL Program. 
        As a special culminating activity and integral part of our instructional program, we will take 
an educational field trip of New York City. As we know, student learning becomes more 
meaningful when embedded in authentic contexts. We will visit famous NYC landmarks such as 
Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty, and Governor’s Island. The trip will provide students with 
firsthand experience related to many aspects of U.S. history that they have been studying, as well 
as add to their cross cultural experience by exploring and appreciating our city’s rich history and 
culture.  
     The rationale for the selection of programs, supplemental resources, and other activities is 
based on the  results of the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, NYS ELA, NYS Math, and NYS Science 
(8th grade) exam scores and our school instructional focus. Students demonstrated a need for 
additional support to further develop advanced literacy skills in the English language as well 
as  support in attaining high academic achievement in math, science, and other content areas in 
order to meet the rigorous NYS learning standards.

Begin description here:            
 
 I.S. 126's Title III Professional Development program will support our English Language 
Learners to further develop their advanced literacies. There will be a focus on making content 
comprehensible for English Language Learners by using instructional supports, building 
academic vocabulary, facilitating student discussion that promotes deeper thinking, aligning 
instruction to the NYS Next Generation Learning Standards, and utilizing data to drive 
instruction. 
Our School-based Professional Development Committee and school administrators have 
developed a plan for ongoing professional development during the new scheduled PD block on 
Mondays throughout the entire school year. In addition, off-site support is offered to our staff 
throughout the school year by our Queens North Field Support Center. Since our professional 
development is built into the school scheduled time, it maximizes staff participation and 
significantly minimizes costs to the Title III budget. Title III Teachers will be provided with two 
additional after school training sessions in regards to the implementation and instructional 
programs used in the Title III Program. Each one of these sessions will be one hour long.  
Topics to be presented during these professional development sessions include: 
    -     The CR Part 154 Commissioner's Regulations  of New York State-ENL Mandates 
    -      Analyzing ENL related data as well as state and school assessments and using it to drive 
instruction 
    -  Meeting the Socio-Emotional Needs of the ENL classroom 
    -  The Four Hallmarks of Advanced Literacy   
    -  Designing Instructional Support for ELLs success (ENL strategies/scaffolds) 
     -   Growth Mindset  
     -   The Language Allocation Policy 
    -     Close Reading Strategies 
    -  Employing student's native language and cognates to increase comprehension 
    -   NYSESLAT Preparation/Test Strategies (ELA, Math, Science, NYSESLAT)       
    - Testing Accommodations for ELLs and Former ELLs             

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Based on parents' suggestions via PTA meetings, emails, parent orientations and workshops 
along with NYC DOE parent intiatives, IS 126's Title III program provides English Language 
Learners’ parents with the opportunity to attend informative workshops about the NYS Next 
Generation Learning Standards, academic expectations, the high school application process, our 
College Readiness Program, the Family English Initiative, state assessments, testing 
accommodations, promotional policies for ELLs, community based outreach programs, after 
school programs, adult ESL classes and our data site Pupil Path/IO Classroom (FKA Skedula) 
- Parent workshops will be provided throughout the school year, September-June during the day 
and/or evening to accommodate different schedules and will be ninety minutes long. If 
compatible with most parents, we will try to hold workshops on Wednesdays (Workshop 
Wednesday). There will be at least two formal workshops and each session will be one and a half 
hours long. The evening session cost will be paid for from the Title III budget, whereas the cost 
for the daytime session will incur no expense from the Title III budget. Records of parental 
engagement activities such as sign in sheets, agendas and invitations to parents in 
their preferred languages will be maintained by the Parent Coordinator. 
Parents will be notified of these events through PTA meetings, phone messenger, 
school  website, IO Classroom (Skedula)  email,  PTA meetings, Principal to Parent letter, and 
flyers translated in the home languages represented in our school to the greatest extent possible. 
- The Parent Coordinator, community based organizers, administrators, guidance counselors, 
ENL Coordinator or other pedagogues will facilitate or take part in these parent workshops. 
- Interpreters will be available for parents and materials will be translated in the home languages 
of our school community to the greatest extent possible. 
- Parents will be presented with information pertaining to state and city assessments, testing 
accommodations for ELLs and Former ELLs, promotional criteria,  community based outreach 
programs, after-school programs, adult ESL classes.  
-  The following websites will be shown because they are full of valuable resources particularly 
for parents of ELLs: 
     http://schools.nyc.gov/ParentsFamilies/default.htm

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
  1.  Our teachers incorporate various forms of formative assessments into their daily classroom practices to monitor their 
students’ learning and inform instructional planning. These formative assessments are inclusive of learning targets, entrance 
and exit slips, questioning, discussions, conferencing, close reads, teacher observations, thumbs up/down/in the middle or 
red/yellow/green flip charts, white boards, self and peer evaluations, and text selection and vocabulary quizzes. 
Initial assessments used to gather information on individual students; skills and abilities are the results from the 
2018 NYSESLAT, ELA, and Math assessments, as well as department-wide baseline assessments. For newly enrolled ELLs the 
results from the NYSITELL and Spanish LAB assessments are also used to inform instruction. Interim assessments are used to 
monitor students' progress in specific skills and summative assessments are used to measure the overall academic growth a 
student has made in a given school year. After reviewing the data across all grade levels and content areas, we identified

vocabulary knowledge and critical analysis of a text as areas in need of extra support for our ELL students. Therefore, as a 
school-wide instructional focus we have implemented the teaching of advanced literacies with a focus on discussion to 
build academic language and knowledge. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2. The structures we have in place to support this effort is assessing and monitoring students’ progress daily, teacher grade-
level common planning periods in which student results and shared instructional practices are carefully analyzed, discussed 
and used to make any necessary adjustments in instruction.  Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative 
and summative assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student reflection, tracking 
of, and ownership of learning. We use the Datacation data system to track student progress during the year.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
  3. The summative assessments we use to identify a baseline for individual students are the results of all 2018 state exams 
(ELA, NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, Math, and Science), the Beginning-of-the-Year Test from our English Language Arts program, 
Pearson’s My Perspectives, and grade level NYS Next Generation Learning Standards aligned math problems and science 
questions taken from prior state exams. 
In addition, unit or chapter pre-tests are administered across all the content areas to establish each individual student’s 
skill/knowledge level followed by post unit or chapter tests. 
Teachers analyze results to monitor mastery of the skills taught and to identify trends and patterns to inform instruction and 
improve student achievement. End-of-Year Tests are also administered to measure individual student growth. Identified areas 
of need in ELA were vocabulary/word knowledge and comprehension of both literary and informational texts, and writing 
logical arguments to support their claim using accurate evidence.  In math, areas in need were measurement and data, 
geometry, multiplying and dividing fractions, statistics, algebra, and solving multiple step word problems. 
 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

4. Teachers and administrators analyze the results gathered from the various summative assessments to pinpoint gaps in 
learning and plan for targeted interventions to address these areas. Math, Social Studies, Science, Language Arts, ENL, Special 
Education and Arts teachers will implement the advanced literacy instruction into their curriculum.  Increasing interdisciplinary 
teaching will provide students with opportunities for larger scale interdisciplinary projects that will help to increase 
comprehension and understanding of rigorous text with emphasis on academic vocabulary.  Teachers will continue inter-
visitations showcasing best practices and effective learning strategies. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Not applicable  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 
The success of the program for our ELLs is evaluated using the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) guidelines. 
•     Annual increases in the number or percentage of ELLs making progress in reading, writing, speaking, and listening of the 
English language (as determined by adequate scale score gains made in the combined modalities of the NYSESLAT) 
. Making adequate yearly progress in ELA, Mathematics, and Science 
• Meeting the Title III AMAO 2 target for 2018-2019 
Data obtained from the ELL Data Analysis Tool along with other data sources are used to track the progress of our ELLs and 
help us identify ELLs who are at risk and/or Long-term ELLs in order to provide them with additional targeted interventions. In 
addition, it is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our ELL programs and guide future decision making around our ELL 
programs.

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

7.  Progress monitoring is articulated by school leaders with support from the school-wide data team. All teachers, grade-level 
guidance counselors, and support staff have a weekly grade level common planning period where data is analyzed to identify 
patterns and trends in order to inform or adjust instruction. Best practices to address specific skills are discussed, as well as the 
academic and emotional needs of individual students in order to maximize student success. 
Data is warehoused in Datacation/Skedula by all staff members on a daily or weekly basis in order to communicate student 
strengths and weaknesses with administrators, other staff members, parents/guardians, and students.  
 
The school leadership and teachers are using these results to drive differentiated instruction, focus lesson planning, identify 
ELLs who need supplemental academic intervention services, and plan for professional development that demonstrates 
successful strategies to use with ELLs. Instructional Leads will attend CFN PD and turn key strategies during teacher team 
meetings. 
 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 1. a &b.   We have a Freestanding ENL Program which currently consists of three classes, one on each grade level (6-
8). Classes are heterogeneous and travel together as a group (Block model). Our organizational model is 
departmentalized with ENL teachers providing integrated service as co-teachers in the ELA classes across all grades 6-
8. Our one ENL teacher is dually licensed in ELA and ENL teacher.  
  - Students who scored at Expanding Level and Transitioning Level on the 2017 NYSESLAT will receive 180 minutes of 
ENL integrated instruction per week while in an ENL/ELA and/or other content area class. Either a co-teaching model 
is used, where one teacher is fully certified in ELA or in another content area and the other teacher is a fully certified 
ENL teacher or a dually certified teacher in both ENL and a content area will be utilized. 
  - Students who scored at the Entering or Emerging levels on the 2017 NYSESLAT will receive 360 minutes of ENL 
instruction per week; 180 instructional minutes will be delivered in a Stand-Alone ENL class taught by a fully certified 
ENL teacher. The remaining 180 minutes of instruction will be delivered in an integrated ENL class using a co-teaching 
model where one teacher is fully certified in ELA or another content area and a fully certified ENL teacher or a dually 
certified teacher in both ENL and a content area will be utilized. 
  -Our Commanding Level students will receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL services per week for two additional 
years upon initially attaining a Commanding level on the NYSESLAT. 
All ENL classes, both integrated and stand-alone will provide home language support. 
  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

 Not applicable.   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

 Not applicable.  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

  2.  To ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided, the Assistant Principal of the ENL Department 
along with the ENL Coordinator analyze each individual ELL’s NYSESLAT level to ensure from the very beginning of the school 
year that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to CR Part-154 requirements. 

 Students who scored at the Expanding and Transitioning levels on the 2017 NYSESLAT will receive 180 minutes of ENL 
integrated instruction per week while in an ELA/ENL and/or other content area class. Either a co-teaching model is used, 
where one teacher is fully certified in ELA or another content area and the other teacher is a fully certified ENL teacher or a 
dually certified teacher in both ENL and a content area will be utilized.                  Students who scored on the Entering or 
Emerging levels on the 2017 NYSESLAT will receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week. One hundred and eighty 
instructional minutes will be delivered in a Stand-Alone ENL class taught by a fully certified ENL teacher. The remaining 180 
minutes of instruction will be delivered in an integrated ENL class using a co-teaching model where one teacher is fully 
certified in ELA or another content area and the other is a fully certified ENL teacher or a dually certified teacher in both ENL 
and a content area will be utilized. 
- Students who scored at the Commanding level will receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL services per week for two additional 
years upon initially attaining a Commanding level on the NYSESLAT.  
All ENL classes, both integrated and stand-alone will provide home language support. 
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
3. The program model includes two components: 
   Language Arts instructional component – the Language Arts instructional component is delivered through instruction in 
English Language Arts (ELA) and English as a new language (ENL). 
           Content Area instructional component - the content area instructional component is delivered through instruction in 
English using ESL methodologies and strategies. Scaffolds are always used to assist with learning. 
Instruction is designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, writing, and communicating in English through the 
integration of academic content appropriate for the student’s age, grade level and English language skills. 
  Instructional Methods: 
         All ELL students receive the same rigorous common core standards-based curriculum as monolingual students, and all 
instruction follows the Reader's/ Writer's Workshop model. A literacy-rich school environment immerses students in a variety 
of language experiences where classroom discourse and interactions are well-designed to enable ELLs to develop 
communicative strengths in language arts. In all content areas there is a strong focus on academic language instruction so that 
students can successfully perform CCLS tasks such as citing evidence, persuading, and engaging with complex informational 
and literary texts. Ongoing assessment and feedback guide instruction and learning. To make content comprehensible and 
enrich language development all lessons are inclusive of mini lessons, close reading, annotating text, comprehension checks, 
think/pair share, turn and talks, independent reading/writing journals, interactive reading/writing, graphic organizers, skills 
and guided practice, phonemic awareness, fluency, academic vocabulary and text comprehension strategies. In order to 
challenge our students to use higher order thinking skills, there is a lot of open-ended and leveled questioning using Webb's 
Depth of Knowledge (WDOK), accountable talk, debates, and multi-genre reading and writing performance tasks. Some 
methodologies used to carry out the lessons are collaborative learning, modeling, scaffolding, Total Physical Response (TPR), 
visuals, cognates, native language support, etc. Implementing such practices allows for the development of both basic and 
inter-personal communication skills (BICS) and cognitive academic language proficiency (CALP). 
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  4. To ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native languages, we follow New York State regulations such as: 
  -Newly enrolled students who have Spanish indicated as their home language and do not test out on the NYSITELL, the 
Spanish Lab is administered. 
- NYS testing accommodations for our ELLs and SWDs are always arranged for and alternative language editions of state tests 
are ordered as necessary.  
-Translators for the lower incidence languages that our ELLs speak as well as bilingual dictionaries/and glossaries are always 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

provided.  
     For ELLs that are also identified as having disabilities, the Committee on Special Education (CSE), as per state policy (CR-Part 
154), will develop an individualized education program that considers the language needs of the student as they relate to the 
student’s IEP as well as the special education supports and services a student needs to address his or her disability and to 
support the student’s participation and progress in the general education curriculum.  Any re-evaluation made by the CSE will 
require a bilingual assessment.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

  Differentiated Instruction is always planned for to better meet the learning needs of each individual student. The 
following assessments will be used to differentiate instruction as well as to determine the learning targets and the short-term 
goals for individual students. 
    - NYSESLAT scores     
    - NYSITELL scores    
    - Home Language Identification Surveys (HLIS) 
     - Baseline and Pre-Assessment scores in all content areas  
     - Performance Tasks, Tests, Quizzes   
     - Student Portfolios 
     - The New York State ELA, Math, and Science test scores 
     - Daily Formative Assessments 
     -Teacher Observations & Conferencing Notes 
The instructional plans we have in order to differentiate instruction for our specific ELL subgroups are as follows: 
          SIFE students are immediately identified by reviewing the responses on the HLIS form and SIFE questionnaire. The results 
from The Multilingual Literacy SIFE (MIL) Screener are used to determine if a student had an  interrupted/inconsistent formal 
education. 
          For newly enrolled ELLs, the Home Language Survey (HLIS) is used. These students are placed in an age appropriate class 
and the ENL Coordinator informs their teachers of the student's ENL level so that they have a better understanding of the 
child's English capabilities. Next, they are assessed in both literacy and math skills in order to determine their academic 
abilities. Assignments and tests are then modified, as well as testing accommodations given to meet their particular learning 
needs in order to help them achieve academic success. Bilingual content area libraries that are aligned to grade specific 
curriculum are used to support learning. Students will receive academic intervention services in a smaller group setting during 
the school day which will focus on literacy and math skills. They will also be highly encouraged to participate in our Title III 
after-school program and given an application in their parent's preferred language. We are strengthening our instructional 
core by fostering advanced literacy skills such as writing, debating, and discussing as tools for reinforcing language 
development and knowledge acquisition. Our goal is to provide these students with the support necessary to have them 
“catch up” to grade level. Diagnostic reading and writing assessments will be ongoing and reviewed collaboratively by the 
students' Language Arts, ENL, and AIS teacher in order to develop a more prescribed plan of intervention.  
            Newcomer ELLs who are in this country three years or less have been placed in an age appropriate Block Class, which 
means the travel together as a group. They receive a minimum of 180 minutes of instruction in an integrated ENL class by a 
fully certified ENL and ELA teacher. If they have a transitioning or lower level on the 2017 NYSESLAT, then they receive an 
additional 180 minutes of stand-alone ENL instruction in a smaller group setting. All other Instruction is departmentalized and 
conducted by fully certified teachers who have received professional development in ENL strategies or by dually licensed 
teachers who hold both an ENL and content area license. There is a focus on using scaffolds, visuals, and graphic organizers to 
support instruction and vocabulary development. Bilingual content area libraries and glossaries that are aligned to grade 
specific curriculum are used to support learning. Since it is required by NCLB, that all ELLs who have been in the U.S. over one 
year take the English Language Arts (ELA) exam we have aligned  instruction in the ENL stand-alone classroom to the ELA 
curriculum. Participation in our Title III after school program is highly encouraged and students are given an application in their 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

parent's preferred language. 
     For our Developing ELLs who have been receiving services for four to six years, we will focus on the development of their 
cognitive academic language proficiency (CALP) and metacognitive skills by utilizing Bloom’s Taxonomy to demonstrate critical 
thinking. Students will work collaboratively on challenging activities which will involve the use of higher order thinking skills. 
Ongoing assessments will be utilized to identify learning targets and plan for intervention strategies that will be utilized to 
address weaknesses. Participation in after-school and Saturday programs is highly encouraged. 
     Our long-term ELLs are usually proficient in listening and speaking but fall short in attaining proficiency in the reading and 
writing modalities on the NYSESLAT. Many of these ELLs have IEPs and it is their learning disability that prevents them from 
being able to achieve proficiency. Instruction for our long-term ELLs focuses on reading comprehension strategies, writing 
skills, and academic vocabulary development.  A Co-teaching model is used in all our ICT and self-contained classes along with 
with additional academic push-in support in order to decrease student to teacher ratio and increase student achievement. The 
2017 NYSESLAT scores, Years of Service Report (RYOS) and ELA Assessments are used to identify these students. Participation 
in after-school and Saturday ANA programs is highly encouraged.  
     Former ELLs are identified using the RLAT report. These students either scored at the Commanding Level on one of the two 
most recent administrations of the NYSESLAT or a level 3 or 4 on the 2017 ELA exam. Former ELLs who have a Level 3 or higher 
on both the state ELA and Math exams are placed in a monolingual grade appropriate class, and if possible, in one composed 
of children who have had similar experiences. These students will all receive two periods/90 minutes of ENL instruction in an 
Integrated ENL class in order to continue receiving support in language development and academic progress. Former ELLs with 
an ELA or Math state score below a level 3 receive 4 periods a week/180 minutes of integrated ENL service, which exceeds the 
instructional time mandated. Instruction is delivered utilizing a co-teaching model composed of both an ELA and ENL teacher 
and students that are monolingual and Expanding level ELLs.  The progress of all former ELLs is monitored and collaboration 
between teachers ensures that the academic needs and social well-being of this particular group of students are being met. 
Any student identified as needing additional academic services is encouraged to participate in after-school and Saturday 
programs as well as our Title III program.  
 Testing accommodations are always provided to all former ELLs as per NYS Testing Accommodations for former ELLs.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 Our ELLs identified as having special needs are always afforded equal access to the same general education curriculum as 
students without disabilities. However,  instruction depends on the students individual educational plan (IEP). All teachers and 
providers who work with these students are given access to the Special Ed. Student Information System (SESIS) where they can 
view a copy of the student's IEP as per the Standard Operations Procedure Manual for Special Education. All teachers work 
collaboratively to implement a rigorous common core standard based learning environment that focuses on academic 
achievement, and language development. Teachers adapt and supplement curriculum when necessary in order to meet 
individual student needs. Lessons are interactively taught using a SMARTBOARD, ipads, and videos along with visual aids, 
graphic organizers, and manipulatives to assist students in learning. Students receive additional push-in services in ELA and 
Math.  
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The goal for our ELLs with disabilities is to afford these students equal access to learn within the least restrictive environment. 
Therefore, to begin with, we created parallel schedules where general education and special education teachers are providing 
instruction in the same content area during the same periods, thus maximizing mobility between settings. All instruction is 
aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and the Integrated Co-Teaching Model (ICT) is used to deliver instruction to 
the majority of these students. The general education content area teachers,  special ed. teachers, related service providers, 
inclusive of the ENL teacher and guidance counselor, IEP teacher and School Based Support Team, all work together to provide 
the recommended services, accommodations, modifications, and support in accordance with students' IEPs. Student 
performance is continuously measured and used to differentiate instruction as needed. There is a strong emphasis on using 
technology to foster literacy acquisition and it has proved to be very successful.     
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
  Our targeted intervention programs supplement regular class instruction during and after the school day, as well as Saturday 
during the fall and spring. All students that received a Level 1 or 2 on the NYS 2017 ELA Exam will be provided with AIS 
services. All promotion in doubt students will also be targeted for AIS services. 
Interventions During the School Day:  
-   City Year Program - instructors from diverse backgrounds with college degrees provide calendars Push-in services in 
Language Arts and Math classes. In addition to the academic component, they work to improve attendance and/or behavior 
skills for students in need of this support. Many City Year instructors are bilingual and can offer home language support to 
many of our students.Theses services are conducted Mondays-Thursdays from 7:30-5:45 PM. 
- Extra ELA Instruction – Students are programmed with three additional periods per week (45 min. per period) in ELA. 
Pearson's My Perspectives is used for ELA instruction, which is fully aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and is 
research-based.  Every unit consists of multi-genre reading selections and a guiding essential question. There is a focus on both 
academic and content related vocabulary. In addition, there is an audio/video component which is utilized throughout lessons 
using Smartboard technology, and native language support in Spanish, Arabic for every selection.  
      - Extra Math Instruction – Students are programmed with three additional periods per week (45 min. per period) in Math. 
The Connected Mathematics Project 3 (CMP3) program is used for core instruction and Go Math is used as a supplemental 
resource support. Both programs are fully aligned to the Common Core Standards and the CMP3 program was selected to be 
used in grades 6-8 throughout the entire New York Ci. and is fully aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. Both 
programs are designed to help students develop an understanding of important mathematical concepts, skills, procedures, and 
ways of thinking and reasoning, in number, geometry, measurement, algebra, probability, and statistics. Go Math can be 
accessed at home or anywhere else there is the Internet. It contains highly engaging tutorial videos which give students step-
by-step instructions and explanations of key math concepts. 
-       Teaching Advanced Literacy Skills- to strengthen the instructional core and improve student learning outcomes. 
-      Interdisciplinary Projects-  to help students make interdisciplinary and real world connections with emphasis on academic 
vocabulary. 
-      College Access for ALL - a NYC DOE program to build a school-wide college and career culture  
 -     Chronic Absentee Program- Guidance counselors meet weekly with students identified as having been chronically absent 
or late. Strategies and action plans to be implemented are discussed. In addition, the Chronic Absentee Program Committee 
meets monthly with parents to inform them of their child’s progress and discuss strategies that may help. Personnel from 
various community outreach services are also present to offer parents information about the support programs available to 
them. 
  
     After School Intervention Programs: 
      - Achieve Now Academy - will be implemented on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays in the fall and spring in order to 
prepare our students in ELA and Math for the upcoming 2018 NYS exams.  
      -Title III after school program- consists of two classes; one targeting the English literacy needs of ELLs and ELLs with 
disabilities who have been in the U.S. for three years and have a NYSESLAT score of Entering or Emerging, the second class is 
composed of ELLS who have been in the US for 4 or more years and have a NYSESLAT score of Transitioning or Expanding  I-
Ready which is a web-based program is used for the main literacy program.   
-      YMCA- This program has an open enrollment and services our students every day from 2:20 - 5:30In the first session of the 
program, students receive small group tutoring or homework help and in the second session students choose from a variety of 
extracurricular activities to participate in. These activities include Creative Writing, Mad Science, Rhymes & Poetry, Flag 
Football, Arts- & Crafts, Dance, and Leadership Team. The majority of the YMCA instructors come from diverse backgrounds 
and speak a second language, therefore they are able to provide many of our students with home language support and are 
more responsive to the cultural needs of our students. 
-     City Year- This program has an open enrollment and services our students Monday-Thursday from 2:20-5:45. Students 
receive small group tutoring or homework help. They also help identified students in improving their behavioral skills. Many of 
the City Year volunteers come from diverse backgrounds and speak a second language, therefore, can often provide students 
with home language support.

Some new programs we will be implementing this coming school year are: 
- Restorative Justice- used to help decrease the number suspension rates 
- Brain Power- used to increase emotional well-being, focus, and team building 
- CS4ALL- 6th-grade students will be provided with a computer science learning experience 
- Pearson's My Perspectives Literacy Program- a multi-genre literacy program that provides learning experiences that promote 
higher achievement and develop the competencies needed for college and career readiness.   
- Go Math- used to supplement the Connected Mathematics Project 3 (CMP3). It can be accessed anywhere outside of school 
where there is internet and provides engaging video tutorials for students in need of additional or an alternative approach to 
instruction. Parents are also given access to the program and to reports which identify their child's strengths and weaknesses. 
 
Improvements we are making consist of: 
 -The implementation of Advanced Literacy across the content areas 
- ELA teachers will only be given one grade level to teach 
- Further applying the theory of Growth Mindset in our instructional practices

11.  All ELLs are afforded complete and equal access to all school programs and receive all city and state-mandated services 
that they are entitled to. All instruction is grade appropriate, rigorous, and aligned to the common core learning standards. 
Students identified as being at risk because they scored a level 1 or low 2 on the state ELA and/or math test, as well  as all 
newly arrived ELLs receive supplemental academic services as well as enrichment activities both during the school day and 
after school through the following programs: 
 - City Year 
- Title III  
- YMCA  
- Achieve Now Academy (ANA) - which offers NYS ELA and Math Test Prep 
- St. John's Gear UP for our 8  th   graders 
- Specialized High School Test Prep 
- Soccer Team 
-Basketball Team 
-Debate Team 
-Chess Club 
Our administration works collaboratively with our special program providers to ensure that there are no scheduling conflicts 
and that our ELL students have the opportunity to participate in all school activities while still receiving all mandated services. 
In order to ensure that our ELLs are afforded equal access to these programs, we provide written notices for these programs in 
their native languages to the greatest extent possible.

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 Some instructional materials used include: 
     . Bilingual content glossaries and translation dictionaries 
     •  Leveled classroom libraries in all genres, including content and grade specific core curriculum bilingual libraries 
     • Pearson's My Perspective's Literacy Program (Inclusive of support in Spanish for every reading selection and academic and 
concept glossaries in Arabic, Spanish, and Chinese which are correlated with the academic and concept words focused on in 
each grade level.  
     •  Finish Line New York ELLs: Bilingual Common Core textbooks and Finish Line 2.0 textbooks 
    . A New Beginning - ENL textbook for students in our ENL Stand-Alone classes (Entering & Emerging English proficiency levels 
and SIFE ELLs) 
    - Triumphboards 
   .  Whiteboards 
    .  Chromebooks, iPads, and Laptops 
     . Google Earth, National Geographics videos 
      • Connected Mathematics Project 3(CMP3), Go Math, and teacher created math supplement activities 
      . Access Newcomers - for Newcomer and SIFE ELLs 
      •  Access- American History (7&8 Grade),  American Journey (8th Grade), maps & atlases,  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

13.  We assess our home language support by ensuring that all curriculum materials and instruction incorporate the cultural 
aspects of the students' backgrounds.   Native Language support is delivered in the following ways: 
      - content specific Spanish bilingual libraries that are aligned to our curriculum            
      - our ELA curriculum program is inclusive of native language support for academic and content vocabulary in Spanish, 
Arabic, Bengali, and Chinese 
       - textbooks with a Spanish glossary 
      - translation dictionaries 
      - 6-8 grade content glossaries for ELA, Science, Math, and Social Studies (available in 10 languages from 
NYU            made available on the NYS Dept of Ed website )  
      - language buddies   
      - graphic organizers in the native language 
      - Google Translator 
     - explicit instruction of cognates 
Our ELL teachers, bilingual guidance counselor, paraprofessionals, City Year tutors, counselors, and other staff members speak 
many of the languages representative of our students and encourage multilingualism. Having a classroom environment that is 
socioculturally supportive will allow students to develop linguistically, academically, cognitively and socially.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 14.  All resources and required services support and are aligned to the Common Core State Learning Standards and the grade 
specific core curriculum in all content areas.  All teachers of ELLs utilize curriculum maps and pacing calendars particular to the 
content area they are teaching.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 Although we share our school building with two other schools, one being a suspension site, we currently do not share 
resources. The other schools do not have any students identified as ELLs. If in the future they acquire students in need of ENL 
services, we can coordinate to share an ENL teacher as well as instructional materials used to support their learning needs. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

 

 16. To assist newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year we conduct several orientations to our 
school. In May, our principal visits each of our feeder schools to introduce himself and our school to future incoming sixth 
graders. At this time he invites all fifth graders and their parents to a special orientation to our school. Flyers about the event 
are distributed in many languages. At the orientations students and accompanying parents are introduced to administration 
and sixth grade faculty, informed about differences they will encounter between the elementary school set-up they are 
accustomed to and that of our middle school, view performances or works from our Arts department, watch a video clip of 
special school events, tour the school, and are given the opportunity to meet with sixth grade teachers to discuss instructional 
practices and view artifacts. In-house translators are present during these orientations. In the beginning and throughout the 
school year we conduct ELL Parent Orientations, "Meet the Teacher Night" and a September parent orientation breakfast. 
Throughout the year we hold ELL individual parent meetings, parent workshops, and ongoing ELL Parent Orientations for new 
ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. The ENL and Parent Coordinator, Administrative team, and sixth-grade guidance 
counselor partake in these school orientations and events. The ENL Coordinator conducts all ELL parent orientations. Students' 
individual ENL teacher will conduct the one-on-one ELL meetings. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

 At this time, due to budget constraints, we can not offer a foreign language class to all our students. Currently, all our sixth-
grade students inclusive of our ELLs and Special Education students, receive foreign language instruction in Spanish, two to 
three times a week. In the seventh grade, only the top seventh-grade class receives foreign language instruction in Spanish. If 
our budget increases we plan on hiring another foreign language teacher in order to be able to offer all our students a 
language elective.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Not applicable.  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
  
1.   Our school has formed a professional development committee which consists of the administration, eighth-grade guidance 
counselor, lead teachers, ENL coordinator, special education teacher, and at least one teacher from the different content 
areas. The PD Committee conducts a needs assessment survey in order to determine the areas that teachers, guidance 
counselors, paraprofessionals, and other school related personnel require professional development in. Based on these results 
and CR Part 154.2 mandates that15% of total PD hours for all teachers will be ENL-specific and 50% for ENL and bilingual 
teachers, the PD committee coordinates professional development sessions that are scheduled on every Monday and meet the 
requirements of CR Part 154. Professional development sessions include information that addresses the needs of English 
language learners and students with disabilities. Since our integrated ENL services, as well as our ICT classrooms, use the co-
teaching model, there are PD sessions that focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies, scaffolding, and integrating 
language and content instruction. 
Our Administration along with the PD Committee keep a record of these workshops along with staff members that were in 
attendance.  
Professional development sessions offered to all teachers of ELLs will focus on integrating advanced literacy skills and content 
instruction, making content comprehensible for English language learners, aligning instruction to the common core standards, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

 

using data to drive instruction, and creating a culturally responsive classroom that promotes equity for all students.  
Topics to be covered during these professional development sessions are:          
.        ENL Mandates-Commissioner's Regulation Part 154  
.          Aligning instruction to the Common Core Standards 
.      Integrating language and content instruction 
•          The Language Allocation Policy 
•          ENL Strategies and Best Practices     
-          Valuing Cultural Differences (Presented by St. John's Gear-Up Program) 
-          Promoting and teaching equity in the classroom 
-          De-escalation and mental wellness strategies 
•          Employing student's native language to increase comprehension 
•          Using assessments to differentiate instruction and ELL and Special Ed. testing accommodations 
•          Test Strategies 
                 •           NYSESLAT Preparation    
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 2.  In order to ensure that the professional development requirements of CR Part 154.2 are being met, the PD Committee 
along with administration produce a monthly PD calendar which is distributed to all teachers and all other staff members; the 
calendar enables all staff members to easily track specific PD given and calculate the total hours of all ELL-specific professional 
development. Attendance for all PD sessions given at our school is taken by a member of the administration and then filed in a 
PD binder which is located in the main office for easy access if needed to be reviewed. For any approved PD sessions that a 
staff member attends outside of our school,  confirmation of registration and agendas must be submitted to our payroll 
secretary and then are also filed in the PD binder. The PD binder also helps teachers and paraprofessionals in identifying their 
individual PD activities in order to assure they are meeting NYS PD requirements for maintaining certification.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
1.   In addition to parent-teacher conferences and parent orientation meetings, our school provides the parents of our ELLs the 
opportunity to meet individually with designated staff members in order to inform them of our ELL program goals and discuss 
various aspects of their child's academic progress relating to language development. These individual meetings will be offered 
throughout the school year during our Tuesday Parent Engagement time. The focus of these meetings will be to inform parents 
of the goals of our ELL program, our expectations for students, and language proficiency assessment results. 
The following data will be used in discussing each child's language development:(NYSESLAT, NYSITELL), ELL Periodic 
Assessments, ENL report card grades and any language needs their child may be experiencing in the content areas (academic 
vocabulary/Tier 1,2, or 3 words). Translators will be available during these meetings to the greatest extent possible and the 
DOE telephone interpretation services will be used when needed. Parents will be provided with a data profile sheet for their 
child, which will be used as a tool to guide student-led conferences. Parents and translators will sign in for attendance 
purposes. An Interpretation of any necessary key documents or information will be made available in the parents' preferred 
language to the greatest extent possible. The ENL Coordinator will keep a record of all parents attending.  

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

  2.  Our school provides the parents of our English language learners opportunities throughout the school year to attend 
activities and informative workshops. To help increase parent involvement, these activities and workshops will be provided 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

 

during the day and/or evening to accommodate different schedules. Parents will be notified of these events and activities 
through a monthly Principal to Parent newsletter that will be sent home in the various languages of our parent community, 
informing parents of school events that they can attend.   In addition, we will post a calendar of these events on our school 
website and use our phone messenger system to communicate with parents and update them on school events 
         Surveys will be administered to parents by our Parent Coordinator who will collect them and analyze the results with the 
PTA, and School Leadership Team(SLT) so that all topics for workshops will be driven by parent interest and need. Parental 
attendance at workshops will be encouraged with raffles and prizes. Bilingual staff and parent volunteers, as well as 
interpreters, contracted from the DOE and Translation Unit will be utilized during these workshops to decrease the language 
barrier and improve communication between the school and our parents. 
             -St. John's University's Gear Up Program is establishing a Parent Action Committee (PAC) designed to provide parents 
with many different services and tools to help them support their child's academic lives. 
Their upcoming workshops include: 
  - in November  - High school transition and selection 
  - in December   - Supporting your child through early adolescence 
  - In January  - Middle School Academic Success 
  - in February- Planning for College 
  - in May - 8th-grade students and their parents, as well as their teachers, will take a trip to tour St. John's           University 
Many other activities hosted by St. John's University are also in the process of being confirmed. 
 Attendance at PTA meetings will be encouraged through Student Awards Ceremonies, raffles, and refreshments.   
         -We will continue to implement Skedula/Pupil Path, which is an online resource for parents. All parents will be able to log 
in and see their child’s progress in all subject areas, assignments posted by teachers, attendance, and latenesses, as well as 
anecdotal reports,  which the program is able to translate when requested. 
         Our school will further encourage school-level parental engagement by:  
• holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference 
-implementing an annual school wide multicultural fair along with a student talent show 
. planning educational trips to take place throughout the year. (Venues will include: The Hall of Science, Museum visits 
(MOMA), Socrates Park, Lincoln Center, and Broadway Performances. Statue of Liberty, and other famous NY landmarks) 
 • hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year 
 • encouraging meaningful parent participation in the School Leadership Team, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee 
 • supporting or hosting Family Day events 
 • establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; offering instructional materials for parents 
 • hosting events to support men asserting leadership in education for their children 
 • encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers 
 • providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their children’s 
progress 
 • providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home  
 . conducting a workshop on: the common core standards, student expectations, and NYC school discipline code, all 
statewide assessments  
. parents will be shown the following websites to help them view sample common core ELA and Math questions: 
https://www.engageny.org/.../new-york-state-common-core-sample-quest.  and www.nysedregents.org, as well as test prep 
sites such as www.internet4classrooms.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Alexander Angueira, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The data and methodologies used to assess our school's written translation and oral presentation needs consist of 
the following: 

- Parent Preferred Language forms- which asks parents in what language they prefer to receive all written and oral 
correspondence 

- Student Registration Form – at this time an informal interview helps us determine the language needs of the 
parents

information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)

Special Education Committee parents will be informed of their rights to language assistance services. 

  

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We will distribute parent surveys about the availability and quality of translated materials and interpretation services 
received. The Language Access Coordinator will review these surveys in order to evaluate the quality of the language 
assistance we provided to our parents. These findings will be shared with school leaders, the ENL Coordinator, and 
staff members. In addition, we will share these findings with the language and interpretation unit as well as any 
outside vendor we may have used.  

These findings are used to identify successful practices we have in place and need to continue as well identifying 
those areas we can improve upon in order to increase support to parents in need of language services.
