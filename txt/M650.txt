Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Cascades High School provides opportunities for students who have struggled to reach their full potential in other 
academic settings. Our primary mission is to assist “at-risk” students in earning their high school diploma by providing 
flexible programming that allows them to meet graduation requirements at an accelerated pace. Through rigorous 
and culturally relevant academic classes, students will improve upon the skills they need to be independent learners 
who can be successful in both college and the workplace. Through a system of Youth Advocates, Faculty Advisors, and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Peer Leaders, students will have access to multiple layers of support to assist them as they continue to grow into 
respectful, self-reliant, caring, and productive citizens. Through internship placements, career-focused classroom 
lessons, and job shadowing, students will be given opportunities to explore career options and establish connections 
that will serve them beyond their high school years. Parents will serve as positive, supportive members of the school 
community who work with school personnel to improve the culture and climate of the school. 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Cascades High School was established in 1999 as an Alternative, Transfer high school for “at risk and over age / under 
credited” students between the ages of 17 and 20 who have obtained at least 15 credits. Over time, the student body 
at Cascades has changed, now accepting high school students of any age and credit accumulation who have fallen 
behind in school. It is located on the third and fourth floors of a building situated on the Lower East Side of 
Manhattan, adjacent to the Chinatown community. Our diverse student body is drawn to Cascades High School for a 
wide-variety of reasons. The shared commonality between all of our students is that they are over age and under-
credited and want to complete requirements for a high school diploma. 

 

The student body is served by 24 full time professionals and support staff, including one (1) principal, (1) assistant 
principal, (13) teachers, (2) guidance counselors, (1) secretary, (1) computer technician, (1) parent coordinator and (4) 
school aides. Of the 13 teachers on staff, 50% have more than 5 years teaching experience, and 100% hold a Master’s 
Degree. None of the teachers are in their first year of teaching. 

 

Cascades High School has programmed its school schedule to allow for a 9 period school day consisting of 42 minute 
periods. This allows students to maximize additional course offerings through a class schedule that permits students 
to take eight classes per semester in addition to a comprehensive after school program that includes both physical 
courses as well as online classes. In the 2018-2019 school year, a number of grants will allow for the continuation of 
after school programs. The self-funded portion of the after-school program is used to support student progress in the 
credit-bearing on-line classes. Through an Extended School Day/School Violence Prevention (ESD/SVP) grant, 
Cascades is able to offer Music classes through Third Street Music, and a STEM Program, which will include Robotics, 
through Vision Education Media. Counseling in Schools will provide support through the staffing of a social worker 
during the school day on Mondays and Tuesdays. Additionally this grant will provide funding for Cascades' teachers to 
supervise activities such as Homework Club and Fitness Club.  

 

Cascades High School is an approved Title I School Wide Program (SWP) and as such, we offer a wide range of support 
for all our staff and students. Based on a comprehensive needs assessment regarding student achievement and state 
standards, Cascades implements school wide reform strategies designed to provide all students with additional 
support to meet State standards for graduation. The use of Title I SWP funding will be aligned with all New York State 
and New York City guidelines. These funds will be co-mingled with Tax Levy funding to provide direct support services 
to each of our at-risk students. Whenever possible, every effort is made to utilize Title I funds for items other than 
personnel in order to maximize spending power. These funds will allow for the support of instructional initiatives such 
as the following: 

  Online course work that permits students to take courses not typically available in traditional program 

schedules 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

  Use of funds to purchase 2-way Metro cards to support student attendance in weekend programs 
  Use of funds to provide meals for students during weekend events 
  Use of funds for student incentives to improve participation in events supporting an increase in credit 

accumulation 

  Purchase school supplies for students to ensure every student is adequately equipped to engage in the 

classroom 

  Maintain and update classroom technology so each student has access to 21st century learning tools in every 

classroom 

Using our funds in this manner allows our school to take the neediest students, those identified as over age and under 
credited, or those at risk of dropping out of high school, and upgrade an entire educational program so that we can 
improve the academic achievement of all our students. Since each of our transfer students has experienced the 
“Lowest Achieving” category in prior school(s), we are comfortable to note that each of our efforts is designed to 
affect change among the neediest of students. Through the use of such funding plans we can provide this supportive 
education to those students who are identified as having a learning disability, students in temporary housing and 
English Language Learners. We are proud to make note that our individualized approach to schooling and our 
collaboratively based school-wide plans ensure that our educational programs meet the individual needs of each 
learner at Cascades. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Cascades has a small population of both Special Education and English as a New Language students. Cascades offers 
SETTS classes to accommodate the 32 SpEd students on register requiring those services. The Special Education 
coordinator also works closely with the teaching staff, providing PD and one-on-one support, to modify lessons and 
materials to provide access points for students.  

Cascades currently has 7 ENL students on register. While the majority of ENL students are Transitioning or Expanding 
and require only core-content integrated courses, the admittance of Emerging students has required the opening of a 
standalone ESL course. The loss of a dual certified ENL/ELA teacher had led Cascades to return to the push-in model in 
2017-2018. For the 2018-2019 school year, the Art/ENL teacher will push in to senior level English classes to support 
language development. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Over the last year our school has made the most progress in the Effective School Leadership category. Over the last 
two years the Administration worked diligently to improve feelings of trust and create increased opportunities for 
teacher leaders. Administration and the Teacher Leaders worked together to develop the leadership capacity of other 
faculty, encouraging them to share their talents and lead professional development. Early School Quality results for 
the 2017-18 school year show that 83% of teachers responded positively to questions regarding collaboration, with 
93% reporting they talk to other teachers about instruction. All teachers agree that they are provided with 
opportunities to work productively with colleagues and that administration collaborates with them to make sure the 
school runs smoothly. 

Our area for focus continues to be Rigorous Instruction. Pedagogy, with a specific focus on rigor, was identified as a 
developing area in both the 2014-2015 and 2016-2017 Quality Re view's. Early School Quality results for the 2017-18 
school year show only a 70% positive rating in responses regarding Rigorous Instruction. Only 55% of students, and 
57% of teachers, report that students feel challenged in their classes. This is unacceptable. While some teachers are 
providing high-quality instruction that requires students to apply knowledge, others have struggled with aligning 
instruction to Common Core Standards and to the expectations outlined in the Danielson rubric. It is the belief of 
administration and the teaching staff that when students are provided with challenging work that aligns with real-
world applications, they will become more engaged and attentive. Through coaching and curriculum/lesson

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

Cascades High School’s distinctive quality resides in its personal approach to each child’s education. Our success rests 
in our ability to individualize our graduation plans and thus, “backward plan” academic and social /emotional 
programs for every student. We meet with each student on a one-to-one basis and provide them with the support, 
instruction and encouragement necessary to meet high school graduation requirements and begin successful post 
high school programs or employment opportunities. 

Most students enter Cascades having experienced a traditional educational experience in a comprehensive school. 
They arrive looking for a learning environment that can provide individual support, quality education and cooperative 
academic programming. Cascades High School provides just that. We are proud to embody the principles of the youth 
development initiative and do so within a rigorous Regents and Common Core-aligned curriculum. What distinguishes 
Cascades from other schools is evidenced in the principles, which underpin our educational policies and practices. The 
Youth Development Initiative Principles are: Challenge Every Child Academically, Believe Every Child Can Do Well, 
Develop Student Efficacy, and Stand With and Support Every Child Unconditionally. In the Spring semester of the 
2015-2016 school year, an intake interview was developed and implemented. When students arrive to complete the 
intake process, they are interviewed by either an administrator or guidance counselor. The interview allows the 
student to be matched with the necessary support services from the day they enter Cascades. These processes will 
continue in order to ensure that all students’ needs are being met by the school. With the addition of a second 
guidance counselor in the 2016-2017 school year, we have continued to improve our intake process and the matching 
of needed services. The Spring of 2018 saw the creation of an intake committee and application to better align 
applicants with the proper personnel and support from the point they arrive for intake. 

 

Our collective vision is to develop a school in which every child is supported, taught, academically challenged and 
prepared for the world beyond high school. In essence to treat each of our students as if they were our own children. 

 

A review of our past school report cards, progress reports and Quality Reviews indicate a need for the Cascades 
community to establish a more effective system to help implement a consistent level of academic rigor and student 
engagement within every classroom. The 2017 Quality Review rated Cascades as Developing in the area of Pedagogy, 
indicating that rigorous instruction was being provided unevenly across the classes. This system must consistently 
look at the alignment of rigorous classroom practices with Common Core Standards through curriculum reviews, unit 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

planning reviews, inter-visitation of instructional lessons and periodic reviews of student work and progress to ensure 
that our school’s learning outcomes are elevated to a more appropriate level. (1.1) Findings from the 2017 Quality 
Review indicated that rigorous instruction was implemented unevenly across the classrooms. Early data from the 
School Quality Snapshot for 2017-2018 reflects that 85% of students agreed that their classes make them think 
critically, down from 91% the previous year, and 84% of students report that teachers want them to become better 
thinkers..  

 

We have assessed ourselves and had both peer reviews and a School Quality Review that noted our accomplishments 
which have cited the following: 

  All teachers engage in inquiry-based, structured professional development collaborations, through which they 

 

have collaboratively worked to refine and revise curricula and academic tasks which have been aligned with 
the Common Core Learning Standards and to the school’s instructional focus on argumentative writing. 
School leaders provide clear and collaborative leadership in implementing curriculum and aligning available 
resources with the school’s instructional goals so that students’ needs are addressed and learning is 
optimized. (1.3) 

Additionally, the School Quality Snapshot shows that 83% of teachers responded positively to questions about 
Collaborative Teachers. While 80% of teachers felt that they worked together to design instructional programs and 
had opportunities to work productively with colleagues in the school, 93% reported they talked to other teachers 
about instruction. As the faculty continues to work collaboratively to review instructional practice, systems of peer 
evaluation will focus on the even implementation of rigorous coursework. 

School leaders have developed the school program based upon needs identified through data analysis. As a result of 
effective planning and analysis, the school offers an instructional program that meets the needs of the students. 
Course offerings, the school schedule, the length of the school day, the length of instructional periods and support 
programs such as Peer, Faculty and Youth Advocate advisories are all designed to optimize student learning through 
the support of caring and professional adults. Additionally school leaders strategically use resources to make 
technology accessible for all students by providing computers and interactive White Boards in every classroom. (1.3a) 

  The school administration and teacher leaders use a variety of formative and summative data to develop a 
clear picture of student performance and needs at Cascades. The staff and faculty had to develop common 
performance based assessments in each of the core content areas to help monitor and assess student 
performance as it relates to the instructional focus of the school. (2.2) In the 2016-2017 school year, a pre-
assessment was given in the Fall before deciding to redesign the assessments. In the Spring semester, pre and 
post assessments were given. Assessments utilized standards-based grading to identify where students fall in 
relation for the core skills needed in a course. The 2017-2018 school year saw the English and History 
Departments implement pre, mid, and post-assessments each semester. The Math and Science Teams 
revamped their assessments after the first semester. 

The school uses a wide variety of data sources to inform decision making. Formative assessments from the NYC 
Performance Series, teacher-developed assessments, commercially scanned assessments, writing assignments, and 
scholarship marks provide information about student performance. Internal data reports from a school developed 
data system, summative data from Regents, and credit accumulation reports also provide a clear picture of student 
trends and needs. As a result, programmatic changes - such as when and how much credit accumulation is needed - 
optimize student-learning opportunities. (2.2a,b)  

  The school leaders have an effective system of monitoring teacher practice with a clear focus on improving 
student performance. (4.1) School leaders observe teachers both formally and informally according to the 
Danielson framework established through collaborative bargaining with the UFT. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15

 

In the Spring of 2015-2016 the new administrative team implemented a coaching period, where no-stakes 
observations were conducted to highlight areas for focus among the teaching staff. This allowed teachers to 
address areas of weakness early in the semester and before an official observation was conducted. 
Observations provide teachers with data-informed performance feedback with clear next steps to implement. 
In turn, areas in teaching practice that require improvement have been more precisely identified and the 
quality of instructional lessons continues to improve, as such so does student learning outcomes. (4.1a) 
School leaders provide teachers with time to participate in "Grand Rounds" a form of differentiated 
professional development. Instructional rounds and inter-visitations allow for teachers to improve practice 
and maximize student-learning opportunities. (4.1c) 

As part of the Transfer School Institute, Cascades was assigned a consultant from re-Design who observed teacher 
practice in the Humanties Department and supported their development. The consultant found that while all teachers 
were implementing the Common Core Standards and adjusting teaching based on assessment results, these changes 
were happening unevenly across the departments. For the 2018-2019 year, the consultant will work with an 
expanded group of teachers.  

Within this needs assessment we have identified areas in which the school continues to work to improve. Those areas 
include: 

  Although inquiry teams are working on curriculum mapping and have established exemplary maps for subject 

 

areas, greater attention needs to be placed on aligning these maps with the Common Core Standards and 
developing a more comprehensive system to tune, observe and adjust instruction so that the levels in every 
classroom meet the requirements of the Common Core Learning Standards. (1.1b) 
Strengthening Cascades High School's ability to provide access or entry points in every lesson to meet the 
needs of diverse learners is a concern. Although a majority of our lessons have purposeful groupings that 
challenge students and accommodate different learning styles, more must be done to consistently provide for 
differentiation in every room and within every lesson. (1.2) As cited in a recent review of the school, “There is 
evidence of grouping and differentiation in most classes, however, the use of differentiated instruction is not 
yet an embedded practice in all classrooms throughout the school. Some teachers give the same class work to 
the entire class, which results in missed opportunities for some students to make progress.” (1.2b) With the 
utilization of an English as a New Language teacher, who is also certified in Art, as well as the continuation of 
a dual-certified Special Education and History teacher, we hope to continue to improve collaboration between 
teachers to provide meaningful scaffolds and access points.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June of 2019, Cascades High School will ensure that every lesson identifies a single, rigorous, skill-based learning 
objective that is aligned with both a daily and unit assessment that evaluate progress towards mastery. This will be 
evidence by a 15% increase in teachers earning an overall rating of Effective or better in ADVANCE in 1E and 3D.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other 
high-need student subgroups (e.g., 
overage/under-credited, SIFE, STH). 

Teacher professional development time on Mondays will 
focus on examining teacher and student practice aligned 
with teacher-created curriculum maps. Maps have been 
created in Google Docs, allowing for an on-going process of 
peer and administration evaluation and reflection. Skills 
will be mapped across the content areas to ensure both 
vertical and horizontal skill alignment. 

Teacher teams meet to review student work using the 
"Looking at Student Work" protocol, to align the work with 
CCLS and to hold lessons accountable for access points 
(differentiation) as well as level of appropriate high school 
rigor. 

Teacher teams will meet to "tune" teacher plans to ensure 
alignment with CCLS , incorporation of access points, as 
well as the inclusion of rigorous activities. Through the use 
of protocols, such as the "Tuning Protocol: Examining Adult 
Work", teams will meet to look at alignment of current 
instructional work and products to determine the level of 
complexity involved in the instructional classroom activities 
and assignments. 

Teacher teams and whole school faculty teams will conduct 
lesson inter-visitation observations (Grand Rounds) no less 
than ten times this school year to collect evidence and 
provide feedback to teachers on levels of rigor, lesson 
complexity, differentiation and alignment of lesson with 
CCLS as well as alignment with the instructional foci of the 
school in writing, speaking and reading.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Cascades will continue to offer parent workshops that make connections between the Common Core Standards and 
what it means to be college ready. Our goal is to increase the number of students graduating college-ready in Math 
and English. As we provide information to parents regarding college expectations, we explain alignment with 
Cascades instructional expectations. Beyond workshops, we will share information in monthly newsletters regarding 
important assessment dates, to ensure all students participate in benchmarks, while also sharing school-wide results 
with regards to progress. Additionally, the school web site will include suggestions and activities for encouraging 
critical thinking among students. The Parent Coordinator will survey parents regarding workshop interests and plan 
accordingly with administration and CAMBA, the school CBO. The first workshop of the year, to be held September 
12th, will recognize students already deemed college-ready while discussing with parents the ways students can 
become college-ready. During our Back to School Night on October 11th, teachers will be able to address first marking 
period progress as well as student performance on the department pre-assessment, with progress to be discussed at 
future conferences.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

A review of our previous school year’s report card, progress reports, Quality Reviews and learning environment survey 
indicate that our school consistently addresses and works diligently to promote a supportive learning environment for 
students. Described in our School Quality Reviews feedback session most recently as “a community of caring adults 
who push students to be successful”, Cascades High School can proudly boast its strong commitment to providing a 
supportive environment for students. The 2017-2018 School Quality Snapshot indicated that 93% of students feel safe 
in the hallways, bathrooms, locker rooms, and cafeteria, the same as the previous year. 

Yet, despite strong marks within this area, we at Cascades recognize that our transfer school needs to broaden its 
inclusion and support of every student within one or more of its school advisory programs. Cascades began utilizing 
an intake interview process that allows us to match students with needed supports from day one. The 2017-2018 
School Quality report found that 72% of students said their teachers support them when they are upset, up from only 
57% of students the previous year. It is important to note that 93% of students feel there is at least one adult they can 
confide in, but we aim to reach 100% in that area. What is more concerning is our attendance data. Year to date 
attendance is at 61.7%, down 3.2% from last year. School Survey results show that only 65% of students say that most 
students feel it is important to come to school everyday. We feel it is necessary to provide a more supportive 
environment, where students feel loved, supported, and respected in every classroom by every adult.  

Cascades must continue to push and assess itself each semester so that we may maintain a highly effective 
environment of support and be aware of the ever changing needs of students who arrive to our school through an 
open enrollment policy that begins in July and does not end until June. Based on conversations and reviews specific to 
environment, we have established the need to focus this upcoming year’s work on the following: 

  Developing and supporting all school staff and faculty who provide a clear and supportive role for students so 

that they may make resources more readily available for students and foster a community that combines 
social support with expectations of high academic rigor. This support will focus specifically on helping 
students make the academic progress needed to meet their college and career goals. 

  Provide professional development opportunities that focus on social-emotional development as well as 

recognizing bias and the impact on teaching/learning 

  Providing a Champions Program so each student is paired with a faculty member to coordinate support and 

communication from the day of enrollment

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

By June of 2019, Cascades High School will have implemented its Cascades Champions program in which every 
student will be paired with a teacher who will be the first point of contact for support and outreach. This will be 
evidenced by an average yearly increase in credit accumulation by 1 credit.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
This year Cascades hopes to utilize both a Peer Mediation program and parent support groups to help parents better 
support their children at home. Our September 12th parent meeting will include an overview of all support programs 
that Cascades offers, providing key contacts when parents need support. As the Peer Mediation group develops, 
possibly working closely with Student Government, we will offer student-led workshops for parents. Monthly student-
created newsletters will provide information and strategies for behavioral and emotional support.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

A review of our previous school year’s report card, progress reports, Quality Reviews and learning environment survey 
indicates that our school consistently addresses and works diligently to promote a supportive learning environment 
for students. Described most recently as “a community of caring adults who push us to be successful” by students in a 
meeting with the School Quality Reviewer, the statement is a strong indication of support for the work that each staff 
and faculty member performs daily at Cascades.  

All teachers at Cascades have been found to be engaged in inquiry-based, structured professional development 
collaborations through which they have collaboratively worked to refine and revise curricula and academic tasks 
which have been aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards and to the school’s Instructional focus on 
argumentative writing.  

Yet, despite strong marks within this area, we at Cascades continue to push and assess ourselves so that we may 
maintain a highly effective environment built on the professionalism of teacher collaboration and effective teacher 
teams. While past years have developed cross-content teacher teams, a needs assessment has found that teachers 
would feel better supported working in department based teams. The Master schedule has been designed to allow for 
common planning time for Humanities teachers and another for STEM teachers. This will support better cross-
department collaboration. While teacher teams will continue to conduct intervisitations across the content areas, the 
main focus of their work will be within their own departments. Teacher teams will work to ensure that skill 
development is aligned within each department to better support the academic development of our students. The 
2016-2017 School Quality Snapshot indicated that 88% of teachers said that they felt responsible that all students 
learned, a 4% decrease from the previous year. It is the hope that as departments work together to ensure all courses 
are supporting essential skill development through the processes of mapping, tuning, and intervisitations, that the 
faculty will feel more responsibility for student success. in 2016-2017 departments began the process of providing 
skill-based pre and post assessments. They analyzed the data collected to determine where students fell in regards to 
achieving mastery of CCLS. As they analyzed results, they adjusted instruction and implemented department-wide 
practices. In 2017 - 2018 the English and History Departments gave a pre- mid, and post-assessment each semester. 
The Math and Science Departments worked to revamp their assessments in the Spring semester. Additionally, they 
worked to create student-centered rubrics, aligned with the standards, to evaluate progress. With the addition of an 
Assistant Principal with a background in Math and Science, leadership of those departments has fallen to the AP while 
capacity is developed among those teachers. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified

priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
 

By June of 2019, teachers at Cascades High School will engage in either STEM or Humanities team inquiry work to 
implement questioning and discussion protocols and analyze results. This will be evidence by a 15% increase in teachers 
earning an overall rating of Effective or better in ADVANCE in 3B, as well as an average yearly increase in credit 
accumulation by 1 credit.

Effective school leadership is one of the main components of a highly effective school. In a needs assessment that 
includes a look into the practices of current school leadership, we at Cascades are proud to report that our school has 
established a very cooperative culture of shared professionalism. In the NYC School Survey, 89% of teachers 
responded positively to questions about effective school leadership, with 80% of teachers stating that the principal 
communicated a clear vision for the school.  

In this culture our current administration encourages and builds capacity to promote effective school leadership 
among staff and faculty. The results of this development were evident when a member of the Cascades faculty was 
appointed Interim Acting Assistant Principal mid-way through the 2015-2016 school year with the support of the 
remaining faculty, becoming principal in 2017. What is needed now is time, time to allow our newer teaching staff the 
ability to take part in leadership learning while also gaining invaluable skills that come with experience. The 
administration will work closely to continue to support the development of returning Teacher Leaders, while 
beginning more in-depth work to support the position of two Model Teachers. For our novice teachers, increased 
support is needed to develop their instructional practice as well as to begin to develop their leadership skills. Three 
teachers at Cascades have participated in the NYCDOE Office of Leadership Teacher Leader Programs and the school 
has put those teachers and their leadership skills to good use. Additionally, three members of Cascades faculty hold a 
School Building Leader license and their expertise is used whenever possible.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June of 2019, Cascades High School will have at least 75% of teachers plan and run instruction-based professional 
learning sessions (either whole-group PD or small-group inquiry work) in order to increase ownership over school-wide 
instructional initiatives. This will be evidence by a 15% increase in teachers earning an overall rating of Effective or 
better in ADVANCE in 3C and 4E.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

A comprehensive need assessment was conducted which included feedback from the School Quality Review, the 
School Survey, the Parent Coordinator’s Annual Family Engagement Review and other data sources indicating the 
level of family engagement in the school for the prior school year. Developing strong family-community ties must be 
an area of focus. The 2017-2018 School Quality Snapshot shows that 96% of parents felt that the principal worked to 
create a sense of community and 100% of families said the principal is strongly committed to shared decision making. 
Numbers indicate an interest from our families to support our students as they work to re-engage in school, complete 
their high school diploma requirements and transition into college or work. Unfortunately, only 61% of families say 
they are likely to attend a school event and 65% are likely to attend a regularly scheduled Parent-Teacher Conference. 

A review of the family engagement numbers from the previous school year indicate a very limited number of families 
choose to actually come to the school to meet with teachers and participate in the workshops that they requested. 
Parents indicated the following as reasons they could not attend: lack of transportation, work conflicts, lack of child 
care. To address these issues, Cascades plans to implement a number of changes. Cascades will make an attempt to 
re-engage our families in much of the same way we re-engage our students. Efforts to bring our information to each 
home will include a wider and broader range of workshops, an improved communication system including electronic 
web pages and attendance text messages that will bring student and school information immediately to families’ 
computers and smart phones. If needed, Metro cards will be provided to help parents get to and from Cascades. 
Meetings will be held at various times, rather than sticking to a set date and time, to provide more opportunities for 
engagement. Workshops will be conducted when parents sign-up for electronic monitoring to ensure they understand 
the data being presented to them. Moving forward, all parent engagement activities will be paired with recognition of 
student success. Events during the 2015-2016 school year showed that more parents attended events when students 
were being recognized for some school-related success. By working more closely with families, students will hear the 
same message at home and school, hopefully moving them closer to graduation and future success. Cascades will 
continue to provide parents with a “menu” of possible parent workshops at intake, with areas for them to suggest 
new workshops.

Section 7: Support for Students in Temporary Housing (STH)  

 

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

There are 
currently 
15 
students 
on 
register 
identified 
as STH 
that are 
on 
register. 

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

In partnership with our CBO, CAMBA, we will hold bi-weekly STH meetings. These meetings will allow STH students 
to come together and discuss the challenges they face with other students in similar situations. The STH meetings 
will be supervised by the social worker from CAMBA. Students will be surveyed to find out what specific areas they 
would like to focus on. Past workshops included finding permanent housing, creating a budget, and finding 
childcare. 

Additional check-ins are conducted by the Guidance Department to ensure that all student needs are being met 
both within and outside of the school. Funds are used to provide students with basic supplies, additional 
transportation options (2-way Metro cards), and clothing.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
 

As a point of clarification, based on the BEDS survey and a complete understanding of the 14 teachers currently 
assigned to Cascades High School, every member of the faculty meets the New York State and US Department of 
Education "ESEA"definition of “Highly Qualified.” Maintaining these individuals as teachers for Cascades is founded on 
the principle that teachers are professionals and as such should be an integral part of the decision making process for 
both school policy as well as student progress. Weekly professional development opportunities were planned and 
carried out by Teacher Leaders who determined the focus of PD through the examination of student and teacher 
work. External PD opportunities are shared with teachers based on needs observed through coaching sessions, 
ADVANCE-rated observations, and teacher surveys. When teachers self-identify external PD opportunities, 
participation is always granted when a connection can be made with the current assignment of the teacher. The 
administration at Cascades has made the development of leadership capacity among teachers an integral part of 
teacher development, continuing the use of two Model Teacher positions for the 2018-2019 school year. 

An important aspect of instruction at Cascades requires the expertise of HQ teachers. On-line learning and the 
enhancement of computer based learning opportunities must include only highly qualified professional educators to 
monitor the content, student progress and the development of each student and his or her learning experience. To 
enhance this on-line learning, the school offers support and encouragement to faculty who choose to work with the 
on-line learning community. Student progress data and surveys were reviewed by teachers and teachers experienced 
the course work completed on line prior to deciding to become part of this initiative. Professional Development 
focused on on-line learning and computer based instruction is offered for all the faculty interested. PD workshops are 
provided in-house or after school hours. Coverage and per session money is paid to teachers who qualify. This is done 
through Title I funding set aside for HQ Professional Development.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).

The current ongoing professional development program for our school is focused on the understanding and 
development of Common Core Learning Standards aligned curricula as well as unit plans. This program includes group 
workshops as well as individual learning sessions surrounding the integration of CCLS into the daily work and planning 
of instructional courses and lessons. Teachers will explore the standards, multiple areas of student data, student work 
and teacher course plans. The program will introduce teachers to the best practice use of protocols in looking at 
professional work as well as the detailed examples and workshops provided on the EngageNY website. Teachers will 
work collaboratively and in teams to build leadership capacity and to allow for focused discussion and work in each of 
the high school content areas. Workshops are provided weekly on Monday after school as well as daily during one 
identified PD period per week. Teacher Leaders will be utilized to plan and run daytime and PM professional 
development sessions. ENL and SpEd coordinators will offer monthly professional development to support the needs 
of those populations.

Cascades High School boasts a model program of teacher inclusion and distributive leadership. The faculty is an 
integral part of the decision making process and sits on the School Leadership Team, the administrative cabinet and 
professional development team. Through discussion, the inquiry process, and in survey format, teachers voice their 
opinions and their findings on such instructional topics as proper task and assessment alignment for student inquiry

work and strategic instructional approaches to academic improvement initiatives focused on making our teaching and 
learning experience more effective. Teachers additionally are an integral part of the Measure of Student Learning 
committee through which they examine the best assessment data related to student performance within our 
classrooms and learning community. The small size of Cascades faculty allows for all interested teachers to sit on the 
MOSL committee. Teachers choose and make recommendations regarding data measures to be used when reviewing 
student and teacher work, as well as the professional development programs that they engage in throughout the 
school year. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Cascades HS, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

 

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Cascades High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent 
Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the lementary and Secondary Education Act. 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

Cascades High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), 
is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
1. An initial assessment begins at intake when every student and parent are interviewed as part of our admission process.  An 
admission team consisting of the assistant principal, guidance counselor, special education teacher, parent coordinator, 
English as a second language teacher and general education teacher meet with each student and parent who are seeking 
admission. The assistant principal is responsible for the evaluation and administration of all appropriate intake documents and 
tests such as the home language survey and LAB-R if necessary. An oral interview is conducted with each student.  
The intake team will provide findings from initial data review to all relevant teachers.  When students begin in a new course 
(no matter when they are enrolled) all core-content teachers administer teacher-created department-wide assessments 
aligned to core standards.  Teachers enter results into a shared database, allowing review by all faculty.  Data helps guide 
teams as they align curriculum and implement supports to encourage language acquisition and development.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

The Student Support and Improvement Team meets monthly to review the progress and process of instructing our Special 
Education and English as a New Language students.  Due to the small SpEd and ENL population of the school, as well as overlap 
between the groups, it is ideal to meet regarding these students at the same time.  Monthly the team evaluates the progress 
of every ENL student in terms of classroom grades, iLearn course progress, and department-wide assessments as well as the 
score reports from standardized exams such as the NYSESLAT or Regents (when relevant).  Findings from this meeting are 
disseminated through teacher leaders in weekly meetings and in presentations by the ENL teacher at monthly whole-staff 
PD.   Supports are put into place where necessary and tutoring is made available for every student. Follow-up progress calls to 
homes are completed and translators are used to assure the parent communication is open.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success or ineffectiveness of our ENL program is evaluated based on data that results from assessments made throughout 
the school year.  Initial assessments are done for the start of the year and reviewed in the Individual Planning Conference for 
the ENL teacher and ENL Coordinator.  Teacher-created, department-wide assessments are used to measure student growth 
within the content area.  Assessments are aligned to core standards. This progress data is reviewed in teams at least three 
times a semester.  Similar to a cycle of inquiry Cascades reviews student data, instructional planning and practices, student 
work and standardized exam scores to determine the progress of the ENL program.  The department-wide assessments serve 
as the basis for identifying the need for and justification of all instructional shifts to support ENL students. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The ENL teacher works closely with classroom teachers to modify coursework and provide relevant scaffolding and supports 
for ENL students.  When needed, the ENL teacher is made available to meet with teacher teams to develop curriculum and 
lessons that include best practices for ENL students.  Additionally, the ENL teachers turnkeys all relevant district PD to teachers 
in Monday PD sessions. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Although this is a high school, Cascades uses the data and the RTI resources to build students’ oral language skills by teaching 
specialized vocabulary (and the often-abstract concepts such words represent), as well as the specialized structures of 
language in academic speech and text— often referred to as elements of academic language. Accessing high school textbooks 
demands a knowledge of academic language. Building such conceptual and language skills is essential for ELLs to succeed in 
school.  
Core instruction that promotes oral language development is necessarily rich in both language and content. In these learning 
environments, students have opportunities to learn about, study, and discuss the language of texts. They then use this text-
based content learning in interactive experiences like labs, demonstrations, dramatic plays, and debates that promote 
academic conversation and knowledge building.  
Strategies that promote ELLs’ oral language development must be explicitly planned and incorporated throughout the school 
day. These strategies include, but are not limited to:  
     1.  building background knowledge  
     2.  starting with rich text and big ideas so students encounter and study abstract language and abstract concepts, and learn 
about the world  
     3.  previewing key concepts and challenging vocabulary, as well as reviewing students’ understanding of important points  
     4.  when possible, drawing on and using students’ home languages close, interactive reading strategies  
     5.  front load vocabulary, sentence structures, and concepts  
     6.  ask open-ended questions along the way; engage students in discussion and dialogue about a big idea in the text  
     7.  include relevant multicultural literature as well as multicultural chants, songs, and poems that help to build phonemic 
awareness storytelling using wordless books collaborative discussion and debate  
     8.  devote instructional planning and time to student projects that are discussion-based, including oral presentations and 
debates  
     9.  during discussions, pose open-ended questions and keep the conversation going 
    10.  study words, word parts, and word families as part of the content-based literacy instruction; build words and knowledge 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

at the same time; include a focus on words with multiple meanings  
    11.  include vocabulary learning strategies such as using visual cues, total physical response (TPR; i.e., physically acting out 
new terms), and realia sentence transformations through guided dialogue language frames for speaking and listening jointly 
constructed extended Through Writing for example, co-constructing a written text based on a shared classroom experience  
    12.  connecting writing assignments to content under study; supporting explicit connections to community and content  
  
Writing skills play an increasingly important role in determining students’ school and professional success, but developing 
advanced written language skills can be a particular challenge for ELLs. This challenge is due, in part, to the type and quality of 
writing instruction students receive. In fact, large-scale survey research indicates that many teachers report feeling under-
prepared to effectively teach writing (Gilbert & Graham, 2010; Kiuhara, Graham & Hawken, 2009).  
What does written language instruction look like?  
Whether students already know how to write in their home languages, or whether they are in the early stages of English 
writing development, instruction should be adjusted to refine and expand their competencies, and to help them acquire the 
academic writing skills they need in the content areas. Quality writing instruction during the classroom literacy core should be 
sustained and extended (e.g., developing extended research pieces, essays, and stories), so that it is continually linked to oral 
language and reading instruction.  
Strategies for promoting ELLs’ written language development during the instructional core include the following:  
     1.  connect the ways in which students and their families use literacy at home and in the community (e.g., topics, styles, and 
cultural knowledge) with classroom writing themes  
     2.  provide different types of writing tools in the classroom  
     3.  promote different types of writing purposes, genres, and formats  
     4.  model writing activities using the language experience approach  
     5.  Write students’ dictations about a shared classroom experience. Use the text produced from students’ dictations as the 
basis for refining students’ writing abilities.  
     6.  guide students’ early writing by co-constructing predictable and rhythmic books (e.g., poetry, rhyme, and patterned 
language books)  
     7.  use writing in the service of deep text analysis, perhaps in tandem with literature circles, to interact with students (and 
have students interact with each other) through written communications.  For example, use dialogue journals.  These journals 
are written conversations between the teacher and individual students. Although the purpose of dialogue journals is not to 
correct students’ errors, it is recommended to recast them and use the correct model in your responses as a way to advance 
students’ language proficiency.  
model language structures when jointly writing texts.    
  
With these strategies we can generate books for the classroom library such as modified patterned language books, stories for 
wordless picture books, recipe books, and scripts for readers’ theater.  
teach the writing process (i.e., developing ideas, writing them down, getting feedback, editing, producing the final draft, and 
publishing) 
During the first stages of the process, focus writing instruction on communication and meaning construction, as opposed to 
mechanics and correctness. Many ELLs may struggle with editing their own writings when correctness obscures the expression 
of meaning and the development of complex ideas.  
During the latter stages of the process (i.e., editing, producing the final draft, and publishing) support ELLs as they edit their 
own writings. Try using writing rubrics and the traits model to guide students. Bear in mind, most writing rubrics do not 
account for the bilingual strategies that ELLs often use when they write. Encourage ELLs to focus on conventions (e.g., spelling, 
grammar) as the last step in the editing process.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 What a review of the student scores and data reveal is that students are operating on an intermediate to advanced level with 
a demonstrated lower  score on the writing modality.  This is evident not only on past NYSESLAT scores but also in an item 
analysis of past Regent Exam scores in Global Studies, and on the English Language Exam.  Noticeable are the correlations

among scores received for students on the standardized exams and those scores received in the traditional ELA classes within 
the school.  Additionally, department-wide post-assessments are used to measure growth in each core content area.     
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Cascades teacher schedule includes time set aside to meet in teams and review student data.  All content-area assessment 
data is available to each teacher team and is used to inform instruction.  Teachers have time allocated each week for data 
review and for lesson and curriculum adjustments and alignment.  Additionally, the entire faculty meets every Monday to 
address patterns in student performance and engage in relevant PD to improve instruction and student achievement.  Cabinet 
meetings address findings with school-based stakeholders each week while information is shared with parent representatives 
in monthly School Leadership Team meetings.  One guidance counselor supervises all ENL students and is the point-person for 
disseminating information to parents. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 Cascades uses a freestanding ELL Program.   Our Language Allocation Policy is a school-wide plan designed to address 
our students who require additional support services as they progress toward academic proficiency in English. 
Students are encouraged to write in English through the use of dialogue journals between the teacher and the 
students. Cooperative learning is incorporated into lessons providing students with shared learning opportunities. 
Additionally, students are encouraged to bring their personal experiences in through the use of the Language 
Experience Approach and culture studies projects. Prior knowledge is continuously accessed in class. Academic 
language scaffolding is also applied throughout the lesson's delivery. 
To do so, students are given access to classroom libraries that are categorized by level of proficiency. These libraries 
will continue to be upgraded as our school focuses on the needs of our ELA and ELL students.  Students are 
programmed to ungraded classes by the guidance counselor upon review of the ESL team. Students programs are 
reviewed by the assistant principal. Entering and Emerging students receive 2 periods per day of ESL instruction, one 
stand-alone period and one ENL/ELA integrated course.  Transitional and Expanding students are programmed for one 
period each day of an integrated ENL/ELA course.  Commanding students are programmed for one integrated Art/ENL 
class each day.       

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Entering and Emerging students receive 2 periods per day of ESL instruction, one stand-alone period and one ENL/ELA 
integrated course.  Transitional and Expanding students are programmed for one period each day of an integrated ENL/ELA 
course.  Commanding students are programmed for one integrated Art/ENL class each day.       
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
     Lessons are aligned with state Common Core standards and consist of activities that foster both social and academic 
growth. The language of instruction is currently English. Instructional planning includes language functions, structures, usage 
and vocabulary are part of each lesson. Currently the materials used within the classes consist of texts entitled Visions, 
independent Hi-Lo readers and teacher adapted materials.  
        Our diverse student body, which at the time of this writing consists of 228 students, is drawn from recent immigrants from 
the immediate community as well as students who have chosen to attend Cascades High School after having experienced 
difficulty adjusting to the traditional learning environment found in many large New York City Comprehensive High Schools. 
The shared commonality for all of our students is that they are overage and want to complete the regular high school diploma 
program.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

    Cascades High School is proud to have an individual admissions process during which  a total evaluation of the student is 
completed by a team of instructional experts including the assistant principal, ENL teacher, Special Needs Teacher, Youth 
Advocate, English Language Arts Teacher and Guidance Counselor.  Each student's exam history is reviewed and every student 
must complete a written, oral and listening exam to gain entry and placement within our school.  This admission's conference 
assures us that the student is evaluated properly in both English and their Home Language.      
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 Academic Intervention and Support Services - During each semester the ESL teacher conducts academic support by pushing 
into classrooms or pulling-out ELL students from their normal class program. At these one-on-one tutorial sessions the ENL 
instructor provides valuable support for the student .   
School Spirit and Collaborations – during the traditional school year, the ESL teacher in collaboration with the parent 
coordinator and coordinator of student activities plans for after-school events that celebrate the progress and performance of 
our ELL students. Families are invited to participate and celebrate their child’s education in a program that emphasizes our 
school’s commitment to multi-culturalism.  
Newcomers Plan – Students who arrive at Cascades and are newcomers to either NYC or the United States will be evaluated 
using the LAB-R exam. Results of this exam will be reported to the Department of Education and to the school’s admission 
team. A parent / student interview will be conducted with the parent coordinator, ENL teacher and the guidance counselor. 
Parents will be provided with the same ENL information that was stated above, and will be given the option of choosing the 
most appropriate program for their child.  
Special Needs / ELL - All support and instructional programs available for ELL students and Special Needs students are available 
for students identified as both ELL and Special Needs. Within this program, parents, guidance counselors, related service 
providers, ESL teachers and Special Education teachers collaboratively work toward providing the identified student with the 
instruction and educational support necessary to be successful within the ESL and Regents curriculum. Some strategies include 
academic intervention services, one-on-one tutoring, counseling and collaborations among all content teachers.  
Long Term ELLs and Extension of Services - Although Cascades only had one student listed as in need of extended services, our 
plan is to address these students with specific academic and social support. ELL students in need of extended services will be 
provided with individual counseling from our guidance staff and one-on-one tutorial assistance from both the ESL teacher as 
well as a certified English Language Arts instructor. These services will be provided via a PM school support program.  
Students Achieving Proficiency – English Language Learners who achieve proficiency still require additional support services. 
These students will be monitored by both the ESL teacher and the Guidance Counselor. Additional Academic Intervention 
Services will be supplied both during the regular school day as well as within a comprehensive PM school program. Their

progress academically as well as on standardized state exams will be monitored for accountability and early academic 
intervention.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 Academic Intervention and Support Services - During each semester the ESL teacher conducts academic support by pushing 
into classrooms or pulling-out ELL students from their normal class program. At these one-on-one tutorial sessions the ESL 
instructor provides valuable support for the student . Additionally, ESL classes are provided during the PM school session and 
ELL students are targeted and programmed for these AIS courses by both the ESL teacher and Guidance Counselor.     
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
        Cascades allows for flexible programming of student schedules and on-line learning to allow access for all students.  This 
flexible scheduling allows for students to be able to meet the ESL and IEP goals so that they may experience success in 
completion of high school diploma requirements.  All teachers are available every Tuesday 2:45 to 3:30 for ELL students 
assistance.     
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Intervention services range for ELL students in the aforementioned areas: 
Individual peer tutoring, group peer tutoring, individual teacher assistance, and pull out and push in assistance in English is 
available. 
Content differentiation made for Vocabulary, scaffolding and supports available for all teacher lessons.   
Specific targeted interventions for content areas are as follows: 
Social Studies - The ELL student is mandated to participate in an on-going and individualized AIS program in which individual 
tutoring time with the content area teacher is provided weekly.  Instructional focus is placed on providing supports and 
content in the student's native language these include, vocabulary scaffolding, pre -taught vocabulary lessons, presentation of 
material in the student's home language as provided by an interpreter.  Additional supports include advisory time to meet with 
the ESL teacher for content specific review of material, as well as co-preparation planning time for both the general education 
teacher and the ESL teacher specifically targeting the student's progress and instructional needs.  
Mathematics - The ELL student is mandated to participate in an on-going and individualized AIS program in which individual 
tutoring time with the content area teacher is provided weekly.  Instructional focus is placed on providing basic mathematical 
skills supports and content in the student's native language these include, vocabulary scaffolding, pre-taught vocabulary 
lessons, presentation of material in the student's home langugage as provided by an interpreter.  Additional supports include 
advisory time to meet with the ESL teacher for content specific review of material, as well as co-preparation planning time for 
both the general education teacher and the ESL teacher specifically targeting the student's progress and instructional needs.   
Science -  The ELL student is mandated to participate in an on-going and individualized AIS program in which individual tutoring 
time with the content area teacher is provided weekly.  Instructional focus is placed on providing supports and content in the 
student's native language these include, vocabulary scaffolding, pre-taught vocabulary lessons, presentation of material in the 
student's home language as provided by an interpreter.  Additional supports include advisory time to meet with the ESL 
teacher for content specific review of material, as well as co-preparation planning time for both the general education teacher 
and the ESL teacher specifically targeting the student's progress and instructional needs.      
Teachers employ flexible and fluid grouping structures both homogeneous and heterogeneous, to work with ELLs based on 
English Language proficiency, native language and level of background knowledge.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 Providing individual tutors and paraprofessionals to assist ELL students in note taking and study skills.      
Increase team-based PD on improving ELL performance int he content areas. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 ELL students are not identified as a targeted group within our school, in fact they are infused in every content class and 
activity without exclusion.  ELL students have one faculty advisor and an advocate counselor who assure that they are included 
in every school class, activity and function.  Additionally, the adult advocates are part of the school's Leadership Team and 
responsible for making certain that any and all activities planned by the school consider not only the inclusion of ELL students 
and their families but supports necessary to be in place for the activity to be successful.  ELL students sit on school based 
committees such as the student government organization and are represented on the school leadership 
team.  Representatives of the ELL students are also represented in an ENL and SIT team which meets to look at issues 
surrounding students with disabilities as well as struggling ELL students.       
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 Texts, multiple modality technology such as apple computers, iPads, netbooks. HP desktops and software usable to assist ELL 
students in writing and in understanding vocabulary. iLearn software for on-line learning, as well as Castle Learning for content 
specific review, provides reading and translation support.      
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

  Since we only currently have an ENL model, for TBE and Dual Language students' needs would be met by both school 
programs initiated by the ELL Team and supplemented by the Network and Special Services Coordinator.  As for the ENL 
program, the native language support is provided by both a foreign language teacher, a bilingual guidance counselor, a 
Spanish-speaking ENL teacher and advocate counselors who provide guidance in the student's home language.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 The resources assist students as they progress through the content of high school material.  Supports allow students to spend 
more time in language acquisition and less time concentrating on standardized exams.      
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Collaboration between Cascades High School and Forsythe Satellite Academy has led to the building of a shared school media 
center.  As the year progresses we hope to develop this space into a shared school library.    
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 Summer orientation programs and assimilation programs are used to assist ELL students become familiar and comfortable 
with Cascades High School.  Advocate counselors, guidance counselors, and the parent coordinator conduct ongoing outreach 
and coordinate workshops as requested.     
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish is the only language elective offered at Cascades and is offered to our ENL students.  While many of our ENL students 
are native Spanish speakers, an evaluation of their written language and reading skills has highlighted the benefit in providing 
the Spanish elective.  The Foreign Language teacher differentiates instruction based on the needs of individual students. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61

5.   Ways to get English language learners actively involved in your lessons. 
6.  Using supports to assist ELL students in meeting Common Core Learning Standards. 
  
As our school looks to improve and increase the academic rigor associated with the Common Core Learning Standards the 
professional development plan for Cascades will include supports, workshops and concrete stategies that must be part of 
careful planning to provide lesson access points for all students in particular those identified as ELL students.    
There are regularly scheduled in-house school inquiry meetings in which teachers, support staff and administration 
collaborate. These workshops,  facilitated by ESL and ELA teachers, help all content area teachers develop best practices, and 
strategies. This on going PD incorporates: 1. rubrics; 2. methodologies: and  3. project-based activities. Faculty examines how 
literature and informational text can be scaffolded to support content-based instruction. This supports ELLs in 
accessing  explicitly aligned Common Core Learning Standards; it also adheres to CR Part 154 regulations. 
  
  
•      The in-house inquiry meetings also focus on integrating college- and career-ready standards in reading/language arts and 
mathematics. 
  
•      Teachers incorporate assessment of content-area learning and language development. 
  
Furthermore, the following guiding principles are constantly reviewed with staff: 
  
Principle 1: Instruction leverages ELLs’ native language(s) and cultures.  
  
Principle 2: Instruction develops discipline-specific language along with discipline-specific knowledge and competencies.  
  
Principle 3: Instruction is standards-aligned and grade level appropriate.  
  
Principle 4: Instruction addresses the needs of students with various levels of English proficiency and with a variety of prior 
school experiences.  
  
Principle 5: Instruction provides the necessary support to ensure that ELLs comprehend disciplinary texts and tasks. This will 
enable students to acquire the language and knowledge they need to become more independent learners.  
  
Principle 6: Diagnostic and formative assessments are used to identify students’ knowledge and academic language 
competencies to guide instructional practice.  
  
7. 5 hours for ELL and 10 hours of professional development for Special Education teachers will be provided throughout the 
school year.  These PDs will consist of weekly participation in on-line workshops as well as one full faculty workshop per 
month.  Teachers will participate in these activities throughout the school year maintaining a log of professional development 
that may be submitted to the administration as part of the teacher's artifact collection.  Specific workshops will include ELL and 
Special Needs professional development provided by the Field Support programs as well as via on-line webinars / tutorials via 
systems located online as well as NYSED. In addition to these workshops and learning opportunities, the ESL teacher as well as 
the Special Needs teacher, will provide professional development programs to all faculty members including those non-ESL 
and non-Special Needs teachers on a monthly basis.  Meeting agendas and materials will be maintained by the ESL and Special 
Needs teachers documenting these mandated professional development hours.     
  Common Core Learning Standard alignment is the primary professional work that each of our ESL teachers 
receives.  Additional workshops include but are not limited to those conducted within the Department as well as through 
outside vendors such as Generation Ready.  Currently our ESL teacher attends all relevant workshops offered by the MFSC. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include

 As stated above our professional development time is comprehensive and includes the mandated time requirements for all 
teachers as well as those identified as ESL and Special Needs.  Specifically, 7. 5 hours for ELL and 10 hours of professional 
development for Special Education teachers will be provided throughout the school year.  These PDs will consist of weekly 
participation in on-line workshops as well as one full faculty workshop per month.  Teachers will participate in these activities 
throughout the school year maintaining a log of professional development that may be submitted to the administration as part 
of the teacher's artifact collection.  Specific workshops will include ELL and Special Needs professional development provided 
by the MFSC and contracted professional development programs as well as via on-line webinars / tutorials via online learning 
websites as well as NYSED. In addition to these workshops and learning opportunities, the ESL teacher as well as the Special 
Needs teacher, will provide professional development programs to all faculty members including those non-ESL and non-
Special Needs teachers on a monthly basis.  Meeting agendas and materials will be maintained by the ESL and Special Needs 
teachers documenting these mandated professional development hours.

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
ELL Parent involvement is on par with the parent involvement of our general education parents.  To assist and help improve 
these numbers Cascades is proud to sponsor specific parent focused events for those families of ELL students.  Parent 
programs include Learning English as an Adult, Assisting our child in learning another language, Cultural Evenings.  Legal 
Workshops, College Options and Financial Assistance Workshops.  At every school function, translators are available for all ELL 
parents and students as needed.  Parent meetings are conducted in English and translation services are provided to ELL 
parents via our comprehensive translation services.  Services are provided by both the school as well as through our 
community based partnership with CAMBA.   To ensure we meet parents for an annual review of progress we actually 
schedule and meet with our ELL parents / guardians no less than twice a school year to review their child's progress.  Meeting 
notes and records are all maintained by the guidance counselor in the student's official record file maintain within the 
guidance office.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Monthly parent meetings for ELL students and their parents/guardians include workshops on language acquisition programs 
and skills that can be helpful at home.  Workshops are conducted at monthly ENL parent nights and are part of our outreach 
efforts for every student and his or her family.  Most recently, a workshop was offered to help to inform parents of 
undocumented students of their options for college enrollment and finance.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Ezequiel Garcia, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Every student who applies to attend Cascades High School has an individual interview with a team of school staff 
including administration, guidance, parent coordinator, ESL teacher and Special Needs Coordinator. The pupil 
personnel secretary begins the process by running a report of every ATS, SESIS and Stars report available for the 
applicant to the school. As our students all arrive from high schools in NYC (a condition of the transfer school 
requirement for admission) the process includes a comprehensive review of the student's language abiilities as 
well as the family's home language and language of preference. At the admission conference a review of the HLIS 
and the ATS reports on home languge and language preference are mandatorily conducted. This review of all the 
student's records in paper form and through ATS is performed with the student and his or her parent/guardian. 
Parents / guardians and students declare and identify their home language and their prior status as English 
Language Learners or former English Language Learners during this process. A review of the home language 
survey and that information is conducted. Should a student arrive from outside New York City and or seek to 
enter the NYC Public School System for the first time then appropriate Home Language Surveys and Language 
Assessments are performed and that information is immediately entered into the ATS system. A full listing of all 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

our students and their home languages are maintained in the main office and shared with the entire school 
faculty and staff weekly and upon each new enrollment, as enrollment is "open" to over the counter entries 
during the school year. Since our school is so small each parent / guardian and student's interpretation needs are 
assessed individually and every document, conference and meeting is conducted with the translation needs in 
mind. To make sure this process is maintained throughout the year, the school pupil personnel secretary, the 
assistant principal, the Guidance Counselor and the parent coordinator meet weekly to make sure that all 
translation needs for students and families is maintained. Translators in each of the families home languages are 
available on site in the school daily and every document created is translated into the home languages identified 
for every student. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

staff at the start of each year. The Administrative Team will review Chancellor's Regulation A-663 with all faculty and 
staff at opening professional development on September 4, 2018. Administration will share practices, resources, and 
contacts for translation and interpretation services.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 requires that the DOE provide interpretation services, either at the school/office where 
the parent is seeking assistance or by telephone, to the maximum extent practicable, during regular business hours to 
parents whose primary language is a covered language and who request such services in order to communicate with 
the DOE regarding critical information about their child’s education.  

Cascades is pleased to offer over-the-phone interpretation services during regular business hours in over 150 
languages by utilizing this service provided by the DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit.. To clarify, these services 
are accessed by contacting the T & I Unit but are provided by a contracted vendor. Language identification is done by 
either: 

• A DOE staff person identifying the language 

• The limited English proficient parent identifying their language from a Language Identification Card 

• The vendor identifying the language with the use of specialized linguists over the phone 

Since Regulation A-663 also requires that documents produced by schools which contain critical information regarding 
a child’s education must be translated into the covered languages. Documents containing critical information that are 
translated include, but are not limited to, the following areas: 

• Registration, application and selection 

• Standards and performance 

• Conduct and discipline 

• Safety and health 

• Special education and related services 

• Entitlement to public education or placement in any special education, English language learner or non-standard 
academic program 

• Transfer and discharge 

• Legal or disciplinary matters 

The T & I Unit is responsible for translating the majority of these documents into the covered languages. Translations 
into non-covered languages are obtained from qualified contracted vendors.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72 

 

All of the translation work produced by the T & I Unit is translated by DOE employed translators and go through a 
quality control review before being finalized. DOE translators are aided by translation tools, such as translation 
memory software, bilingual glossaries of DOE terminology, and foreign-language style guides.  

Parent/Guardian and Family Outreach 

Cascades utilizes the T & I Unit's multilingual posters which are posted throughout our school in highly visible 
locations. These posters provide LEP parents instruction on where and how to obtain interpretation services.  

The school makes available to parents the Parents’ Bill of Rights and A Parent’s Guide to Special Education in the 
covered languages. Both documents make parents aware of their rights to languages services. These documents are 
distributed to parents at the beginning of each school year and can also be accessed on the DOE’s website 
(www.schools.nyc.gov).  

To make sure that Cascades is meeting the needs of the families and complying with the Chancellor's Regulations, 
staff take part in various training programs offered by the DOE. These training modules include information on: 

• The school’s role in facilitating the provision of Language Access services 

• Accessing translation and over-the-phone interpretation services from the Translation and Interpretation Unit 

• Obtaining translated signs for posting and Language Identification Cards for identifying parent’s primary language 

• Resources and support available from the T & I unit 

• Accessing school translation funds and options for using these funds 

As with any program, its effectiveness depends on constant and effective monitoring. To ensure this Cascades staff 
monitor our compliance with translation and interpretation services on a weekly basis. This is done to ensure that the 
school and its faculty and staff are communicating effectively with our LEP parents.  

One additional method of measuring how well our school is meeting these needs is a comprehensive review by the 
entire faculty and staff of the NYCDOE School Survey for Parents – This survey made available to all school-aged 
parents to assess their child’s school, includes whether or not the school is communicating with the parent in their 
native language. A review of these findings provides the school with quantitative data that determines if policies and 
or practices need to be adjusted. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Monitoring and Quality Control will be conducted by the administration of the school and the Parent Coordinator. 
Quality Control checks will be performed monthly to assure that proper procedures and protocols are all in place and 
are used by the staff and faculty. Administrators will sit in on admission interviews to make sure that all mechanisms 
are in proper place.
