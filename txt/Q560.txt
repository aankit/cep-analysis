Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

At Robert F. Wagner Jr. Secondary School for Arts and Technology we believe that students learn best when they  

1. Practice intellectual curiosity. We embody an inquisitive spirit, read and write critically, engage thoughtfully in 
academic discourse, and express ourselves creatively through art and technology. 2. Develop strong, positive 
character traits. We strive to practice continuous reflection, persist in our academic and extracurricular pursuits, are 
self-aware, and operate with a deep sense of integrity. 3. Engage in schoolwide & community citizenship. We are 
resourceful, believe in collaboration, advocate for ourselves and others, and work to develop a strong sense of social

responsibility in and beyond Wagner. This school wide belief is aligned with the Danielson Rubric that we use to 
evaluate pedagogues, and the school's professional development plan aligns directly with this mission of how all 
students learn best. All students will graduate college and career ready.  

  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Robert F. Wagner, Jr. Secondary School for Arts and Technology consists of 650 students from grade 6 through grade 
12. The school population comprises 6% Black, 67% Hispanic, 10% White, and 17% Asian students. The student body 
includes 6% English language learners and 15% special education students. Boys account for 52.4% of the students 
enrolled and girls account for 47.6%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2016 -2017 was above 90%. 

 

Robert F. Wagner Secondary School for Arts and Technology (“Wagner”) is a small school in Long Island City, New 
York. Our school is based upon the belief that all students can learn at high levels. We foster the development of 
natural curiosity towards creative expression, creative learning and creative service. Our academic program is 
student-centered, rigorous, and prepares all learners for college and career-readiness. 

OUR SCHOOL is based upon the belief that Arts and Technology are not just elective classes; they are tools that 
enhance student learning that will contribute to College and Career readiness. Every teacher, in every subject area, is 
committed to increasing their use of arts and technology to support and enhance student learning in their classroom. 
In addition, all high school students are given introductory classes to visual arts, media/technology arts, and theater 
arts. As upper-class men, Wagner students are given the opportunity to select into one of the following advanced Arts 
and Technology Academies: Media/Film, Musical Composition, Musical Performance, Studio/Visual Art, and Theater. 

OUR TEACHERS are specialists in their fields. As such, we desire for our students to experience each of their classes 
through the eyes of an expert. Wagner’s students are given opportunities to engage authentically in questions that 
are “real” to the content disciplines. They are given access to the tools and language of each special field. As curious 
learners, we rely on multiple sources to deeply understand topics of study and research. 

OUR STUDENTS are doing the hardest work in a classroom. Our teachers work very hard to gather resources and plan 
effective lessons every, single day. However, it is the students who should be actively engaged in seeking knowledge, 
producing high level products and making important conceptual connections. Wagner teachers don’t give the answers 
to difficult questions. They ask high level questions and expect students to grapple and collaborate toward answers. 

 

Our school’s support organization is New Visions for Public Schools, a non-profit organization whose goals are to 
strengthen schools, prepare leaders and teachers, and help align curriculum to the demands of the Common Core 
State Standards. Wagner also partners with Liberty Partnership an organization that helps provide funding for test 
preparation class for the SATs and Regents. Giving back to the community is also important and the school partners 
with Grow NYC to help maintain and sustain a community garden. We also run a robust after school program 
consisting of tutoring programs in academic subjects as well as enrichment activities for students such as Chess Club 
and Robotics. To round out our partnerships and programs, we offer 12 PSAL athletic programs after school ranging 
from golf to wrestling.  

The schools strengths begin with each adult knowing the students in our small learning community. We have been 
able to begin raising academic expectations and achievement for students with the addition of 3 additional Advanced 
Placement classes. The school hopes to maintain a calm environment that is conducive to both student and adult

learning. This year we would like to focus on raising our data in College and Career Readiness, our middle school ELA 
progress, the expansion of our Advanced Placement Program, and focus on streamlining the schools structures.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have students with I.E.P's that learn in a Collaborative Team Teaching environment. We also have students that 
are English Language Learners who receive instruction from a certified ENL teacher. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

According to the Framework for Great Schools, our school has made great progress in the areas of trust, effective 
school leadership, collaborative teachers, strong family ties, and supportive environment. The school needs to 
continue to work on developing rigorous instruction. The school will implement teacher inter visitation protocols, and 
continue instructional observation cycles. Teacher teams will continue to meet on a weekly basis and revise unit plans 
by evaluating student work products using the student work protocols (Ongoing). Baseline assessments will be 
administered in all academic classes by September 2018 in the Middle School and High School. The baseline 
assessments will be used to inform instruction and provide multiple points for entry for all learners. Midterm 
assessments will be administered to all students by January 2019. Teacher teams and final assessments will be 
administered in June 2019.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
According to the latest School Report data, it was cited that the school needs to close the achievement gap between 
our college and career readiness results and our 4 year graduation rate.. The school’s college and career readiness 
levels at 69% which is 14% higher than the city, but still a significant gap with our 96% graduation rate. There was also 
an increase in student responses on the NYC Schools Survey, 92% of the students say that adults keep them on track 
for college and careers, a 7% increase over the city average. The Parent Response on the NYC survey increased from 
35% to to 72%.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, we will increase the percentage of students from 65% to 69% who are "college ready" by providing 
students with more opportunities to be College and Career Ready. This goal can be measured by ensuring how many 
students take higher level Math Regents exams like Algebra II as well as AP course syllabuses approved by the College 
Board in Fall 2018. This increase in AP courses is in line with the Mayor and Chancellor's request for Advanced 
Placement classes for all.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
We looked at multiple data points including our Quality Review, NYC School Quality Guide, and the NYC School Survey 
and found there was a need for students to have an adult in the building whom they trusted. We wanted to create a 
more structured and robust program where teachers would get the opportunity to meet with students for a longer 
period of time. Students know the adults in the building but to see their teachers as also an adviser, someone who will 
support them academically and emotionally through the school year.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, we will raise positive student response on the School Survey from 67% to 70% on "personal attention 
and support" respectively. All students will be programmed for at least 2 day a week advisory class. In addition, all 6 th 
grade students will have CORE class every day to check in with an adult about their academic progress and skills and 
9th Grade students will have CORE 4 days each week and will receive individualized support and attention.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As pointed out in our Quality Review, a professional development plan needs to match the needs of teachers. 
According to the research, building capacity within an organization is a form of the strongest professional 
development. There are also pockets of very strong practice amongst our staff, having the time to share and train 
each other on those is the difficult part. The Professional Learning Team decided to have Professional Development 
be a time where teachers can share promising practices with each other in three designated professional 
development strands. Teachers, administrators, or outside consultants will present and train the staff on various 
teaching strategies that are student-centered and student driven. Follow-up will occur at the end of each cycle where 
teachers can present how they have taken the PD and implemented it into their classrooms in a showcase. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, we will improve positive teacher responses from 52% to 65% in regards to quality of Professional 
Development on the School Survey. We will form a Professional Development committee who will help develop the 
year's PD based on teacher and administration's feedback and schoolwide data.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed 
to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

 

In October 2018, we will create a shared vision and belief as 
what professional development is at Wagner and how we assess 
its effectiveness. We will also develop a rubric according to our 
shared beliefs and the rubric will be used to assess each PD 
presentation each Monday afternoon. The results of this 
assessment will be shared with the presenters. This shared 
vision and belief includes students who have IEPs as well as ENL 
students. 

A professional develop calendar will be created and a draft will 
be published for staff members to provide feedback on. The 
assistant principal for academics will meet with each facilitator 
weeks before to review a viable professional development for 
staff members. Students with IEPs as well as ENL students needs 
will be shared and discussed each week.

This year we are implementing Skedula’s DDC Exam Generator for teachers to create and assess students 
appropriately. We have set aside a midterm week during the first week of February for teachers to administer exams 
and gather data about where their student is in the middle of the school year. This will help to support teachers in 
getting regular feedback on student performance in CCLS standards-based learning. Additionally, the curriculum and 
software support students in tracking their own learning and setting/making their own learning. Teachers have the 
ability to create their own assessments as well as will synthesize and reflect on the results with their co-teachers, 
grade teams, department teams, as well as with parents, students and administrators. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Robert F. Wagner Jr. Secondary School for Arts and Technology, in compliance 
with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and 
implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving 
them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to 
actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained 
volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Robert F. Wagner Jr. Secondary School for Arts and Technology will support parents and families of Title I students 
by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
  The rationale for our direct instruction in class as well as our supplemental program is to 
provide English language development for our current ELL students.  Students are broken into 
different groups depending on their fluency in reading, writing, listening and speaking in the 
English language.  Students get assistance from a licensed ELL teacher during class which may 
include small group instruction.  Students receive language instruction in English and are in 
classes with students who are fluent in the English language.  We have one certified ELL teacher 
and 4 teachers who are licensed in their content area to provide students with the content and 
support in English language development skills. 
  
The grades are 9-12.  There are 3 groups.  There are 12 students in 9th grade, 11 students in 10th 
grade, 5 students in 11th grade, and 5 students in 12th grade.  The subjects being offered are 
math, English/ESL, science and social studies.  The numbers of teachers are 3 teachers  and there 
is one certified ELL teacher.  The program begins the week of October 01 and ends the week of 
June 03.  There are 30 sessions.  The days of the program are Tuesdays and Thursdays from 
3:10-4:10 p.m.  The schedule for the program is once a week and each teacher is designated to 
incorporate academic vocabulary into lessons.  The teachers push-in and there is also small 
group instruction and the ESL teacher pushes in to each group for 20 minutes.  
  
Different materials are used for students such a visuals, bilingual dictionaries, books that are on 
student's reading levels, sentence strips, personalized journals, audio books, and more.  We want 
to make sure that we are using all the resource materials we possibly can to make sure students 
are comprehending content level material. 
  
The literacy based program, Grammar in Use, serves all students in their classroom.   The 
interactive program  is engaging and will increase student's English Language Acquisition based 
on Common Core Learning Standards. The program is aligned with Common Core State 
Standards because the reading and writing selections are mostly non-fiction.  Data-driven 
instruction will be used to track our student's literacy growth along the four modalities: reading, 
writing, listening and speaking.  This program brings explicit English language instruction and 
enriches English skills for intermediate/advanced students.  The after school program will 
prepare the students to advance to the next level or become proficient on the NYSESLAT test.  It 
also covers skills that will be assessed on  mandated assessments. 
The rationale is to assist students in their English language development skills. 
All ELL students will participate in this and there will be three groups. 
Subjects offered: Math, English, Science, and Social Studies

3 teachers and an ELL certified teacher.  The ESL teacher will work and push-in with 
students.  Students will work with high interest, low-level books, content material that has been 
scaffolded or includes visuals for students.  The program begins October 01 to June 03 and 
includes 30 sessions on Monday and Wednesday from 3:00-4:00PM.

Begin description here:            
  Our rationale is to provide our teachers will professional development throughout the year.  We 
consistently look for professional development opportunities provided by the City, New Visions, 
our school support organization, as well as outside opportunities.  We also have Monday PD 
meetings that we try to provide all teachers with development in meeting the needs of all 
learners, including English Language Learners. 
  
2018-2019 Wagner Professional Learning Plan  
Wagner professional development is a collaborative process of improvement that exposes 
pedagogues to promising methods and theories. Through a collaborative discourse, teachers 
share, learn, and critically reflect on articulated needs. The ultimate purpose of Wagner 
professional development is to build a learning process that increases achievement for every 
learner. 
The Professional Development Plan is comprised of weekly sessions designed as “Inquiry 
Cycles” that are focused on articulated needs (from teachers) and identified gaps (from quality 
review). Each cycle will: 
•     Be developed and facilitated by Wagner teachers and administrators and New Visions 
coaches or systems managers (when necessary).  
•     Be chosen by teacher participants based on (a) professional interest/need, (b) feedback from 
supervisory cycles, and (c) data from student work or assessment. 
•     Follow a six-week format with 5 PD Sessions and 1 “Show What You Know” Full Faculty 
Debrief, where participants will have some structured time to share the work done throughout the 
cycle.

Access Points for All Learners (2 Sessions) 
 Each “Session Cycle” will include:   
•     Targeted Learning Objectives focused on relevant pedagogical development 
•     Student Work Protocols (connected to PD Pathway theme) 
•     Mid-Cycle and End-of-Cycle Assessment 
•     Embedded Checks for Understanding 
•     Specific connections to School-Wide Instructional Vision  
Each session will achieve the following outcomes: 
•     Specific products generated from participation in PD  
•     Data gathered from used protocols (tuning, student work, school-wide data)  
•     The focus of supervisory work on evidence of PD experiences in lesson plans. 
•     Feedback (PD Assessment Tools, Individual Presenters’ Surveys, etc.) for each session. This 
could be generated from a Google Form.   
As teacher facilitators prepare these experiences, they will have opportunities to work with Dave 
on the structure, content, or facilitative aspects of the PD planning and implementation process. 
Remember, this is meant to be a supported process that will both improve the teaching and 
learning and contribute positively to the collaborative process of professional learning at 
Wagner.

Begin description here:            
  We try to involve our parents in everything we do and believe that the more the parent is 
involved and knowledgeable of what is happening at the school, the more successful the student 
will be.  Everything the school backpacks home is translated into the home language.  We have 
also borough in translators during parent teacher conferences so that our parents feel comfortable 
speaking with our teachers regarding their child's progress.  We also have translators at our 
Parent Association Meeting (if needed) as well as our School Leadership Team Meeting (if 
needed).  Parents receive announcements from the school by having fliers back packed home, we 
also mail things home, and we make phone calls home by our advisers, guidance counselors, 
assistant principal, and principal.  We call in parents for one-on-one meetings to review the 
progress of their child and individual needs.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Tentative schedule for parent workshops (all times are 6:00-8:00 p.m. and all will take place the 
second Tuesday of each month): 
September- Parent Choice meeting (ELL Coordinator) 
October- Yearlong expectations (Guidance Counselors) 
November- Preparing for Regents (Grade Team Leaders) 
December- Holiday Potluck (Parent Coordinator) 
January- Progress Reports and planning (Guidance) 
April- Study Skills (Assistant Principal for Academics) 
June- Preparing for the following year (Assistant Principal for Academics) 
  
Parent are invited to meetings, both one-on-one and large group parent meetings.  Spanish 
translators are available in all parent meetings.  We also hire outside translators to help with 
heavier parent traffic during parent teacher conferences which are held four times each year 
(September, November, March, and May).  Other meetings that are held in the school to involve 
parents and have the ELL students achieve mastery are:  High School Selection Orientation (8th 
grade), High School Orientation (9-12), Curriculum Night, Parent Conference Night, Parent 
Orientation for ELL's, PTA meetings and NY State assessment (English Language Arts, 
mathematics, science, NYSESLAT and high school regents) Orientation.  This meeting are 
approximately one hour each.  Each meeting discussed the logistics of each test and what the 
possible outcomes are for the students. The rationale for this meeting is for parents to gain a 
better understanding of the annual testing their child would encounter and what the outcomes 
mean for their educational future.  The OELL also hold conferences and workshops for 
parents.  They will be notified of these activities through our automated call system and fliers 
sent or backpacked home.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The school uses the Performance Series as a way to measure student literacy skills in both reading and writing.  This data 
provides insights into an ELLs reading levels which assists us in our instruction.  We are also able to see students writing 
abilities and where we should focus our target instruction.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We work in teacher teams to ensure that students are reading at grade level.  Students are assessed at the beginning of the 
school year and monitored by the ELL teacher.  Data is then shared out with teachers. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

We evaluate the success of our programs by expecting and supporting ELL's to pass courses and Regents at the same rate as 
their non ELL classmates.  Our data has shown uneven results and this is an area where we still need to grow.  We use Read 
180 to get baseline data for students. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We meet in teams to address interventions that work for each student whether that is tutoring after school, participation in 
Read 180 throughout the school day, as well as guided reading lessons that assist students with specific tools. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
For all our English Language Learners who score below specified levels of performance on the annual English language 
proficiency assessment we put a plan together to provide support services to the student.  We use many indicators or pieces 
of evidence such as number of years in ENL program, home language and English literacy levels, content area teacher 
recommendation, etc. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data patterns shown across grades is helping students move form being a long term ELL to being proficient.  We have 
found that once our students pass the six year mark and are considered long term ELLs, it is more difficult for them to get out 
of this designation.  it also makes it more difficult when students are older.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We meet in both grade and department teams where data is shared with all staff members.  We also use this data in our own 
classrooms to make sure we are strategically grouping students or various skills to focus on in small group instruction 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction is given by a core content teacher as well as an ELL certified teacher.  Students are grouped by levels and 
paired with students from the general education population.  Students travel together for a part of the day but may 
be in separate classes for their world language class or their art or elective class.  Students have blocked periods every 
other day for their core content classes.  Students also meet during their extension classes with an ELL certified 
teacher to further work on common core shifts and skills. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here:    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

           n order to meet the linguistic needs of our ELLs and to comply with Part 154 mandates, our students receive at least the 
minimum number of ELL instruction by a certified teacher per week as per charts 5.1 and 5.2 below. Students are taught in a 
two-teacher classroom with a general education teacher and an ESL certified teacher. In addition to this push-in model, our 
struggling students are offered additional language instruction in a structured extension course with an ESL certified teacher. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Our Common Core standards-based instruction utilizes a variety of materials that integrate listening, speaking, reading and 
writing, and foster critical thinking skills. The materials, aligned to the core curriculum, include native language sources and 
instructional technology to support both English and the primary language of our English language learners. Furthermore, 
classrooms are print rich with colored word walls, pictures, student work and charts modeling correct language usage. 
Teachers create opportunities for our ELLs to listen to English and interact with peers in small groups as well as opportunities 
for ELLs to participate in classroom projects that support language development. Furthermore, all our English language 
learners are provided with a variety of instructional strategies to assist them in the development of academic language and 
literacy. The six major types of scaffolding – modeling, bridging, contextualization, schema building, text-representation and 
meta-cognition, are evident in all our classrooms. Our ESL teacher works with our staff to support scaffolding learning for ELLs 
in their classrooms across all subject areas. Effective practices such as graphic organizers, semantic maps, modeled writing, 
and read alouds foster academic language development. Furthermore, teachers receive professional development in 
scaffolding learning for ELLs and integrating content and language goals for ELLs.  Academic language development is fostered 
by implementing guided reading circles, read alouds, audio books, graphic organizers, and modeled writing. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   We ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native languages throughout the year by administering the 
Performance Series, one at the beginning of the year, in the middle and at the end which covers each Content Area to ensure 
that students are making progress in the various content areas throughout the year.  We also meet with parents and students 
to share this data with them so they too can make sure they understand the progress they are making. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Our instructional plan for SIFE students includes making sure students have access to after school tutoring in specific content 
areas where they need assistance.  ELLs who are new comers are pulled out during the content area English classes to provide 
them with small group assistance in learning English basic skills such as reading and writing.  For ELLs who have been receiving 
service four to six years, they are placed in a general education class where work is differentiated using a variety of 
pedagogical strategies that include graphic organizers, leveled reading, outlines, breaking down a text, etc.  For long-term ELLs, 
students also work together with their ELl teacher to develop skills that they were weak in on the NYSESLAT test.  This teaching 
is done one-on-one and after school tutoring is also provided to these students.  We support our former ELLs by providing 
checks for students throughout the year to make sure they remain proficient.  We monitor student's progress through their 
independent reading levels and to see how they are progresisng in their ELA classes.  We also give them additional testing time 
on all assessments. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
We have implemented a school wide independent reading program where students have been given an assessment to 
determine their current reading level.  This test is called Performance Series.  From their, each teacher helps students pick out 
books that are on their level and confer with students to get them to the next reading level.  In addition, a vocabulary 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

development program called Membene is also used to help ELL students with developing higher level vocabulary so they are 
able to read higher level books.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We have hired more Special Education teachers to help students attain their English proficiency goals on their IEPs.  Teachers 
now work with a co-teacher in the four major content areas to ensure that students who are ELL-SWDs achieve their individual 
goals and they are receiving the support necessary in their classes. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The Title III program at the Robert F. Wagner Jr. Secondary School for Arts and Technology will implement two comprehensive 
after-school programs designed to increase English proficiency and improve NYSESLAT performance. The first after-school 
program will target our students to gain English proficiency through an accelerated computer assisted vocabulary 
development program. The second after-school program will target our Advanced and long-term ELLs to reach proficiency on 
the NYSESLAT exam with after school tutoring. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

The computer assisted vocabulary program will serve our ELL students after school as well as practice at home. Students will 
work with their specific level program and two ESL certified teachers will guide instruction. This program brings explicit English 
language instruction to our beginner ESL students. These beginner ELLs are a struggling population at our school and need 
additional targeted language instruction to supplement the general education curricula.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
After school programs are offered everyday after school which can inlcude a variety of programs from Chess to PSAL to art 
classes.  Students may attend any of these programs after school as there are no sign-ups, usually on prequisites, and no 
special materials are supplies needed. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Membene is a technology based vocabulary program that supppots ELLs by providing them with leveled texts that incorporate 
vocabulary words  to help students with the shift in Common Core Standards.  We have also purchased a variety of books so 
that students can access information that is on their level and have hired a librarian to assist students with choosing leveled 
books.  There are also SamrtBoards in every class so that students can see visuals of what they are learning.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In ENL, teachers support students by having material translated for students as well as to ensure students comprehend things 
in both their native language as well as in English. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

We use different technologies such as vocabulary in the Membene program as well as independent reading books that are low 
level, high interest to ensure that resources correspond to a variety of ages and grades. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Membene is a technology based vocabulary program that supppots ELLs by providing them with leveled texts that incorporate 
vocabulary words  to help students with the shift in Common Core Standards.  We have also purchased a variety of books so 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

that students can access information that is on their level and have hired a librarian to assist students with choosing leveled 
books.  There are also SamrtBoards in every class so that students can see visuals of what they are learning.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
The preparation program, targets our ELL students to reach proficiency on the NYSESLAT.  At the beginning of the school year, 
Wagner also hosts orientations to help students on every grade level acclimate to the school and to help students prepare for 
the year ahead.  We also have weekly CORE advisory courses where teachers help students with organization skills as well as 
college and career readiness skills.  Guidance counselors, teachers, students, parents and administrators are involved in 
developing the CORE curriculum. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Students may take a Spanish class for their world language elective. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Paste response to question here:    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 All ENL certified teachers will attend two professional development sessions offered by the OELL. Our student data indicates 
tat writing must be of primary focus for our ELL students, therefore, all teachers will attend Writing in the Content Areas for 
ELLs. Substitutes will be hired/coverages will be assigned while these teachers are attending the PD session. Teachers will 
check the DELLS website and weekly e-mails for professional development opportunities. 
The school has weekly professional developments as a staff as well as any PDs that are offered by the DELLs department. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
We have our CORE advisory classes that meet every day in 6  th   and 9  th   grades when students are transitioning from 
elementary to middle school and from middle to high school.  It is important that students meet with their CORE teachers 
everyday to check in with an adult who is aware of their academic and social emotional situation and who has an established 
relationship with the student's family. 
The school offers professional development for 80 minutes each Monday and all ELL teachers are encourage and attend the 
PDs offered by the DELLS office.  Records are kept in a data portal that the school provides and revisited throughout the year 
and during Parent meetings.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parent meeting times are scheduled every Tuesday morning beginning at 7:55 a.m.  We use this time to engage our parents, 
especially those who are parents of ELL students.  We also schedule meetings after school as well as Parent Association 
meetings focused on ELLs.  We use this time to discuss individual student goals, language development progress, as well as any 
assessment results we may have. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Records are kept by the ELL teacher in a binder that has notes about parent meetings and outreach as well as sign in sheets 
from meetings.  Notes are then transmitted to grade teams so that all teachers are aware of the meetings regarding a child's 
progress.  We meet with parents at the beginning of the school year, in the middle and at the end to ensure adequate progress 
is being made.  We also schedule intermediary meetings with parents in case there are new things that come up.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Daniel Albetta, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Robert F. Wagner Jr Secondary School for Arts and Technology provides numerous services to ensure that all 
parents have equal opportunity to communicate. All memos and letters that go home are translated in both 
Spanish and English. In addition, the annual survey and additional school surveys are available in Spanish, English, 
Arabic, and French. Next, all parent events are staffed with a translators (Spanish), so that non-native speakers 
(teachers, parents, and students) can communicate effectively. A small, yet vital percentage of parents do not 
speak English or have limited English proficiency (taken from the Home Language Identification Survey). We have 
also have translators who are hired to provide translation services to parents and we have purchased a service to 
equip parents with headphone sets to listen to presentations or meetings in their native language.  

The parent coordinator heads all language translation for parents. In addition, several bilingual parents have 
participated in translation activities in order to ensure spread of information to parents in an effective manner.
