Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

We, the staff, students and parents of P. S. 7 commit to SOARING to success. Together we will strengthen our diverse 
school community by supporting academic and social-emotional growth. We will always STRIVE to do our best, be 
sure to OWN our actions, and ALWAYS work together while RESPECTING ourselves and others. As a school community 
we will continue to work to achieve our fullest potential while moving along the path to college and career readiness. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Public School 7 is a culturally diverse school. The school population comprises of 13% Black, 80% Hispanic, 2% White 
and 5% Asian Students.  

 

Our commitment to improvement and success in academic and social areas led us to partnerships with organizations. 
Presently we have a partnership with East New York Reads to enhance the literacy development of the school 
community (parents, teachers, students). Through this partnership we were able to offer summer school to students 
in grades K-4. This school year one to one tutoring, buddy reading, and an after school program for at risk first graders 
was added. In addition, we are collaborating with our local library to offer needs based workshops for parents. 
Parents are empowered by the opportunity to become learning leaders. 

 

Our school strengths are the collaboration amongst staff, and administrators, as well as the open line of 
communication between parents and the school at large. We provide a safe environment for everyone. Another 
strength and accomplishment that we proudly embrace is the progress of our Special Education Programs/Integrated 
Co-Teaching (ICT) classes. Most of our teachers' measure of teacher practice rating is effective. In order to improve 
teaching and learning we are a Teacher's College Reading And Writing school. The partnership between family, 
teacher , and student may sometimes be challenging due to language barriers or time. To improve in that area 
translators are available throughout the building to ensure that everyone has access to all information. To 
accommodate the schedules of parents activities and workshops are conducted during the school day and in the 
evening.  

 

 

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The student body includes 16% English as a new language (ENL) students and 16% students with disabilities (SWDs). 
We pride ourselves in being a learning environment that supports our students in meeting their goals in academic and 
social emotional areas. Administration, staff, and parents work collaboratively and are in constant communication to 
afford our students a safe haven,as well as a rigorous and engaging learning environment. 

 

Our ENL teachers and students benefit from the partnership we have with Teacher's College. Teachers receive in class 
coaching that focuses on ENL and SWD best practices aligned to our current curriculum.  

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Based on the data 2017-2018 school year ELA and Math assessments we made progress. In ELA there was a 9% 
increase in levels 3 and 4. There was a 5% decrease in Level 1. In Math there was a 5% increase in levels 3 and 4. 
There was a 5% decrease in level 1. A key focus is writing critically about reading by using text evidence to support 
responses.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
According to the 2017-2018 data captured from the Teachers College Pre/Post Writing assessments the strand of 
Elaboration in Grades K-5 score on an average of 4.0 – 4.5 on the writing progression rubrics. The score range for 
proficiency in the strand should range between 5.0 – 7.0. 

 

Elaboration is a double weighted strand due to the fact that details are powerful and omnipresent. Writing relies on 
well-used details. 

 

After analyzing data from the writing samples and conference notes it is evident that students need to be taught 
explicit strategies and the mechanisms of skillful writers in order to select details that will improve their writing in all 
three genres prescribed by the CCSS (arguments, informative and narratives). Increased scores in this strand will lead 
to students scoring overall proficiency in their post assessments. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, at least 55% of students in grades 3- 5 (including ENL and SWD) will meet grade level benchmarks in the 
elaboration strand appropriate to their grade for informational writing by obtaining a scaled score of 5.0 – 7.0 on the 
Elaboration Strand of the Teachers College Writing Rubric.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
According to the 2017-2018 NYC School Survey responses, it was stated that 94% of our teachers from grades prek-5 
feel that students are safe in the hallways, bathrooms and cafeteria of their school compared to the District rate of 
93%. Even a higher percentage of teachers, 98% stated that they feel that students are safe in their classrooms. This is 
comparative to the District goal of 98%. Also relevant in the School Survey was a staggering 63% of teachers feel that 
students behave well in class even when the teacher isn’t watching and 62% of teachers say that students listen 
carefully when the teacher gives directions. 

 

Based on our 2016-2017 Quality Review we were rated Well Developed and received a score of 4.99 for promoting an 
environment that is safe and inclusive to all students while supporting social-emotional growth. 

 

Based on the 2017-2018 NYC School Survey responses parents responded as follows: 

97% of families say that at their school their child is safe 

97% of families say that School Safety Agents promote a safe and respectful environment at their school. 

 

After analyzing data from the 2016-2017 Quality Review and the 2017-2018 NYC School Survey responses it is evident 
that students must develop intrinsic habits and skills related to the principals of responsibility, planning ahead, 
respect for others, teamwork and balance. These principals are timeless, universal, and self -evident and will make an 
impact on their daily life.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

By June 2019, students will independently apply the P. S. 7 PBIS principles and demonstrate self awareness and 
incidences of positive behavior during non-instructional times such as lunch time, arrival and dismissal times. This will 
result in classes earning a minimum of 20 PBIS incentive awards.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
In order to ensure highly qualified staff members, the following measures are take 

*Mentors are assigned to support struggling teachers 

*Buddy teacher for new teachers in school and on grade 

*Hiring teams 

*Existing teacher references 

*Conversations with local colleges and universities 

*Administrators attend Fairs 

*Teachers attend PD outside of school then turnkey the information to their colleagues and administration 

To maintain High Quality Teachers(HQT), teachers will share best practices with colleagues in an effort to enhance 
students progress within the classroom. Also, inter-visitations are scheduled so that teachers may observe their 
colleagues and note differentiation and best practices.  

 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
High quality professional development for teachers, principals, and paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all 
students to meet the Common Core State Standards entails similar strategies and techniques as teaching to meet the 
needs of all students. Professional development should be planned and organized to meet the needs of the teachers 
as classroom teachers or content teachers. This involves preparing a survey or intake questionnaire in which teachers 
have the opportunity to share what they feel they need more professional development in to better meet the needs 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

of their students and to hone their instruction. (Danielson’s Domain 4) The same survey can be distributed to 
paraprofessionals as well. Once determined, professional development should be planned to address the needs, while 
being differentiated based on those needs, on student population (ELLS/Special Needs), and levels of experience. The 
participants must then have the opportunity to then apply what was learned, discussed, and shared and then to have 
feedback on the practice. This cycle will allow for development and will then directly positively impact student 
growth. We can also strengthen P.D.'s by using colleagues who show high proficiency in framework areas to share 
best practices.

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
P.S.7's Pre-K teachers attend Pre-K for All workshops to learn about strategies they can use to unpack DOE units of 
study. Teachers focus on their instructional track to embed art, dance and music into their daily lesson planning. 
Preschool students are exposed to the Pre-K Common Core State Standards. Teachers are involved in the curriculum 
mapping process and Professional Development through the city-wide Pre-K for All Initiative. The Pre-K social worker 
and family worker together provide parental learning opportunities to the families every month. These workshops are 
focused on academic, social, and emotional growth whose goal is to maintain parents updated on current practices. 
Parents are also invited to Parent Learning Opportunities that are school wide so as to begin to immerse themselves 
in topics that are not specific to Pre K such as , safety, how to help your child with homework through native 
language, and how to use technology as a support at home. Students participate in the Jump Start program for early 
literacy and “A Day in the life of a Kindergartner” where they spend a day in a kindergarten classroom and are 
introduced to routines and procedures specific to Kindergarten. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.

The curriculum team and instructional leads meet regularly to discuss Measurement of Student Learning (MOSL) and 
in- house assessment opportunities. Go Math, Social Studies Passport, Engage NY, Science and Teachers College 
programs provide targeted assessments based on the curriculum and Core Curriculum State Standards. These 
assessments provide students with opportunities to construct open responses, answer short response questions and 
complete multiple-choice questions. Teachers share input with their respective grade as to formatting the text aligned 
questions to ensure that it is a text dependent question that mirrors English Language Arts(ELA) prompts. The inquiry 
teams along with the coaches, analyze the data collection from multiple sources and plan specific Professional 
Opportunities based on findings to improve teacher practice and student learning. In Pre-K, teachers, 
paraprofessionals and administration meet to discuss assessments that were available for Pre-K. Teachers selected to 
incorporate COR Advantage as their formative assessment. COR Advantage is a birth-to-kindergarten assessment that 
assists teachers in supporting children at every developmental level — including children who are English Language 
Learners and those with special needs. It also provides administrators with more comprehensive reporting options to 
guide program planning and staff development. This assessment is anecdotal based and monitors student progress. 
Teachers enter anecdotals and scores online and track and group students for future learning. Teachers received 
professional development on line through both online webinars and archived webinars. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S.7, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student 
Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the 
connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed 
to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of 
their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and 
Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

P.S.7 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

Subgroup # 3: Newly Arrived Students 
Rationale: 
     At PS 7 we have a diverse student population. Approximately  22% of our students are 
English as a New Language Learners and that number rises every month. In grades 3-5 we have 
approximately 42 ELL's that have been in the United States for less than two years.  As students 
begin to enter third grade and continue to fifth grade we are finding that they are not  confident 
in trying out the English language in social settings such as the lunchroom and recess. They are 
self confident about what their peers might say .  Many of these students they revert to speaking 
only in their native language even though their auditory language is flourishing. These students 
face many challenges that are specific only to Newly Arrived students.  In the classroom teachers 
are maintaining fidelity to the New Language Progression Standards but at the same time a 
specific time needs to be set aside to develop language for basic needs such as parts of the body, 
places in my community, school life, etc. These are the foundational skills that will let them 
become acclimated in their new classroom and new country. 
     The parents of these students need support as well in learning key words and phrases that are 
necessary in supporting their children. For example, many parents  have stated to school 
community members that they cannot support their children academically because they don't 
speak English. This program would provide them with tools to assist with homework, oral 
language, building comprehension, etc. It is for these reasons stated above that we would like to 
create a Saturday Program targeted for students and their parents. 
 
Subgroups and grade levels of students to be served: 
     Our Saturday Program and our Morning Program will serve third, fourth, and fifth graders 
identified to have been in the United States of America for less than two years and need 
additional support in developing oral language. 
 
Schedule and Duration: 
     The Saturday Program  will run for four Saturdays. This program will begin on January 5, 
2019 and will end on February 9, 2019.  Each Saturday the students will arrive at 9:00 a.m. and 
dismiss at 12:00 p.m. Teachers will arrive at 8:30 a.m. for professional development and 
planning.  Each Saturday will focus on a different topic such as the basics (alphabet, numbers, 
colors, days of the week, month of the year, holidays), myself and my family, my school, and my 
home and neighborhood. Students will receive instruction for 90 minutes and then parents will 
work with their children as they are coached by the teachers for the additional 90 minutes.

ENL Bilingual teacher professional development will be made available to all ELL staff. 
Teachers will be afforded opportunities to discuss latest research, best practices, materials, 
standards, instructional strategies and alignment to Common Core State Standards , ELA Shifts, 
and the application of ENL methodologies. The philosophy of ELL Instruction for grades 3, 4, 5 
is best articulated in the CALLA approach (Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach). 
This approach focuses on academic and linguistic development of the target language and is used 
during the school day, after school, and push in and pull out programs. Best approaches will be 
assigned to support the ELL student and staff needs including professional development, best

Development plan for 2018-2019. 
 
We will measure the effectiveness of our PD by looking at the growth in student achievement. 
Running records will be assessed three times a year (October/January/May) and each student is 
expected to move at least 3 Fountas and Pinnel reading levels. ENL teachers will also use the 
ENL Progression sheets to monitor language acquisition growth aligned to the Common Core 
Standards.Newly Arrived Programs:Throughout the year many teachers have expressed concern 
about the importance of developing a curriculum that focuses on providing students with explicit 
instruction in English on topics that are immediately necessary for students. Teachers refer to 
this as "the basics". When exploring this topic further with them it became quite clear that often 
times these important first lessons are skipped or learned as a side effect to daily living situations 
with their peers. Parents are often frustrated because they don't have the skills in English to 
support their children and either feel embarrassed and don't attend parent workshops or attend 
and can't access the information. Teachers feel that they can address these concerns through 
strategic units of study where they will teach both students and parents basic vocabulary, and 
most importantly teach parents how to support their children.Teachers to receive training:All 
teachers in the program will receive training.Schedule and Duration:Every Saturday the program 
runs, teachers will meet for 30 minutes for planning and preparation.Teachers will meet from 
8:30-9:00 a.m.Topics to be covered:1. Each session will begin by going over the new unit of 
study and how it aligns to the New Language Progression Standards.2. Teachers will review the 
coaching model to be used during the second 90 minutes of instruction.3. Teachers will complete 
an activity where they have to role play coming to a new school in a new country and asking 
someone for help with:      a. finding your classroom      b. finding the restroom      c. asking 
someone for a pencilTeachers will share out how this experience made them feel and how they 
will take this activity and plan accordingly for their students.4. Social language /Academic

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The formative assessments that we use to guide instructional planning for our ELLs are: 
1. End of the Year Go Math assessment provides us with data on how well prepared our students are on the previous year's 
standards. 
2. Beginning of the Year Go Math assessment provides data on how well students are starting off the year understanding the 
current year's standards. 
3. Pre/Post reading and writing on-demands; each standard is assesses at least 2 times a year. 
4. Performance tasks in NYC Social Studies program. 
5. Chapter tests in Science. 
6. Mid-chapter Go Math tests provides a road map for how well students are mastering information for the first half of the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

chapter, and how much scaffolding is required for the remainder of the chapter. 
7. Fundations daily check-ins. 
8. Teachers College Spelling Inventory in grades K-2. 
Sulzy Scale in Kindergarten. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The structures that we have in place to support this effort are that we analyze data both horizontal and vertical teams during 
common planning times. This data is used to inform our Professional Development Monday cycles of inquiry, and is aligned to 
our year-long assessment calendar. Our testing coordinator monitors progress and updates data in a timely manner using 
Google Docs tracking spreadsheets. Our Child Study team focuses on data from targeted students that are at-risk, and discuses 
how they can provide additional scaffolds. Students are identified based on academic and language deficits. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The summative assessments that are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need are: 
1. iReady diagnostic assessment for reading and math in grades 3-5 
2.Post on-demand using TC for reading and writing 
3. End of Year Fountas and Pinell Running Records 
4. End of Year Go Math Assessments 
5. NYSESLAT 
6. NYSITELL 
7. NYS ELA and Math tests 
8. ELL Periodic Assessement 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The structures that we have in place to address interventions are: 
1. Our Child Study team meets bi-monthly 
2. AIS providers deliver instruction using a push-in model to provide TC guided reading and a double dose of Fundations 
4. East New York Reads provided first grade students with an after-school tutoring program called Read Alliance 
5. East New York Reads provided second and fifth grade students with monthly buddy reading opportunities 
6. iReady program  creates a personal journey for students to go on their own learning path 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Based on various assessments, both formal and informal, including observations, we use the data to analyze commonalities 
and to create small groups based on areas of need, also to create intervention periods. For Tier 1 we utilize the RTI portion of 
the GO Math Program for additional support. For Tier II, we use the Fundations Phonics program, as well as Computer 
Programs such as Starfall and additional iPad applications. Our Tier III students are identified through the AMAO estimator 
tool. These students are targeted for our Title III After School Programs.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The outcome assessment data that we currently use to evaluate and inform our ELL programs are the 
NYSESLAT, ELA and Math tests. 
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The structures that we have in place to support this effort are that the ENL Supervisor, ENL Coordinator and ENL teachers 
analyze data using the EDAT during common planning times. This data is used to inform our Professional Development 
Monday cycles of inquiry, and is aligned to our year-long assessment calendar. This data is also used to identify at-risk students 
for AIS, as well as push-in schedules and student grouping. Students are identified based on academic and language deficits.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 
In order to maintain rigorous instruction to meet the individual needs of our ELLs, in the four modalities of listening, 
speaking, reading and writing, we currently offer self-contained ENL program in grades K through 5. The Teachers 
College literacy program is being used in all grades. All ELLs receive their mandated instructional time based on the 
NYSESLAT from a certified ENL/Common Branch classroom teacher who integrates ENL methodologies throughout the 
scheduled day to ensure that the needs of all the students are being met. Entering and Emerging ELLs receive 360 
minutes of instruction per week in equal daily allottments from a licensed ENL teacher, which includes180 minutes of 
Stand-Alone English and 180 minutes of Integrated instruction. Transitioning and Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes 
of ENL instruction per week from a licensed ENL teacher in equal daily allottments, 90 minutes of Stand-Alone English 
instruction, and 90 minutes of Integrated Instruction. Commanding ELLs also receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction per 
week. The workshop model of instruction (whole-small-whole) is used in order to provide opportunities for utilizing 
specific Second Language methodologies. The Teachers College writing project will be implimented in our school 
through thematic teaching. We also have 28 students in Special Education who are ELLs who receive the mandated 
hours of ENL based on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT assessments. 
 
Push-In Model: 
ENL Push-In Model helps English language learners meet their academic needs. In this program, licensed ENL teachers 
push into classrooms with ELLs for two periods a day, four days per week, totaling 360 minutes. ENL teachers are also 
provided with one common planning period each week to plan with the classroom teacher. All of our ENL teachers are 
currently dually certified ESOL and Common Branch teachers. 
 
In order to help students to progress, we utilize the following practices: 
- Collaborative planning between ENL and ELA teachers for sheltered English and Content areas. 
- Scaffolding is an essential part of the instructional delivery, such as Modeling, Bridging, Schema Building, 
Contextualization, Text 
Representation and Metacognition. 
- Peer tutoring 
- Assisting students during work periods, Conferencing with students in and out of class, informal assessments, and 
running records. 
- Additional small group AIS sessions for each grade prior to all state assessments, to focus on literacy and academic 
language. 
Beyond explicit ENL, collaboration between teachers means that there is a consideration for the language needs of 
ELLs. Some aspects of this policy include: 
- Content area teachers monitor the understanding of linguistically challenging material and use a variety of phrasings 
and synonyms to clarify meaning. 
- A licensed ENL content area teacher work with ELLs in ENL classes for support in Science, Math and Social Studies 
using bilingual glossaries. Instruction is differentiated based on the proficiency level of students and follows the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

curriculum standards. 
- Math teachers devote extra class time to untangling difficult word problems, and require students to make verbal 
explanations of the problems they work on using math vocabulary. We utilize the Go Math program for all students in 
grades K-5,  which includes a  Spanish component. All math materials are available in English and Spanish for ENL and 
bilingual classes. 
- Social Studies teachers scaffold their instruction with technology, visual aids such as maps, atlases, and illustrations 
to increase comprehension. 
- Technology is used to support students at varied entry levels with the use of laptops and interactive Smartboards. In 
addition, students have access to sites such as Starfall and specifically Brainpop for ELLs. 
 
All K- 5th grade English Language Learners participate in the TC program, which is aligned with the Common Core 
State Standards. This program differentiates each lesson for ELLs on all levels of proficiency. In accordance with the 
individual student’s results of the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT, students receive the mandated hours of ENL instruction. 
Entering and Emerging students receive 360 minutes a week of ENL instruction. Transitioning and Expanding students 
receive 180 minutes a week of ENL instruction. Commanding students receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction. 
 
These classes modify language instruction to differentiate and accommodate the many language levels of the ELLs 
participating in the class. In each class grades 2-5, the classroom teacher works with the students to provide 
instruction in all areas, ELA/ENL, Math, Science and Social Studies. The teachers support student academic language 
development in ENL. English as a Second Language methodology is infused throughout all subject areas instruction. 
The students are engaged in content area instruction in both Spanish and English. 
   
 Teachers' schedules in ENL self-contained classes contain alloted periods of time during their literacy block 
specifically dedicated to 180 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL instruction per week, and 180 minutes of Integrated 
instruction (Math/Science/Social Studies). Program schedules for three ENL push-in teachers are designed to push in 
for two 45-minute periods a day, four times per week, equaling 360 minutes weekly. This ensures that each student is 
receiving the mandated amount of required minutes of instruction in both Stand-Alone and integrated instruction. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

We currently have a bridged 4th and 5th grade bilingual class made up of 17 students. Our Teachers College Reading 
and Writing program aligns to the NYS Common Core Learning Standards, as well as the NYC Science and Social 
Studies Scope and Sequence. In addition, during Guided Reading instruction, teachers utilize leveled informational 
and literary books in English and Spanish. Thinking maps are also used throughout content area subjects to develop 
vocabulary. The Go Math program contains a Spanish component, and various tools, such as math boards, have 
written instructions in both English and Spanish. Spanish glossaries are also included within the program to provide 
native language support. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

       Teachers' schedules are designed to allow for 180 minutes of Stand Alone ENL instruction and 180 minutes of Intergrated 
instruction. In the Free-Standing Model, students are grouped based on proficiency level, allowing for entering and emerging 
students to receive language instruction from a push-in ENL teacher. In our bridged TBE class, four 45 minute periods of Stand 
Alone ENL is included into their weekly schedule , as well as transitional minutes of HLA. In addition, our school has a Literacy 
Block which occurs each morning for 3 periods of ELA. These instructional minutes are reflected in our STARS Programming, 
and are monitered and updated on an ongoing basis throughout the school year.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Based on the data and language acquisition of the child, parallel instruction (English and Spanish) is implemented in order to 
ensure quality instruction is received in their dominant language in all content areas. Our TC literacy program aligns to the NYS 
Common Core Learning Standards, as well as the NYC Science and Social Studies Scope and Sequence. The Guided Reading 
component of the program contains books that are informational and literary texts. Thinking maps are also used throughout 
content area subjects to develop vocabulary. The Go Math program contains a Spanish component, and various tools, such as 
math boards, have written instructions in both English and Spanish. Spanish glossaries are also included within the program to 
provide native language support. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Running Records are administered by a bilingual teacher in the student's native language, as well as translated versions of unit 
tests, projects and essential questions in both literacy and math.     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. Plan for SIFE: 
Newcomers who enter with an interrupted education of at least 2 years will be identified by our Pupil Accounting Secretary as 
SIFE (Students with Interrupted Formal Education). In PS 7 we have 2 SIFE students, 1 in grade 4, and 1 in grade 5. In order to 
support the special needs of these students (in addition to the mandated 360 minutes of ENL), a pull-out teacher will provide 
small group instruction three times a week using explicit teaching of academic language. They will use the Wilson Reading 
Program to support them in small group settings with individualized attention to meet their special needs. SIFE in grades 4 and 
5 will also receive content area instruction in their native language during extended the school day with a certified bilingual 
teacher. There will be on-going assessments to make sure we are reaching the needs of all our SIFE. 
 
b. Plan for ELLs in US Schools Less than Three Years (Newcomers): 
Newcomers who have been in U.S. schools less than three years are also targeted for ENL instruction. They will receive 360 
minutes of ENL instruction by a fully certified ESOL/Common Branch teacher. Highly qualified ENL teachers will provide 
accelerated and explicit teaching of the academic language in all content areas during and after school. 
 
c. Plan for ELLs receiving services 4 to 6 years: 
ELL students who have received 4 to 6 years of ENL services will be invited to participate in our extended day and Saturday 
Academy where they will receive instruction by a licensed ENL teacher who will utilize reseources specifically designed for 
ELLs. 
 
d. Plan for Long-Term ELLs: 
Long-term ELLs will be identified by the BESIS report. Long-term ELLs will be closely monitored by the AIS and ENL team to 
make certain academic progress is occurring. NYSESLAT in collaboration with the ELA, Math, and Science assessments will be 
analyzed by the team, and a suitable educational plan will be created for long-term ELLs. The information from the data will 
drive the instruction in class, AIS group, after- school, Saturday Academy and morning intervention programs. 
 
e. Plan for Former ELLs: 
Former Ells will continue to receive the same testing accomodations for ELLs for two years after testing proficient. Former ELLs 
will receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction, and continue to be invited to participate in our extended day and Saturday 
Academy. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
In addition to technology, our math program contain lessons which differentiate instruction for ELLs, RTI and SWD. Teachers 
scaffold instruction for ELLs using visual aides, interactive smart board activities, bilingual glossaries, TPR activities, word walls, 
and peer tutoring.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 
ELLs with special needs will be identified by IEPs. Presently we have 28 ELLs with special needs as identified by their IEPs. 
The IEP will be analyzed carefully by the push-in ENL teacher, classroom teacher and the AIS teacher on SESIS to ensure their 
educational needs are being met. They will also have an ENL pullout teacher and an alternate placement paraprofessional. 
Our push-in program ENL teachers who work with SWD create interdisciplinary lessons in collaboration with our self-contained 
classroom teachers. Literacy and Math Unit pacing calendars are also shared with push-in ENL teachers. 
 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Newcomers who enter with an interrupted education of at least 2 years will work with a pull-out teacher who will provide 
small group instruction three times a week using explicit teaching of academic language. They will use the Wilson Reading 
Program to support them in small group settings with individualized attention to meet their special needs. SIFE in grades 4 and 
5 will also receive content area instruction in their native language during extended the school day with a certified bilingual 
teacher. There will be on-going assessments to make sure we are reaching the needs of all our SIFE. 
Newcomers who have been in U.S. schools less than three years are also targeted for ENL instruction. They will receive 360 
minutes of ENL instruction by a fully certified ESOL/Common Branch teacher. Highly qualified ENL teachers will provide 
accelerated and explicit teaching of the academic language in all content areas during and after school. 
ELL students who have received 4 to 6 years of ENL services will be invited to participate in our extended day and Saturday 
Academy where they will receive instruction by a licensed ENL teacher who will utilize reseources specifically designed for 
ELLs. 
Long-term ELLs will be closely monitored by the AIS and ENL team to make certain academic progress is occurring. NYSESLAT in 
collaboration with the ELA, Math, and Science assessments will be analyzed by the team, and a suitable educational plan will 
be created for long-term ELLs. The information from the data will drive the instruction in class, AIS group, after- school, 
Saturday Academy and morning intervention programs. Our staff also uses Acutiy which enables educators to identify and 
select educational resources aligned to the State Board of Education standards, providing the vital information they need to 
make critical evaluations. Acuity’s Math and Reading learning-based assessment programs promote success with robust, 
technology-enabled interim and formative assessments. Available on the Web and in paper and pencil, Acuity delivers targeted 
instructional materials to help prepare students for district and state exams and succeed in school and beyond. Acuity has a 
proven record of success will our ELLs due the individualization and interactive aspect of its system. 
Former Ells will continue to receive the same testing accomodations for ELLs for two years after testing proficient. Former ELLs 
will receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction, and continue to be invited to participate in our extended day and Saturday 
Academy. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Teachers College and Go Math programs will continue to be implemented so as to align with the CCSS. We will also be 
integrating the Socratic questioning, student-lead conferencing, and Reading A-Z program due to its success in the previous 
school year. We will also be integrating more informational texts throughout the day, and well as mini-offices in all classes.

c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Due to parent choice, our school does not currently offer the dual language program.    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 
NL/Bilingual teacher professional development will be made available to all ELL staff. Teachers, Paraprofessionals, Guidance 
Counselor, Special Education Teachers, School Psychologist, OPT and Speech staff, secretaries and our parent coordinator will 
be afforded opportunities to discuss latest research, best practices, materials, standards, instructional strategies and alignment 
to core curriculum and the application of the ENL prototype. The philosophy of ELL instruction, for grades 3 and 4, is best 
articulated in the “CALLA” approach (Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach). This approach focuses on academic 
and linguistic development of the target language and is used during the school day, extended day and Saturday Academies, 
best approach will be assigned to support the ELL student and staff needs including: professional development, best approach 
methodology, data analysis, comprehensive needs assessment, parental involvement, compliance and instructional issues, 
preparation for the NYSESLAT and program design. All ELL classrooms will be provided with highly motivating leveled 
classroom libraries. ENL in-service courses are being offered to all teachers of immigrant students to support the teacher in 
meeting the instructional needs of all ELL learners. Study groups conducted by the principal/assistant principal, and coaches 
will support the teaching of ELLs in the English Language classroom. Our administrators, guidance counselor and literacy coach 
support the staffas students transition from one grade level to another by holding an assembly for senior students regarding 
the transition process to middle school. Administrators from our community Junior High School are invited to address our 
graduating class  with information about the next school level, as well as answer any questions the students and families may 
have. Our guidance counselor participates in curriculum team and grade meetings, which provides her with information that 
will in-turn allow her to assist families and ELL students as they transition from TBE to monolingual classes. 
 
Professional development is coordinated by a curriculum team (the principal, assistant principal, coaches, AIS coordinators, 
parent coordinator, and UFT chapter leader) who work together to combine ideas on effective planning for teachers, on 
different ways to assess learning, on developing curricula and instructional materials, and refine school-based practices and 
update the professional development plans. On one level they work with staff to strengthen their knowledge base in literacy, 
mathematics and other content areas. The second level focuses on effective practices in the delivery of instruction. Most 
professional development will be delivered in the teacher’s classroom during common preps. These sessions will also used as 
an opportunity to turn-key current ENL policies by attendees of district meetings. 
 
Our Guidance Counselor, Ms. Rocha, conducts the following professional development workshops for parents and teachers; 
Respect for All, PBIS, Hygiene, Dad's Day, and School Policies. At Parent workshops, parents are given numerous websites and 
outside resources which offer translation services. In addition, our school guidance counselor assist ELLs by conducting 
classroom presentations on what to expect in middle school, getting familiarized with school policies and academic 
expectations/requirements. Also, in January our guidance counselor will be beginning the Cloud 9 character education 
program for students. Materials for this program will also be available in Spanish. 
In addition, our ENL Team, comprised of ENL and TBE teachers, as well their supervising Assistant Principal, Ms. Abrego, will 
meet after school, on the second and fourth Wednesday of each month, to share best practices, develop instructional 
strategies, conduct inquiries, analyze data, and work on action projects. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

Targeted differentiated professional development will be delivered each month during our 37.5 minute professional 
development sessions. These sessions will be utilized to significantly increase the capacity of the teaching cadre to support the 
ELA curriculum, English Language acquisition and student learning. Professional development will take place through, but not 
be limited to: weekly scheduled articulated professional development; Coaches performing the above described roles; teacher 
scheduled inter-visitation, administrative snapshots and observations, Regional Instructional Specialist professional 
development sessions and teacher support activities, Instructional Support Specialist support activities, study groups, etc. 
Teachers will learn from all of the mentioned activities expanding their knowledge base, capacity and educational toolboxes. 
Learning styles and differentiated instruction will be addressed in classrooms as teachers become more comfortable with 
varied methods of delivery of instruction. Teachers will differentiate instruction by providing instruction targeted to the deficit 
skills of each child. Professional development is coordinated by a curriculum team. 
Professional development plans for the 2015-2016 school year include orientation for all teachers on the Bilingual Common 
Core Progressions, NYSESLAT Testing and evaluation of results. We will also have focused and detailed training in ENL 
methodologies for all staff members servicing ELL students. Some topics to be covered are: 
· ESL methodologies – The Inductive Approach, Grammar - Translation Approach, Direct Method, Cognitive Approach, 
Situational Approach, Comprehension-based Approach and Total Physical Response, CALLA 
· New Language Arts Progressions/Home Language Arts Progressions 
· Best practices for instructing ELL students through the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project 
· Differentiated Instruction in the Content Area-Math, Science ,SS, Technology 
· Technology Assisted Instruction in the ENL/Bilingual Classrooms 
 
Professional development sessions in ENL will be held for teachers in-house during common preparation periods on the 
following dates: TBA Monthly meetings are offered to ENL teachers by our Learning Support Organization, in which the latest 
advances for ELLs are introduced. The ENL teachers turnkey all new information to the staff. Those responsible for providing 
the training are: 
· Administration (principal and assistant principals) 
· Literacy and Math Coaches 
· ENL teachers 
· In-house AIS Providers 
· LSO Specialists including the ELL Program Specialist and Math, Science, Technology, Humanities Content Specialists. 
In addition, we ensure that all teachers receive their 7.5 hours or 10 hours for special education teachers of strategies in 
teaching Ells. They are scheduled to attend various professional development training and workshops that will fulfill this 
requirement. Sign-in Sheets and Agendas of all PDs and workshops held indicate the dates and times of each session, and are 
kept on file by our ENL Coordinator. The ENL Coordinator will hold Lunch & Learns for ELL staff training. In addition, a blog will 
be maintained by two of our ENL Teachers to keep the school staff updated on current practices in the ESL classroom. These 
sessions are conducted by grade, school-wide; and include webcasts, book studies, professional literature, outside consultants, 
and school visits. In conjunction with our staff developing, our Principal, Assistant Principals and School Counselor all receive 
professional development from the district regarding ELLs.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
 
The Title III parent component will address two distinct parent needs, parent education and adult ENL instruction. Parents will 
be invited to attend parent workshops. The parent sessions will address various topics of interest to ELL parents including 
parenting skills, and school governance and involvement skills. The parent coordinator, Ana Perez, will work with teachers and 
parent representatives to develop a menu of workshops that interest and support parent engagement in the school. A parent 
survey is conducted to learn about workshops topics that would be of interest to parents. Parent workshops will be directed by 
Bilingual and ESOL certified teachers in English and Spanish on the first Wednesday of each month. Parents will also be invited 
to participate and be trained in the Learning Leaders Program so they can be volunteer tutors in the classrooms. Workshops 
will be given in the native language on topics such as rights and responsibilities of parent and students, school grading policy 
and procedures for parent teacher conferences. In addition parents will be invited to participate in ENL language acquisition 
sessions designed for adult learners. Some of our workshops/activities for parents and families include our Math Games Day, 
Mother's Day luncheon, and Poetry Assembly. Parents are also invited to join our Cool Culture program where families are 
given free tickets to various museums throughout the city. We also offer a Parent Resource library. 
 
All written communications being sent home in English will be translated. Our Parent coordinator, Ana Perez and Family 
Assistants will support efforts to involve parents in the school and community through outreach via phone and one-on-one. 
Interpreters will facilitate communication with parents in native language where available. Parent workshops will continue to 
be offered to parents of English Language Learners in all subject areas. Our math and literacy staff developers and parent 
coordinator will conduct workshops on the first Wednesday of each month. Parents are also invited to attend our orientation 
session during our Open House where parents are informed about school programs, state standards assessments, portfolios, 
school expectations, and general program requirements for bilingual and free standing ESL programs by our ENL Coordinator, 
Ms. Vasquez. All school correspondence is translated into Spanish. In order to support the learning community, we will offer 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

 

 

English as a Second Language to adults at our school. Our adult ENL program will use real life situations to build language while 
being immersed in culture; such as going on trips to museums, movies, library, and using the computer. These scenarios will 
allow them to develop the language associated with these activities; such as how to make a purchase, order at a restaurant, or 
understand the language of computer technology. 
 
Additionally, families are invited to attend our monthly PTA meetings on the third Wednesday of each month, as well as 
classroom activities, and culminating school wide trips and activities. Some of the activities in the 2017/18 school year included 
a visit to the Brooklyn Museum, a Core Knowledge walkthrough at our school, and various assembly programs that are based 
on current Core Knowledge themes and topics. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

One of our ENL teachers conducts monthly parent workshops with the parents of ELLs. Topics are selected based on a parent 
survey. Periodic trips with parents are also scheduled throughout the school year.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Carolyn Noel, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In order to assess the language preferences of our parent community, our school uses to the QADM report in ATS 
which is gathered upon student registration. This information is taken from the HLIS. We then refer the RAPL and 
RHLA reports in ATS which gives us both the written and spoken languages preferred by the parents. In addition,
