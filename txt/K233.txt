Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Our mission statement is as follows: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

The Langston Hughes School community’s mission is to provide a safe, nurturing and predictable environment where 
our scholars can learn to think critically, question the world around them, communicate their thoughts, feelings and 
ideas articulately and show empathy for others. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Public School 233 The Langston Hughes School is located in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York. Our Pre-
kindergarten through fifth grade school serves a population of approximately 507 students from culturally diverse 
backgrounds. The community is home to many families from the Caribbean countries of Guyana, Trinidad & Tobago, 
the Dominican Republic, Haiti and the island of Jamaica. Recently, we have welcomed families from Arabic and 
Bengali speaking countries. Public School 233 is a Title I school in good standing. 

Current strategies for instruction in English Language Arts include the implementation of a comprehensive literacy 
approach using the balanced literacy model for reading. Our students are provided with opportunities to experience 
independent/paired reading, shared reading, guided reading, literacy centers, writer's workshop, interactive read-
alouds, word study, and teacher/student reading and writing conferences. This work is done using the Teacher’s 
College Reading and Writing program in Kindergarten, Journeys in grades 1 and 2 and Expeditionary Learning in 
grades 3 through 5 as the primary literacy programs. Pre-kindergarten uses the Teaching Strategies Creative 
Curriculum program. 

Go Math is the primary vehicle for math instruction in the school. It is aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) and focuses on the skills and strategies that provide students with opportunities to develop mastery 
through practice. 

Science education at PS 233 offers students various ways to understand, make predictions about, and adapt to an 
increasingly complex scientific and technological world. Students are given opportunities to model a scientist's 
method of investigation, study plants, and recycle through "hands-on" activities and an inquiry based approach that 
incorporates scientific thinking processes. We participate in the Garden to Cafe program that is centered around our 
outdoor and indoor gardens. We also have an ever-growing focus on sustainability. 

The primary focus of the social studies instructional program is on authentic research. We follow the New York State 
Core Curriculum and work to provide students with a higher level of understanding of history and the world around 
them. Technology is infused into all curricular areas through the use of classroom computers and our computer lab. 

The arts program at P.S. 233 offers students experiences in music, dance, and visual arts. Our students are introduced 
to piano, drums, guitar and voice. In dance they are introduced to line and swing dance. Students are given instruction 
in music and dance beginning in pre-kindergarten. The focus of our arts program is the Harlem Renaissance era, in 
honor of Langston Hughes. The Harlem Renaissance era was the introduction of white America to the beauty of 
African American culture. We work to nurture in our students a love of their culture and the ability to see the beauty 
in other cultures as well. 

Selected fourth and fifth graders can participate in chorus. Our partnership with Arts Connection allows students in 
grade three to be tested for our violin program. Selected students receive instruction through grade five. The Ifetayo 
Cultural Arts Academy affords our students the opportunity to study African dance and drumming.  

Parent involvement includes an active Parent Teacher Association (PTA) and a Parent Coordinator that is employed by 
the Department of Education. We offer parent workshops, parent outreach, and a Parent/Teacher Book Club. Parents 
also participate in and are active members of our School Leadership Team (SLT) where they share the decision-making 
responsibilities for the education of their children. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Approximately 13% of our student population are children with special needs. This includes students that are learning 
disabled, emotionally disturbed and those exhibiting signs of autism. Their needs are met through a range of services 
that include Integrated Collaborative Teacher teams, self-contained classrooms, intervention services, supplemental 
services and counseling. Approximately 3% of our student population is made up of students who are learning to 
speak English. Their needs are met by a full time English as a New Language (ENL) teacher, instructional grouping and 
translation services. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

We continue to make progress in the implementation of the Framework for Great Schools. Our current data reflects 
that when compared to the other schools in our district we received more positive responses on 89% of the elements 
of the School Quality Report. When compared to other schools in the city we received more positive responses on the 
elements of the report 75% of the time.  

Our area of celebration is our ability to maintain a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that support the 
academic and personal growth of students and adults. We will work to increase our performance in all areas with a 
focus on Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment, and Strong Family-Community Ties.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
To provide our students with rigorous Instruction we collaborate to plan units of study and performance tasks to 
ensure that our curriculum is aligned to the Common Core. However, in order for the school's strategies and practices 
to align with the concepts in the element of Rigorous Instruction we need to modify our plans to provide access to all 
learners. Feedback from our 2017-2018 Quality Review indicates that student work and discussions, tasks and 
assignments are not yet designed with scaffolds or supports for different learners. Therefore, our students were 
unevenly engaged in appropriately challenging tasks and our student discussions inconsistently reflected high levels of 
student participation. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, school leaders and teachers will collaborate to develop protocols for revising lesson plans and units of 
study. The result will be that 80% of our Special Needs students, English Language Learners and students who 
performed in levels 1 or 2 will demonstrate a 5% increase in student achievement as measured by multiple forms of 
assessments in English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

1. Our school articulates and systematically promotes a vision for social and emotional developmental health. 
However, in order for our strategies and practices to align with the element Supportive Environment we need to: 

· Strengthen the communal vision and shared understanding of clearly articulated skills and behaviors that 
demonstrate social and emotional developmental health. This will ensure that students can learn and use behaviors 
that support a safe, inclusive environment for all constituents. 

· Continue to refine the Positive Behavior Intervention & Support (PBIS) plan to include professional development and 
online resources for staff to build capacity and improve the consistency of implementation. Monitor the 
implementation to provide supplemental support as needed. 

  Continue to refine the Response to Intervention (RtI) plan to improve our ability to identify and support 
students who struggle academically and/or emotionally but are not receiving Special Education services 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

By June 2019, we will continue to refine our school-wide system for Response to Intervention (RtI) services for 
emotional/behavioral and academic needs. As a result, we will demonstrate a 10% drop in the number of students 
who are referred for removals and suspensions as evidenced by our monthly Online Occurances Reporting System 
(OORS) reports. We will also demonstrate a 10% increase in the number of identified students who are serviced 
through our RtI process.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our latest Quality Review indicates that there are inconsistent uses of ongoing checks for understanding to adjust 
instruction to meet students’ learning needs. It also indicates that our formative assessment practices are inconsistent 
across the school. While our school schedule provides opportunities for teachers to collaborate daily to use various 
forms of data to inform lesson planning, develop explicit lesson plans and foster student participation in their own 
learning process. In order for our strategies and practices to align with the element of Collaborative Teachers we need 
to: 

Develop a professional development plan that supports teacher growth and development in the creation of tasks, 
assessments, lesson and unit plans that are rigorous and provide all students with access to the curriculum 

 

Identify instructional and assessment strategies that lead to targeted instruction and increased student 
engagement  

· Make timely adjustments to instruction that includes grouping, scaffolding or extensions, and the use of conferring 
and note-taking 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 

  By June 2019, school leaders will develop, implement, monitor and evaluate protocols and systems that provide 

professional learning opportunities for teachers. This will result in a 5% increase in scores in ELA and 
mathematics measured, by multiple forms of summative assessments.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

While, administration makes strategic decisions to organize resources concerning human, programmatic and fiscal 
capital so that school improvement and student goals are achieved, feedback from the latest Quality Review indicates 
that the monitoring of student progress using student performance data is limited and inconsistently used to make 
decisions about the instructional core. In order for our strategies and practices to align with the element of Effective 
School Leadership I need to: 

· Deepen the integration of systems and structures currently in place to monitor the progress of teacher practices 
based on STARS Reading, Journeys, Expeditionary Learning and Go Math unit assessments, MoSLs, and summative 
student performance data, observation feedback and professional development opportunities 

· Implement a comprehensive system to evaluate teaching practices to encourage and support teachers in taking 
ownership of their development as educators.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the school’s average teacher proficiency regarding Instruction (Danielson components 1e and 3c) will 
increase by 0.25 points as evidenced by observational data in ADVANCE.

welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

Our school engages in effective planning and reciprocal communication with family and community stakeholders so 
that students’ strength and needs are identified and used to augment learning. Our latest Quality Review feedback 
indicates that our school’s approach to culture building and discipline includes outreach to families and professional 
learning and activities relative to a responsive classroom philosophy for all students and staff. In order strengthen the 
school's strategies and practices to further align with the element Strong Family-Community Ties we need to: 

  Continue to survey school staff, parents, and students to identify their concerns as well as assess the 
effectiveness of established initiatives, such as PBIS and family workshops, and solicit suggestions for 
improving the home-school communication process. 

  Refine the school’s professional development plan to align with a school-wide parent involvement plan  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Langston Hughes School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The Langston Hughes School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
As an ENL instructor Ms. Slowe assesses the level of frequently used vocabulary and phonemic awareness of English Language 
Learners (ELLs) using sight word recognition screening that is differentiated by grade level. The data collected from this 
assessment given during the beginning and end of the school year are used to increase our ENL students' weakest areas of 
reading and writing identified on the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL. Those words that were identified incorrectly or were marked as 
unsure and self corrected, will be reviewed in centers with sight word board games, flash cards, homework with sight word 
searches and other various puzzles, using the words in sentences and identifying them when asked to with a highlighter in 
homework assignments. Classroom activities include verbally identifying sight words during mini lessons to increase reading 
levels and fluency as stated in the goals of ELLs and measured by DRA data. 
 
Ms. Slowe administers a reading preference and learning preference survey. This details a student's independent literacy level, 
as well as their reading and learning preferences. This information is shared amongst all instructional staff and used to appeal 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

to a students preferences and dislikes in reading material to ensure literary selections are appealing for ENL students. Their 
preferences of study atmosphere, level of support needed, and their view of reading is surveyed to give insight when making 
instructional choices of skills and strategies to strengthen their weakness in an important area of language acquisition.With 
this year's purchase of the WIST and TOSWRF assessments to measure silent word reading fluency  through sight word 
proficiency, identification  and spelling.  The data collected  and analysed will  be used to  guide instruction once strengths and 
weaknesses are identified 
 
In Ms. Slowe's assessment process, ENL students are also assessed on their level of phonemic awareness for alphabet 
identification and sound. Letters incorrectly identified, or self corrected will be reviewed in centers, homework and classroom 
activities. This assessment and practice also helps students build their phonemic awareness, the foundation of many literacy 
skills and strategies that we use to improve reading levels, fluency, intonation, and literary understanding, as measured with 
DRA, and NYSESLAT assessments. 
 
ELLs are also required, with necessary accommodations, to take all standardized assessments after they have attended public 
school for at least one entire school year. As per our 2015-2016 school year data, our assessment results have shown that 
100% of the ENL population has demonstrated greatest weakness in the area of literary vocabulary. Phonemic awareness 
difficulties effect 65%, and 80% of our ELLs are having difficulty decoding words, and literary word usage. 
 
We use all assessment data to help guide instruction and tailor it specifically to provide support in weak areas and strengthen 
proficient skills. Classroom instructors of ELL students use assessments such as DRA Kits to assess reading levels. This 
assessment tool helps us to gauge a student's level of literacy advancement.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Common planning every day on each grade 
Universal Screening 
Classroom assessments 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
PS 233 uses a variety of tools to evaluate the success of our ENL students such as periodic Wilson Foundational Skills testing. 
This allows us to measure our students phonemic awareness and language skills necessary for growth in reading and writing. 
This data is recorded and periodic administration provides us with substantial documentation that can be used to guide 
Common Core aligned instruction, and spiralling to revisit areas that are identified as weaknesses. ELLs are given preference 
surveys in the beginning, middle, and end of the school year to share their thoughts about their learning process and 
preferences as it relates to specific subject areas and what conditions are most conducive to their learning. These surveys 
allow students to take an active role in molding instruction. NYSESLAT and NYSITELL results, NY ELA and Math assessments, 
DRA kits, and NYS Science results for the upper grades are additional periodic assessments that help us to track student 
progress and adjust curriculum to meet our Annual Yearly Progress.  
This school year we purchased the WIST and TOSWRF assessments to measure silent word reading fluency  through sight word 
proficiency, identification  and spelling. The data collected  and analysed will  be used to  guide instruction once strengths and 
weaknesses are identified. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Universal screening 
Response to Intervention (RtI) services 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
PS233 uses data to guide instruction within the RTI framework. We provide ENL students with quality, Tier 1, core instruction 
within a Freestanding ENL Program. Tier 2 students of grades 1-5 in need of more intensive instruction receive Extended Day 
instruction that consists of small groups to address their deficiencies. Students in need of further intervention at a Tier 3 level 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

 

are offered services by either a speech or S.E.T.S.S. teacher. We currently don't have any Tier 3 students but are actively 
working on additional tier 3 intervention services for one of our ELL students. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
According to the 2017-2018 data patterns across proficiency levels and grades on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT, it is shown that 
our  beginning level students in grades K-5, performed significantly better in Speaking and Listening than Reading and Writing 
due to their overall weak literacy skills in areas such as phonemic awareness and grammar. The same can also be said for our 
students in grades 1-2. Our three advanced students in grade 3 have demonstrated their weakest area to be in writing 
according to test scores. Data collected during assessments guide instructional planning and development to meet the specific 
needs of ENL students. All PS233 instructional and administrative staff members work as a collaborative body to help every ELL 
reach a level of proficiency. The data from last school year's NYSESLAT scores reveal that data-driven instruction has played a 
key factor in moving students to the next level of proficiency overall, while writing still presents a challenge for our 9 students. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

During the initial days of training when all teachers return to school in September, all staff analyzes school wide data and 
trends to identify areas of strength and those that need. Weekly common planning time where grade levels can meet and 
discuss common trends, formative assessments, deficiencies and an academic action plan to redirect or replace current 
programs, curriculum, and methods with those that are more conducive in moving towards independence and proficiency. As 
of the 2017-2018 school year teachers are able to share academic documentation, thoughts, comments, action plans,  and 
progress, with one another as well as parents on a school wide web site platform. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

According to AAELL some common features of ENL academic success are some of the same practices used in our 
Stand Alone ENL program. We utilize a Stand Alone model that is heterogeneous and ungraded. The structure of our 
program enables the ENL instructor to meet with classroom teachers 1-2 times per month to discuss the growing and 
changing needs of our ELL population. Langston Hughes Elementary School's leadership has a clear school vision that 
includes high expectations for ELL student achievement supported by a purposeful plan of action that continuously 
monitors ELL student progress (e.g., student work, formal and informal assessments, test results), and systematically 
adjusts instructional planning based on a wide variety of evidence and data. Teachers and school leadership at 
Langston Hughes Elementary get to familiarize themselves with their ELL population and their individual needs during 
instructional meetings between the ENL and classroom teacher, logs that are passed between the teacher and ENL 
instructor with ENL student anecdotal, strategies, 
events and suggestions. Our Teachers support and learn from each other in a way that recognizes the 
interdependency of language proficiency and Common Core content instruction. Professional development materials 
are turn-keyed during the ENL instructor and classroom teacher meetings, as are best practices , artifacts, and 
materials. Professional Development is given by our Field Support Center (FSC)  specialists who define and provide 
detail on RTI practices and strategies as it applies particularly to our 
ENL/SWD population. 
PS233 highly values parent and community involvement, and takes active steps to ensure that all stakeholders are a 
part of the school’s culture through our open door policy, and invitation to school events such as Curriculum Night, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

 

Class Trips, School Performances and PTA meetings. PS233 currently consists of a hybrid freestanding ENL program 
structure that incorporates a one hour push-in period for each ENL child, as well as a pull-out component of 4 hours 
weekly where students are grouped across 2  grade levels K through 1,  2 through 3 and 4 through 5. They are 
grouped according to grade and proficiency levels to provide the optimal balance. When students are not in the 
stand- alone ENL structure they are in an integrated ENL setting submerged in a general education classroom . 
Differentiation of instruction takes place according to their individual student needs. We also employ ICT classrooms, 
which consists of 2 instructors, SED and GEN ED. In our classrooms, students are grouped according to the strategy 
being used in each subject area. For example, guided reading groups may be organized according to skill deficiencies, 
or proficiency levels. Peer and group activities of various subject areas may be arranged according to individual 
strengths and weaknesses that complement one another and best assist each student to arrive at the teaching point.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

We do not have a TBE Program    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

We do not have a Dual Language Program    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           PS 233 ensures the mandated number of instructional minutes are delivered in each program model according to their 
Levels of proficiency being Entering(EN) , and Emerging(EM)(360  mins) with 180 minutes of the time being spent in an 
Inclusion setting that provides core content instruction in ELA as well as other core content standards based subject areas like 
Science and Social studies. Transitioning(TR) (180  mins), Expanding(EX)(180  mins),  and Commanding(CM) 180mins,Proficient 
ENL students after the first 2 years of scoring out as proficient receive 90 minutes of weekly inclusion ENL instruction to assist 
with their transition to mainstream education) by carefully programming Ms Slowe's schedule in such a way that we 
accommodate each student's academic state requirements of  integrated(180,  or 90 minutes) and stand-alone time . Ms. 
Slowe collaborates and co teaches with Each integrated teaching setting and provides support and reteaching opportunities 
for ENL students in their content area subjects. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Content area is delivered in our Free standing ENL program with a combination of materials that consist of of techniques, 
strategies, and tools for L1 support of our ENL students during our push in and pull out modeled structure such as,   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Our Stand- alone  modeled ENL program design is based on English only instructional Content with home language support 
such as dictionaries in their native language, technology for pictorial, translation and interactive programs in their native 
language as well as flash cards, dictionaries, and games that are assessed through teacher observation when being used for 
support. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

There currently aren't any SIFE students identified at PS233 for the 2014-2015 school year. However, in the case that there 
were SIFE students they would participate in Extended Day, as previously described, a buddy system with peers or classmates 
who can show students around and help them adjust to the daily schedule and instructional routines. Baseline assessments 
would be given along with the appropriate academic supports. While state-wide standards in their original format may be too 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

advanced for SIFEs, it is possible to adapt standards-based lessons so that they cover the most important information in a way 
that is accessible, culturally relevant, and age-appropriate. We may also consider using thematic curriculum, individual 
learning plans, or alternative ways of gaining assignment credit. 
Explicit instruction in an age-appropriate manner of the five components of reading - phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, 
vocabulary, and comprehension, increase student access to literacy-rich environments and print materials, and unifying 
language and content instruction. When possible, 
additional time in a smaller group setting would be given if scheduling allows. Instruction that facilitates active engagement, 
prior knowledge, picture cues and aids, print rich environment, cultural content when possible, working in cooperative groups 
and frequently checking for understanding. All of these instructional concepts would be applied to the student's content 
appropriate instruction. 
All  of PS233's ELL's who have been in this country 0-3 three years do not perform well in the two modalities of reading and 
writing, and our 1 English Language Learner receiving services 4 to 6 years performs well in the listening and speaking 
modalities, however performs fairly in Reading and experiences difficulties in reading and writing. None of our current ELL 
population has completed 6 plus years of ENL/ELL service. The Workshop Model, whose reading and writing strategies are 
used within our freestanding ENL program and school wide for ENL foundational support with our 0-3 year population 
familiarizes them with the structure of literature, and how to create it using constant modeling, and practice of basic rules 
taught, demonstrated and practiced. 0-3year ENL students who are struggling, and SIFE students receive additional instruction 
during ELA and other content areas in smaller groups that utilize their reading notebooks for various literary and vocabulary 
activities that entail identifying new and unfamiliar words using context clues, illustrations, a word to word, or picture 
dictionary, online resources, and googled images. Graphic organizers such as Venn Diagrams to compare and contrast,and 
make connections, T-charts, What I Know, Want to know and Learned graphic organizer are used to help organize thoughts. 
These tools are used to organize thoughts and develop writing in the pre writing stages of the writers workshop. The "What 
We Think We Know" organizer By Tony Stead, is simplified for 0-3 year ENL students and the complete chart is used for 4-6 
year ENL students. Instruction for our 0-3 year ENL population relies greatly on the use of manipulatives such as: visual aids 
(flash cards, signs, posters, videos), student plays and demonstrations, blocks, cards, dice, artefact's, play money, etc. These 
supports are used during ENL pull-out periods and in the classroom. Our 4-6+ year ENL population and 0-2 year proficient 
students rely less on these resources for support during Common Core Instruction. However, they are easily accessible to 
students for use when needed. ENL Students use the Internet and many ENL related websites facilitated by Ms. Slowe, their 
frequency of independent navigation on a given site is determined by their years of ENL instruction in relation to their 
language ability. 0-3 year students limited language ability limits their activity usage on the computer as well as their length 
and complexity of its use. All ENL students log in a notebook where their reading activities will be accompanied by 
comprehension diagrams, maps and various writing genre activities. according to their proficiency level and years of ENL 
service, The more years of service the more complex the organizer. All of our ENL students will also utilize the grade 
appropriate, supplemental materials from the Publishers Continental Press, entitled, New York ELLs 
student workbook for ENL/ELL students, and their Read , Reason, Write workbook series all grade level appropriate . In our 
ENL pull out and Push in class, students will use the key strategies of the Lucy Calkins reading workshop that can be used 
throughout an ELL's academic journey even after leaving the program. 
  
Our English Language Learners perform well in the listening and speaking modalities, however those who are 
experiencing difficulties in writing will receive supplemental writing practice across all subject areas, as they are asked to 
explain their findings in detail. This skill helps in all content areas, as Common Core's theoretical focus is based on higher order 
thinking, and justifying one's thinking. They will be exposed to various genres that teachers will model, students will then 
imitate, and participate in a year long school wide celebration of various writers and writing styles to increase literary 
comprehension. In ENL, all students learn about the mechanics of writing using the Lucy Calkins Writer's Workshop Model. The 
workshop model is one that, though it's structure is the same for all level ELL students, the process scaffolds allow for 
differentiation among grade, and proficiency levels. These skills are also used as a supplemental tool in mainstream ELL 
classes. The writers workshop model provides support and time for practice of the skill taught. The finished product is used as 
an assessment tool to identify re teaching areas to be implemented in instruction through a spiraling process. All of these 
strategies and key components in the journey of a beginning level 0-3 year ELL student will be gradually used less frequently

nurtured and fine tuned. These strategies would be revisited as needed for the transitional support of any students who reach

6 or more years of service, those in need of Tier 3 strategies, and those students who test out of the ESL program 0-2 years 
later. Former ELL 
students having 0-2 years of Proficiency are still granted the test accommodations of extended time, the use of word to word 
dictionaries in their home language, and highlighters which they have been trained to use throughout the year. 
Students use the Internet and many ENL related websites facilitated by Ms. Slowe They keep a notebook where their daily 
reading activities will be accompanied by comprehension diagrams, maps and various writing genre activities. Our ENL 
students will also utilize the supplemental materials from the Publishers Continental Press, entitled, New York ELLs Student 
Workbook for ENL/ELL students, and their Read , Reason, Write workbook series, all grade level appropriate . In their ENL class 
students will use the key strategies of the Lucy Calkins reading workshop that can be used throughout an ELL's academic 
journey even after leaving the program.  Testing accommodations for (less than 2 years)former and current ELL students is the 
usage of highlighters if they are trained to use them as well as the use of a word to word dictionary. Current ELL student's as 
well as former ELL students who have exited prior to two years also have the option of time and a half with timed tests, having 
the Math standardized test in their home language, and 90 minutes of integrated ENL.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Classroom teachers of ELL-SWDs at PS 233 have access to the SESIS system where they can print a hard copy of their student's 
IEP. This helps instructors to identify the specific needs of their student. Teachers of ELL-SWD use various strategies to provide 
access to academic content areas and accelerate English Language development. Those strategies include: Peer Teaching, 
visual 
cues, time to think and respond, sentence starters, and providing various ways to answer or share ideas utilizing their stronger 
modalities. In Peer Teaching a ELL-SWD is paired with an Intermediate to high level student who has patience, can model 
desired behavior, speaks English as their primary language and is strong in the skill being taught. Technological tools, like 
Smart boards and iPads, provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development. They have 
been proven to be  very successful in supporting language development strategies in all content areas.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Response is needed from an  entire team of participants to accurately answer this question  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Response is needed from an  entire team of participants to accurately answer this question   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Response is needed from an  entire team of participants to acurately answer this question  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

This question is not applicable. We never had a bilingual program that was offered at Langston Hughes Elementary School 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Those students who attend after school and Saturday Academy are chosen according to academic need. All of our ENL 
students are not on grade level in either or both ELA and Math which makes them an automatic selection for one of those 
programs.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is delivered using tools such as word to word traditional and picture dictionaries, a translation 
program on Ms. Slowe's iPhone, flash cards, promethium board, word for word translation, teacher created work as needed. 
Vocabulary support in content areas using flash cards that have the definition, vocabulary journal, picture, sentence and 
synonyms as well as additional activities to practice the use of this new word. Each student had a vocabulary journal where 
they illustrate, use and demonstrate in useful ways, the meaning of their words alongside the translated form of the word in 
their home language verbally  through a speaking program and written by the teacher.

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
For the school year of 2017-2018, There currently aren't any such programs in place for ENL students or any other student.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

For the school year of 2017-2018, There currently aren't any such programs in place.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

For the school years of 2017-2018, There currently aren't any such programs in place.  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The professional development for all ENL/SWD personnel at the school consists of curriculum planning activities that benefit 
all students including the ENL population in that it includes an ENL and SWD component in each program that is implemented. 
We do not have a specific PD plan devoted to ENL personnel due to our small population. The ENL teacher goes to PDs and 
turn keys the information to staff members. 
The PD's delivered by Ms. Slowe have helped teacher's to understand their ENL student's language acquisition process and 
needs as well as strategies, skills, online programs and resources that can be used a support in content areas as well as all 
other areas in the classroom. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section.

All off site ENL Professional Development sessions  attended by MS Slowe are documented with a DOE form that's  filed with a 
copy of the training agenda and turned into the payroll secretary. All in house training, including ENL turn keyed trainings, 
requires the use of a sign in sheet to  monitor who its attendees were. Our guidance counselor attends Middle School 
Application Process workshops which prepare her to meet the needs in the area of providing support to our ENL population 
along with the support of our in house translators and NYCDOE translation Unit.  
 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
For the school year of 2017-2018, PS 233 has open school night and the ENL teacher is highlighted on the list of teachers to 
visit on the report card,notices sent home, by verbal mention of the homeroom teacher as well as on the print up of the 
organizational map for the evening with the teacher's content area and name.During an ENL parent conference Ms Slowe 
discusses each student's current status, expectations, strengths and weaknesses, shows examples of student work and teacher 
notes taken during push in sessions.  How parents can assist their child is discussed as well as any upcoming school/ENL events 
and resources available to them. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

For the school year of 2017-2018, PS 233 is currently working on a Title lll funded ENL program to provide  English Language 
acquisition sessions to ENL parents as funding allows. Parents have requested such services but have found it more convenient 
to attend our location closer to home. This program not only fosters parents' ability to  communicate with others, complete 
day to day activities and emergencies, but also to help and assist their family and children academically.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Denean Stephens-Spellman, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and 
activities are adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The data and methodologies used by PS233 to assess language preferences of the parent community for both 
written and oral communication include pertinent information captured from Part III of the Home Language 
Identification Survey (HLIS) which specifically asks what language they would prefer to receive written and oral 
communications from the school during the time of admission, ATS reports, which clearly state the identified 
household’s primarily spoken language as well as the student’s primarily spoken language, Student Emergency 
Contact cards also identify a parent’s desired language of communication during the time of an emergency and 
Surveys conducted by your school allow us to revisit and reform the necessary procedures to ensure efficient and 
accurate communication of the parent’s choosing

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of a school emergency PS 233 will use multiple options of communication available to them, such as an 
automated “ robo-call” system, email provided for every student registered, text messages, as well as calls that are 
made by designated staff to alert parents of emergency events. With the help of PTA we are implementing a parent 
buddy system that pairs lower proficiency level parents with parents who are more fluent in English with the same 
home language to be one resource for urgent notification. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Teachers who service and instruct ENL students are given handouts yearly pertaining to translation service option 
and procedures that are kept in their ENL binder as well as meetings with the ENL team members

offered and who they might contact at their school to inquire of such services. Signs are also posted near and in the 
main office, with the parent coordinator, PTA and other high traffic locations around the school. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parents are given a brief 2-3 question oral, written, emailed or text survey as periodically deemed necessary according 
to parent participation at events activities which help us to consider creating additional language support systems 
that’ s monitored and sustained by any staff member or parent that has a comment or suggestion for improvement
