Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Redwood Middle School is a diverse, collaborative, and supportive learning community where high expectations and 
engaging curricula enable all students to think critically and persevere though challenges in order to be successful in 
high school and beyond. We believe students who are engaged, appropriately challenged, and focused on advocating 
for themselves and others will have a positive impact on their communities and realize their dreams. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Core Values: Our core values illustrate our belief that all students can and will achieve academic success and become 
positive agents of change. Our core values represent the traits and skills students need to be successful in college and

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Redwood Middle School strives to provide each child with the supports he/she needs to be successful. As an MSQI 
school, we provide additional periods of targeted literacy instruction to all our students whether they are below, at or 
above grade level. Additionally, in the 2018-2019 school year, RMS will be offering additional period of math 
intensives.  

 

RMS uses a multi-tier, interdisciplinary approach to literacy instruction that focuses on language acquisition and 
academic vocabulary, debate, and the explicit teaching of reading comprehension strategies. A key area we continue 
to focus on is improving students’ literacy skills. We have a diverse population and are tailoring our instruction and 
programming to support all students. This also means we are supporting all teachers in their ability to teach literacy 
skills in the content areas. 

 

Students also participate in advisory which helps further develop skills needed to be successful in high school. During 
advisory students set daily and long term goals and create plans for those goals. Students meet each morning with 
their advisers in morning circle to set the tone for the day.  

 

Technology is an integral part of the curricula at Redwood. Our students use technology to enhance their classroom 
learning, using i-pads, laptops and desktop computers in various subject areas to support learning. In math, students 
use a self-paced math program, IXL, to further develop their math skills. This year we are expanding our class offering 
to include software engineering. This curriculum is supported through a DOE grant.  

We continue to make great strides in developing a supportive environment and developing a culture of collaborative 
teachers. Teachers at RMS participate in weekly lesson plan studies and student work analysis. These sessions are 
facilitated by teacher leaders because of our belief in the importance of building capacity within our school. A key 
focus area is to continue to deepen our feedback and assessment cycle which will provide more rigorous instruction. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

In order to support our continued growth of ENL students, we have hired a dual licensed ENL/ Special Education 
teacher. Her work will continue to support our students. 

 

We also will focus on deepening our community and family ties as we enter our fifth year. We will be developing 
Academic Parent Teacher Teams, through the support of MSQI, to further engage parents in the school. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Redwood has a growing ENL population that come with varying levels. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Redwood made the most progress in rigorous instruction and collaborative teachers. We plan to continue to focus on 
rigorous instruction and strong family community ties for the upcoming school year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Our curricular choices are aligned to the CCLS as evidenced by student growth on school-based assessments, 
specifically standards based math assessments and Degrees of Reading Power assessment. Furthermore, the '17-'18 
Learning Environment Survey revealed a positive score of 96% and 100% in literacy and math respectively in shifts 
towards the Common Core. 

 

While our students showed great growth on both the ELA and Math state exams in 16-17, our proficiency ratings 
were 25% and 19% respectively. This indicated a need to ensure our lessons are scaffolded properly as well as 
extended for all students. We are awaiting the results of '17-'18 exams. 

 

The 17-18 Learning Environment indicated that discussion practices are an area of need, with a 63% positive survey 
response as well as a trend of developing in 3B across teacher observations. Additional analysis of teacher 
observation data revealed trend of developing in the use of Assessment in Instruction as well. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all ELA teachers will provide differentiated instruction utilizing student work and data to improve 
student's ability to analyze complex text as evidenced by a 3% increase on the NYS ELA exam.

structures needed to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other 
high-need student subgroups (e.g., 
overage/under-credited, SIFE, STH). 

All teachers will receive an informal observation to 
identify their current level of performance in Engaging 
Students in Learning (3C) and Assessment (3D) 

Department Planning Time: One hour a week will be 
devoted to teacher collaboration in departments: 
Literacy, Math, Science and Social Studies. These sessions, 
facilitated by department leads, will allow teachers to 
reflect on current assessment practices in their 
classrooms including designing unit plans/performance 
tasks aligned to CCLS, planning ongoing assessments in 
lesson plans and analyzing assessment data. 

At least once a month professional learning time will be 
devoted to reviewing assessment data in order to provide 
appropriate scaffolds so all students, including ENLs and 
SWDs can access the tasks. Professional learning sessions 
will be facilitated by the principal, assistant principal, peer 
collaborator, model teacher 

Monthly professional learning will be differentiated to 
support teacher growth in Engaging Students in Learning 
and Using Assessment in Instruction (PL calendar, 
resources and topics to be created based on staff need. 

Teachers will engage in Cycles of Learning (Inquiry teams) 
in which they will identify an area of focus and develop a 
strategy, including method of measurement. They will 
meet every two to four week to analyze assessments and 
make adjustments to meet student need.  

Parents and Teachers will engage in the academic parent 
teachers teams. Teachers will meet 4 times a year with 
one class of parents to discuss data and share strategies 
they can use at home to support ELA/math instruction 

Teacher Leaders and Administration will complete bi-
monthly learning walks with a focus on instruction. 
Feedback will be shared at department meetings.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
The 2017-2018 Quality Review indicated there was consistent communication of high expectations to all staff 
regarding teaching and learning outcomes. It also indicated that we effectively communicate with families around 
student progress. However, initial qualitative data shows students do not consistently treat each other with respect 
and the 2017 learning environment survey revealed a 79% positive response to classroom behavior. As a school 
community we have established an advisory program and use restorative practices to address student off-culture 
behavior. We need to deepen and extend this work, as well as the pedagogical skills of teachers to manage their 
classrooms, to improve the overall respect students show each other and staff, and create a culture of “It’s cool to be 
smart”  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, there will be a 3% increase in teachers' environment survey positive responses to questions around the 
category Supportive Environment: Classroom Management, driven by our school wide implementation of PBIS 
practices.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The 16-17 Quality Review stated that the use of varied assessment practices have led to some teachers and students 
receiving limited feedback regarding student learning outcomes, thus hampering effective adjustments to meet all 
students’ learning needs. Additionally, a deeper analysis of teacher ratings during the 2017-2018 school year in 3d 
revealed inconsistent practice among departments. This indicates a need for teachers to work collaboratively within 
and across departments to develop consistent assessment practices that move student performance. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, all math teachers will work collaboratively to develop accelerated units of study and tiered tasks that 
embed Algebra I content in order to put all students on the trajectory for the grade 8 Algebra I Exam as demonstrated 
by the creation of six units and tasks tied to the Algebra 1 curriculum for grades 6 and 7.

impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers in all departments will have at least 2 collaborative 
planning periods in their schedules for the 2018-2019 school 
year. Teachers will use this time to share strategies observed 
during visits. 

During Monday PL sessions teachers will participate in 
meaningful professional learning sessions. These sessions will 
include opportunities for teachers to present best practices to 
their colleagues in each department. Teachers will also present 
best practices across departments. 

Teachers will debrief observations with Teacher Leaders to 
discuss take-aways and next steps for instruction. Teacher 
leaders will follow up by visiting teachers' classrooms. 

Model Teachers will create a year-long inter-visitation calendar, 
including debrief sessions with visiting teachers, to be modified 
based on teacher need.

support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The learning environment survey indicates 94% of teachers responded positively to questions around inclusive 
leadership. While this is a strength, we would like to increase teacher influence at Redwood Middle School. Teacher 
leadership will be utilized to strengthen teacher practice and build leadership capacity to support all students. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, all teachers will create curriculum maps for their units incorporating their higher order thinking questions 
and assessment calendars, shared on the school's digital curriculum platform, driven by professional development and 
targeted observation.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The Framework for Great Schools shows only 81% of stakeholders agree with the opportunities for parent 
involvement. This data point is supported by the number of parents who regularly attend PTA meetings. One strength 
is in the consistent number of parents who are regularly involved with school events. However, we would like to 
increase that number so more parents are regularly involved with school events, meetings, etc. It is vital that we 
increase opportunities for parent involvement as we continue to grow in our sixth year.

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
All teachers are vetted through a rigorous and multi-step hiring process. To ensure highly qualified teachers, all 
applicants are required to submit a cover letter and resume that is evaluated against a rubric by the hiring committee. 
The top candidates are then invited in for an interview. Interviewees’ responses are evaluated against a rubric by the 
hiring committee. Top candidates are then invited to participate in a demonstration lesson and follow up with the 
administration team. 

Teachers are provided with many leadership opportunities as a strategy to retain the best teachers and spread their 
practice across the school. Teacher Leaders are identified and given the opportunity to help coach/mentor new and or 
struggling teachers.  

Teacher programs are designed to encourage collaboration and provide ample common planning time throughout the 
day. This is another strategy to retain teachers and support their continued development and growth. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Each Monday, all teachers engage in professional learning time. The PL plan is designed collaboratively with the 
teachers and the administrative team. The plan lives in draft form and is revised based on our school-level 
expectations of common assessments/rubrics, targeted feedback, and student questioning/discussions.

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
As a school, we have assessment weeks built into the school calendar. During these weeks all core subjects administer 
CCLS aligned assessments, including MOSLs. Teachers use common planning and PD time to make assessment 
decisions, as indicated on pages 13-15 of the CEP. The following week is “reteach” week where teacher provide 
students with additional support based on the previous week’s assessments. Teachers are collaborating with their 
departments to create rigorous, common core aligned assessments and common rubrics. Teachers provide students 
with targeted feedback as well to improve student performance. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible

for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met.

2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Redwood Middle School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A 
of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Redwood Middle School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37

children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We currently use both the DRP (Degrees of Reading Power) and the TCRWP Running Records to assess the literacy skills of our 
ELLs, along with the checks of understanding teachers use in all classes.  Additionally, the ESL teacher uses a baseline 
assessment include the curriculum. 
  
This data informs the targeted instruction during the ENL literacy class, such as vocabulary support, reading comprehension 
and writing skills, as well as the targeted support provided during ELA.   
  
Additionally, all teachers will use teacher-created assessments to assess the needs of all students, and specifically ELLs, to 
ensure units and lessons are appropriately paced and scaffolded.  
  
Our current data indicates that of our ENL students benefit from an program that support both language acquisition and

general literacy skills. 1 student is a newcomer, and is utilizing both an online program (Rosetta Stone) as well as a supportive 
peer group to improve reading, writing and speaking. ` 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The following structure support this effort: 
Structure common planning 
Scheduled ENL periods 
Professional Development for all teachers on ENL strategies 
School-wide assessment and data analysis, include a focus on the ENL sub-group 
Extended school day through PROSE 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Similarly to how we analyze data to drive instruction, we will also use this data analysis to inform us of our program's 
effectiveness.  In the 2016-2017 school year, benchmark assessments, pre and post assessments, looking at student work 
protocols, report card data, student reflections, teacher reflections, observations, state exam performance, etc, will be 
analyzed at monthly meetings to ensure ELL students are receiving effective services.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  
All students, including ENL students, are scheduled for six periods of intensive support instructive in Math and 
ELA.  Additionally, the ENL teachers provide pull out and push in instructed based on student levels. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A-We are a 6-8 school.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
NYSTILL., NYSELAT data, DRP and NYS ELA scores are used to initiate as well as evaluated the success of programs. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We have the following structures: 
Structured common planning 
Weekly department meetings 
Data analysis professional development 
Google drive 
Bi-weekly Cabinet/Programming Meetings 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students are group by grade level for freestanding ENL classes (i unit).  They are in integrated classes for the 
remainder of the day, including ELA, where they receive .5-1 units depending on proficiency level. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Stand Alone: All ELL students will receive 4 periods of ELL instruction (180 minutes) in an ELL specific literacy class.  
 
Integrated: ELL students will receive 2-4 periods (90-180) of integrated ELL services in ELA, based on student proficiency level. 
  
  
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   The school’s ESL program is designed to develop both the social and academic development of ELLs. Basic interpersonal 
communication skills of ELLs in English are developed through cooperative learning approach in pair or in small group during 
small literacy classes. During push-in, the ESL teacher works with a mixed group of ELLs and English language speakers to 
reinforce the lesson using ESL methodologies. The ESL teacher works in collaboration with the classroom teachers of ELLs 
through conversations and meetings to assist the students in reading, writing and language development. The ESL teacher uses 
guided reading to support literacy development. She provides articulation forms/congruence sheets to classroom teachers to 
reinforce and align language, literacy and Math instruction which fosters academic language development and help students 
meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards. The ESL teacher delivers 100% English in providing differentiated 
instruction using hands-on activities and Language Experience Approach- i.e exposing them to speaking and listening activities 
during the read-alouds, playing & discussing books on tapes, phonics, etc. This includes using visuals, demonstrations and 
collaborative learning activities for the ELLs.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Ms. Elizabeth McCormack, the AP, and Tynesha Pearson, the Testing Coordinator, checks various reports in ATS (ie: RLAT) to 
ensure tests are ordered and administered for all mandated ESL students. She arranges room assignments on the State 
mandated dates, the times, and locations for all 4 modalities for each grade band. 
In the Spring, the parents will be sent a notification, in English and the home language, with the dates and times of the 
NYSESLAT exams to encourage full attendance for the entire battery of exams and explain the importance for a complete 
evaluation of their English language proficiency. 
 
Informal assessments, DRPs, TC running records, On-Demand writing, and other Performance Assessments in Content areas 
are conducted monthly and classroom quizzes and tests are conducted summatively at end of units to ensure steady growth of 
all 4 modalities of English acquisition is on-going throughout the year. 
 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status

a. We do not currently have SIFE students at our school. 
b. Newcomer students receive the mandated number of ESL classes based on their proficiency level. Additionally, the ENL 
teachers meets with all newcomers twice a week to support listening and speaking skills. 
c. ELLs receiving service for 4-6 years receive the mandated number of ESL classes based on their proficiency level. Instruction 
focuses on development of academic reading and writing skills, and will be differentiatied to meet their individual needs. ` 
d. We do not currently have Long Term ELLs  
e. ELLs with special needs will receive the mandated number of ESL classes based on their proficiency level as well as the 
services as outlined on their IEP. Instruction focuses on development of academic reading and writing skills, and will be 
differentiatied to meet their individual needs in accordance with the IEP.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Levelled Text 
Small group instruction 
Books in the Native Language 
Sentence starters 
Online Learning  (Rossette Stone, Ixcel) 
Graphic Organizers 
Structured peer partnerships for support and talk 
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
All IEP students' program are tailored to fit their needs, as we offer the full continuum of services in addition to a literacy 
period built within the schedule. Students are not pulled from regular class for ESL, rather the teacher pushes in. Two of our 
ENL/IEP students are alternative assessment, so their programs are adjusted to meet those needs. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our targeted intervention plan for ELLs in the content areas is to designate specific teacher in our 6th grade as the teacher for 
Math for which ELLs will be programmed. This teacher will receive professional development training through outside 
workshops. Targeted interventions for the core subjects (ELA, math, science, and social studies) include building academic 
vocabulary across the content areas, integrating the fundamentals of language development throughout. In addition, all 
content areas require students to maintain reading and writing journals, and portfolio work to document students' 
growth.  Finally, all subjects utilize technology, such as laptops and IPads. 
  
 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In 2017-2018 school year, we will make the following improvements: 
Provide a Literacy Itensive Period five days a week for strategic reading. 
We will be engaged in the work of MSQI (Middle School Quality Iniative). 
  
Our rational for increasing Literacy supports and instructional time is that not all students are currently reading on grade level. 
  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Not Applicable 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building.

Tutoring in all content areas is available for ELLs during lunch as well as through our after school program SONYC.  They are 
made aware of programs through their dally advisory meetings.  
  
All students, including ELLs are offered the same curricular programming, as well as participation in our after school programs, 
both run by the school (SONYC) as well as Beacon. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
A variety of instructional materials are used including novels, plays, poems, short stories, anthologies, grammar text books at 
the beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels, learner's dictionaries, writing handbooks, current magazines and periodicals, 
dvds, and songs. We utilize laptops and IPads, and the following computer programs: I Xcel (Math), LightSail (Humanities) and 
BrainPop (Science). Additional enrichment materials, such as leveled libraries, are available in every content area classroom. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Periodic Assessments and Performance Assessments are available in native language, as well as access to translation site 
online. 
Books in their native languages 
Bi-lingual text 
Google translator 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

We allocated appropriate funds and make purchases of materials designated to specific grades and ages. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
A variety of instructional materials are used including novels, plays, poems, short stories, anthologies, grammar text books at 
the beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels, learner's dictionaries, writing handbooks, current magazines and periodicals, 
dvds, and songs. We utlize laptops and IPads, and the following computer programs: Ixcel (Math), LightSail (Humanities) and 
BrainPop (Science). Additional enrichment materials, such as leveled libraries, are available in every content area classroom. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The ESL teacher also attends professional learning opportunities sponsored for ESL teachers from Borough Support Office 606 
and PDs from the Office of ELLs and from the Brooklyn/Queens BETAC to learn new innovative ways and research-based ESL 
strategies. 
 The school provides professional development to school staff including the assistant principal, guidance counselor, 
secretaries, and all classroom teachers especially those with ELLs. These PD's are focused on Common Core Standards & 
Danielson's Framework, data-driven instruction and best practices. Most PDs are school-based and usually provided by 
administration and teacher leaders. Some PDs will be provided by the Borough Support Office. ESL person/ESL specialist from 
the Borough Support Office will provide PD to classroom teachers to meet the minimum 7.5 hours of required ELL training. 
Records of agendas and attendance to the PDs are filed and kept in the Administration PD binder. The ESL teacher shares with 
classroom teachers ESL strategies they could use in the class for ELLs. This will give the teachers some support in terms of 
differentiated activities they could use appropriate for the ELLs proficiency level in the classroom. The school distributes survey 
or questionnaires to staff to determine what professional developments they need in terms of best practices, data analysis, 
curriculum standards and instruction. PD Calendar for the current school year is made on a monthly basis: It started in 
September and will continue throughout the school year, with structured time during Monday PD. 
 Weekly department meetings are in place at Redwood to support the teachers' instructional needs. The school ensures that 
all teachers receive help from administration through weekly one on one planning meetings.  
Teachers are provide in on-site and off site PD opportunities including common planning and student work studies aligned to 
the Common Core at the school, and opportunities to attend ELL PDs provided by the Office of English Language Learners. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
All teachers are provided professional development in Restorative Practices, and engage in a advisory program that 
individualizes support for all students. 
  
The Guidance Counselor receives PD from the Borough Field Office. 
RMS will provide professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs of English 
language learners on Monday PD days. A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours 
for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 80 will be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-
teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners. For the English as a new 
language teacher, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours will be dedicated to 
language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching 
strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.  
  
Additionally our work with MSQi will also support all teachers in developing practice in language acquistion and literacy 
support. 
  
These PD will occur during Monday Professional Learning, as well as off site through offerings of the OELL and the Borough 
Field Office.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
All parents are invited to a Parent Orientation at the beginning of their child's career at Redwood Middle School. We also 
conduct outreach through Pupil Path, our online grading system. Students advisers routinely extends invitations to all parents 
to attend Parent Teacher Association meetings. Parents of 6th grade ELL students are also invited to an ELL Parent Orientation 
meeting at the beginning of the school year. 
  
All correspondence will be available in the parent's preferred language.  Translation will be provide through school staff 
(Spanish) and the DOE translation and interpretation phone support. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
PTA meetings have particular themes and address specific issues, like using our online grading system, college preparation, and 
graduation requirements. 
  
All correspondence will be available in the parent's preferred language.  Translation will be provide through school staff 
(Spanish) and the DOE translation and interpretation phone support.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Judson Hamilton, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Upon admission of new students to the NYC school system, parents are administered the Home Language 
Identification Survey and they are interviewed by a licensed-pedagogue with translation supprots as needed. 
Based on their responses to the survey, the students’ home language is established and recorded on the 
Emergency Contact card, as well as eligibility for testing with the NYSTELL.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Language  

According the Home 
Language Report, for the 
2014-2015 school year 
we have 10 homes that 
primarily speak a 
language other than 
English. The major 
finding is the native 
home languages are 
broken down into the 
following categories: 4 
homes where the 
language is Punjabi, 3 
homes where the 
language is Spanish, 1 
home where the 
language is Haitian 
Creole, one home where 
the language is French 
Haitian Creole, and one 
home where the 
language in Mandinka .  

These findings will be 
reported to the school 
community at the first 
PTA meeting, post 
elections and a notice 
will be mailed home to 
the entire school 
community. As a new 
school, we are in the 
process of initiating our 
PTA  

We do not yet have 
access to the Home 
Language Report for 
2015-2016.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.

The pupil accounting secretary, supervised by the assistant principal, will provide each parent whose primary 
language is a covered language and who require language assistance services with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights 
and Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding translation and interpretation services in the first week of 
school via backpacks and at Curriculum Night  

We wo;; post in a conspicuous location at or near the primary entrance to such school a sign in each of the covered 
languages, or most prominent covered languages, indicating the availability of interpretation services. This will be 
posted on the board near the parent sign in desk in the main office.  

The school’s safety plan will contain procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language access services are not 
prevented from reaching the school’s administrative offices solely due to language barriers by providing translation 
services as needed.  

We will share the Department’s website that provides information in each of the covered languages concerning the 
rights of parents to translation and interpretation services and how to access such services at the first PTA meeting.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parents will be adminstered a survey at two points during the school year to gather feedback on the quality and 
availabilty of services.
