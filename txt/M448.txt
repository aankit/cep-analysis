Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our school’s mission statement is: “University Neighborhood High School (UNHS) is dedicated to preparing students 
to become global citizens through higher education opportunities, challenging academic and technical curricula, and 
business and university partnerships.” Our goal is to prepare every student to graduate from high school in four years 
with a Regents or Advanced Regents diploma and with skills needed to be successful in college and career. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

One of our school’s strengths, which makes our school unique, is that we offer students many opportunities to earn 
college credits while still in high school. Through CUNY Baruch College and LaGuardia Community College, we offer 
our students tuition-free college courses while they are enrolled at UNHS. Students can take these classes on our 
campus or at the college itself, thus giving them valuable experience in taking college-level coursework and earning 
up to 30 credits that can be transferred to their future college of choice. Besides our partnership with these 
metropolitan colleges, UNHS also offers Advanced Placement (AP) courses in US History, Science, Calculus, Art, 
Spanish, and Mandarin. Our full-time college advisor teaches College Readiness classes and guides all students 
through the entire college application process. 

In addition, our school has been developing a Career and Technical Education (CTE) program in Hospitality and 
Tourism to prepare students for the college and career world. Freshmen take Microsoft Office Suite and career 
exploration courses that are followed by Intro to Business, Marketing, Hospitality, Management, Personal Finance, 
and Event Planning. Our partnerships with PENCIL, Deloitte, NAF, Henry Street Settlement, the NYC Public Library, 
Gouverneur Hospital, the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE), and other organizations allow us to offer 
various paid internships and introduce students to the business world. 

Our core class size consists, on average, of 25 students and often are taught by two co-teachers, which allows us to 
provide more personalized, individual instruction to our students with the scaffolds and supports that they need to 
master complex material. Teachers work collaboratively to improve pedagogical practice and to increase rigor to 
ensure our students’ success in college or career. Last year we narrowed our focus of professional development to 
improving students' literacy skills, which is done through detailed planning of lessons, units, and differentiated tasks 
and assessments.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Special education students make up 14% of our student population, and 21% of our students are English Language 
Learners. 11% of our students live in temporary housing. We provide these students with socio-emotional and 
instructional support to help them reach their academic potential. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our greatest successes this past year fall under the Framework elements of Supportive Environment and Rigorous 
Instruction. By using our school-wide system of quarterly benchmark assessments, we were able to analyze students’ 
work to understand the needs of our students and to inform instruction. Teachers became more proficient at 
analyzing student data and at developing lessons to support their needs. The counseling department also took a 
leading role in facilitating workshops and mini-lessons to improve school culture and climate. In addition, teachers 
mentored at-risk students and helped them create action plans with student-chosen incentives to increase 
attendance and raise their grades. Last year, we reached 93% attendance, which is the highest rate in our school’s 
history. Our School Quality report revealed Excellent ratings in Student Achievement, Rigorous Instruction, and 
Supportive Environment, which is evidence that we have been successful in offering our students an engaging, safe 
environment conducive to learning. 

This year we will continue to focus on building students’ literacy skills across all subject areas. We have raised the 
rigor of our lessons and differentiation for students with varied learning styles and abilities, and we aim to increase 
their stamina in completing quality extended reading and writing assignments across disciplines to prepare them fully 
for challenging college coursework.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
On our 2016-2017 School Quality Snapshot, we received a rating of Good in this area. Our success in implementing 
rigorous instruction was due to the following structures: 

  Regular coaching meetings focused on aligning unit and lesson plans to the Common Core Learning Standards 
as well as student performance data. During these meetings, teachers refine lesson plans based on the needs 
of the students and include elements such as multiple points of entry, higher-order questioning, scaffolding, 
and re-teaching strategies. 

  Weekly interdisciplinary grade-level meetings focused on reviewing student work to refine the quality and 

relevance of assignments and teaching strategies to meet student needs. 

  Weekly interdisciplinary grade-level meetings focused on fine-tuning lesson plans to align with clear, rigorous 

tasks and literacy skill building. 

  Bi-weekly Professional Learning Community (PLC) meetings included curriculum review, class inter-visitations, 

research of best literacy practices, and action research in designing coherent instruction that led to student 
intellectual engagement in extended reading and writing tasks.  

  Co-teachers were given common planning time to design lessons and supports. 
  College Now courses such as Critical Thinking, English 101, Journalistic Writing, and Public Speaking were 

offered to students in good academic standing, as were Advanced Placement courses in Calculus, Computer 
Science A, U.S. History, Chinese, Spanish, and Art. 

Upon conducting an internal needs-assessment, departments independently found improved literacy to be a common 
need across all subjects. Based on analysis of Regents exam results, departmental benchmarks, and classroom 
observation, we found that students still struggled to complete writing tasks sufficiently due to low stamina for 
writing long responses, and they labored with reading and comprehending extended reading assignments. In order to 
help students be college-ready, we aim that all students be able to read and write at the highest levels in all subjects. 
As a result of increasing literacy infusion, students will be able to build their stamina and to use literacy skills 
successfully not only in the educational setting, but also to extend their knowledge to become more educated citizens 
of the world. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

To increase academic rigor through building literacy skills in reading and writing in all subject areas, which will lead to 
an increase of at least one reading grade level by June 2019, as measured by the STAR Reading Assessment Test.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
On our 2016-2017 School Quality Snapshot, we received a rating of Excellent in this area. In addition, UNHS has been 
recognized twice as a Respect for All school for creating structures and systems to combat bullying, discrimination and 
harassment. Our success in the area of creating a supportive environment has been aided through a number of key 
partnerships and systems described below: 

  Health support through the Peer Exchange Program, which works in partnership with our health teachers to 

 

provide instruction in relevant health topics. 
Socio-emotional support through our SAGA Club and special events such as the Women of Color Brunch and 
UNHS Pride Week.  

  Career support through our partnership with Deloitte Consulting to assist students with professional 

networking, creating websites, exploring college and career opportunities, and familiarizing students with the 
professional world. Deloitte also offers our students scholarship incentives. 

  College experiences during the school day through College Now courses; students who successfully complete 

these courses have the opportunity to earn up to 30 college credits from Baruch and LaGuardia colleges. 
Students gain the experience of a college setting by taking courses with college faculty members without 
leaving our school campus. 

  College and career readiness support through an Alumni "Q & A" panel with juniors and seniors, with recent 

graduates talking about their first-semester experiences at college; a senior panel that met with juniors in 
May to discuss the process they had just gone through in choosing a college; a college fair on campus for all 
grade levels, with representatives from over 20 colleges attending; and special events to celebrate seniors 
and encourage underclassmen during Application Day and Decision Day.  

  At-risk student support, as measured by credit accumulation and attendance, by providing them with trained 

 

adult mentors for consistent outreach, encouragement, and action planning. 
Student support for students who struggle academically or socially through weekly grade-team meetings with 
guidance counselors to create and revise action plans. 

This year, we plan to pay special attention to the social-emotional needs of our students, who often express that they 
are having difficulty in facing challenges and entering the adult world.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

On the 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey, we scored 3.91 in this area due to the following practices: 

 

Significant professional time was dedicated to structured collaboration opportunities. Each week, teachers 
had three periods devoted to working together on: (1) student support, (2) improving the quality of student 
writing through a modified version of the protocol “Learning from Analyzing Student Work” developed by 
NSRF; and (3) creating interdisciplinary curricula.  
Faculty members participated in bi-weekly Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) grouped by professional 
preference in order to support teachers in improving the use of literacy skill-building strategies in lessons.  
  ENL and special education teachers collaborated to make revisions and additions to a list of strategies for 

 

differentiating activities for English Language Learners and students with IEPS, modeling the use of several of 
these strategies during teacher-led professional development workshops.  

  Co-teachers were given common prep periods to plan lessons.  

This coming year, we seek to further enhance our instructional and pedagogical strategies to ensure that our students 
become better readers and writers, and therefore ready for challenging college work. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
To improve teacher effectiveness in the area of student intellectual engagement (Danielson 3C) through lesson and 
unit planning (Danielson 1), which will result in a 3% increase in the Effective and Highly Effective Ratings in the area 
of Danielson Domain 3: Student Engagement in Advance by June 2019.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The area of Effective School Leadership was the highest-rated component on the NYC School Survey last year, with 
95% positive responses, which is above the city average. Below is a list of some of the key practices that contributed 
to our success in the area of effective leadership: 

We implemented Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) led by teacher leaders.  

  We distributed leadership among teachers, who lead the PLCs as well as professional development.  
 

In collaboration with the leadership team, faculty planned special events including, but not limited to, the 9th 
Grade Business Expo, the all-school talent show, Pride Week, and various school trips. 

  Our guidance counselors facilitated grade-level meetings, during which grade-level teams created action plans 

to support struggling students. 

  Teachers who attended external professional development conferences regularly brought back resources and 

turnkeyed their learning to other members of our faculty. 

  Through providing teachers with opportunities to lead and reflect, we successfully created a culture of growth 

and collaboration.  

Although many tenured teachers took on a leadership role, there is still need for developing leadership capacity 
among those who are new to the teaching profession. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
To strengthen distributive leadership in providing professional growth opportunities for new teachers that will drive 
student achievement, which will be evidenced in increased teacher retention and a 3% increase in satisfactory ratings 
on the teachers' School Environment Survey by June 2019.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

On our 2016-2017 School Quality Snapshot, we received a rating of Good in this area. Our success in developing 
strong family and community ties was due to the following:  

 

Increased outreach to businesses resulted in support from local business leaders, including a school visit by 
Omnicom dean Janet Riccio, who hosted a Q&A session with students as "Principal for a Day" and met with 
our PTA to discuss their needs. 

  We developed a strong partnership with Abrons Arts Center, who led workshops in dance, art, and theater 

throughout the year and hosted our annual talent show at their performance space.  

  Our parent coordinator worked with community organizations and the college adviser in hosting informative 
parent workshops on the college application process, completing the FAFSA, talking with teens about sex and 
peer pressure, and identifying and addressing teenage emotional issues.  

  We offered interpretation services for families attending our school events, workshops, and SLT meetings to 

enable non-English speaking guests to participate fully and feel valued. 

  We communicated with families via a monthly newsletter, providing information on SLT/PTA activities, school 

 

news, and upcoming school events. 
In addition to automated phone calls, the parent coordinator called all homes of absent or late students, 
informing parents of their children’s attendance patterns and collaboratively developing a plan for 
improvement.  

  Parents had access to Jupiter Grades, an online grading system that provides consistent access to their child’s 

grades in all classes. 

  Our school had an open-door policy for parent visits. The parent coordinator was available until 4:00 P.M. 

each day and maintained close contact with families, particularly those of at-risk students, to provide 
individual support. 

  UNHS worked with Henry Street Settlement, Project Hope, the NYC Health Department, and other 

organizations to share information about local services for families. 

Upon conducting a needs assessment, we found that parent involvement decreases as students progress to the higher 
grades.

each subject class and peer-evaluate the exams based on a rubric previously created for this purpose. The Inquiry 
Team disseminates benchmark data to teachers in terms of student progress toward Common Core Standard mastery 
. The Inquiry Team provides professional development workshops in analyzing assessment results and developing 
instructional steps to address areas of concern.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. University Neighborhood School in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

University Neighborhood H.S. will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology;

outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community. 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement

surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

University Neighborhood High School in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student 
Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student 
achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and 
programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will 
share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be 
developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments. 

University Neighborhood High School encourages the participation of parents through an increasingly active parent 
volunteer program. Other avenues where parental participation is encouraged are the School Leadership Team and 
Parent Teacher Association. All parents/guardians will be eligible to join. The Title I committee will be consulted 
regarding use of Title I funds in the school during the October PTA meeting and will be involved in the development of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and Parent School Compact. 

 

In order to build an effective home-school partnership, University Neighborhood High School will provide the 
following: 

 

● Annual distribution of a Parent/Student Handbook will be distributed to students during the first week of school. At 
this time, students and their parents will have a clear understanding of the school mission and vision and capture a 
deep understanding of the expectations that we have for our students.  

● PTA and SLT meetings are scheduled throughout the year to assist parents in understanding the federal and state 
academic content and student achievement standards, as well as local academic benchmark assessments that take 
place. SLT and PTA meetings will take place the third Wednesday of the month. The schedule can be adjusted for 
school non-attendance days. Meetings will focus on how parents and teachers can work together to monitor a child's 
progress in order to improve student achievement.  

● A PTA workshop where parents can network and receive training on navigating the New York City - DOE website 
(ARIS, Jupiter Grades & Sharp Schools) will be held during the fall term of 2015-2016.

Begin description here:            
The instructional component of our ESL Title III program will include a Saturday Academy and 
daily before-school program to better serve the needs of all Entering, Emerging, and 
Transitioning ELLs  in grades 9-12 (approximately 35 students). 
There will be approximately 100 before-school  sessions during the year from 7:15 to 8:15 A.M. 
starting October 1, 2018 and ending May 24, 2019, to be taught by Ms. Wright (ESL license) and 
servicing approximately 35 Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning ELLs  in grades 9-12. 
  
During the before-school program from 7:15-8:15 A.M. from October 1, 2018 to May 24, 2019, 
35 ELL students will learn ENL through math content from Ms. Wright, a Math and ENL-
licensed teacher and ELA content from Ms. McPartland (ENL Coordinator).  Students will 
practice reading and understanding pertinent information in math word problems and explore 
vocabulary across the curriculum.  They will solve problems, create data tables/graphs, make 
observations, develop conjectures (infer),  and write written responses to support their claims. 
This will support the Writing Reading and Math Next Generation Learning Standards, as 
students will be required to read understand math information, analyze it, formulate and support 
their claim with evidence in a paragraph format. To support Language and Speaking Next 
Generation Learning Standards, students will watch American classic movies, learn vocabulary, 
write reflections and discuss teen issues using accountable talk protocols. 
 
The Saturday Academy will meet 12 Saturdays starting November 10, 2018 until May 3, 2019 
from 8:30 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. and will be taught by Ms. Wright (ESL- licensed); Saturday 
Academy will be focusing on grades 9-12 math, ELA and ESL for Entering, Emerging, and 
Transitioning ELLs. (35 students).One supervisor will supervise the Title III program on 
Saturdays since there is no other program in the building at that time. The supervisor will support 
and observe teachers in the Title III program. Additional funds from other school funding 
sources will be used to supplement the costs of both programs. 
During the Saturday ENL program, students will conduct a research project on immigration 
using leveled texts and shared reading for challenging texts.  Students will defend their position 
using evidence from articles from NewsELA, PBS. org, and English 3D. They will engage in 
debate and Socratic seminars about current topics such as, "How have different cultures changed 
society?" and “Which is more important to protect in society: freedom or safety?” In addition, 
students will create public service announcements during Saturday Academy that will require 
research on gun control, healthy eating, bullying, cyber-bullying, the dangers of drinking and 
drugs in college, peer pressure, and other relevant topics. The Saturday Academy ENL course 
will also teach English Language Learners a unit on STEM including a science project, 
videotaping their first trial, writing ideas for improvement, and then reflecting on their second 
trial.  This specific language needed to explain what was done initially and what was needed to 
fix issues will help hone specific language skills. The academic vocabulary needed to understand 
and explain the scientific, mathematical and technical concepts will be developed to enhance 
student understanding of the concept and increase the students’ vocabulary. Explaining projects 
to peers and presenting to classmates will enhance the students abilities to pronounce correctly

and speak publicly. Students will  also use Kate Kinsella's Academic Vocabulary Toolkit to 
reinforce academic vocabulary usage in context.  The visual and kinesthetic aspects of the 
projects will help motivate and engage students to understand the critical concepts involved in 
building something with movable parts and experience the excitement of collaboration and 
competition. Common core/next generation materials, including selected Engage NY units and 
online resources will still be utilized as a base for instruction.  
 
On two Saturdays, all ELLs and their parents will be invited to tour Colleges. We want all 
students to be able to envision their future and plan for the best educational opportunities starting 
from the freshman year.  Since  we have an existing partnership with NYU and they organize 
ELL parent information sessions for ELL families with translators and refreshments, we will 
invite the ELLs and their families to participate in these sessions. Teachers will prepare students 
to fully take advantage of such tours and learn college-relevant vocabulary and concept including 
application process, credit requirements, scholarships, grants and loans. These trips will be 
funded by our partnering colleges.

Begin description here:            
During a study group facilitated by our ENL teacher, participating teachers will learn best 
practices and strategies for teaching ELLs in their classrooms.  The group will focus on research 
by WITSI and Writing Revolution, to help ELLs in their writing process. They will use these 
texts as focus points as they compare ELL responses to those of students whose native language 
is English, identifying gains as well as determining the challenges for ELLs.  Teachers will 
develop scaffolds to ensure success of ELLs based on their findings.  The study group will 
consist of the 2 teachers already involved in the Title III program and the Assistant 
Principal. The study groups will occur during four Monday professional learning 
community sessions from 2:45-4:00 P.M. Expected outcomes, which will be turn-keyed to the 
entire staff, are: 1. An analysis of the needs of English Language Learners, 2. Academic 
vocabulary development 3.  Integrating reading, writing, listening, and speaking into every 
lesson and 4. Strategies for teaching speaking and pronunciation in tandem with content.  All 
teachers will be able to incorporate strategies learned during  PD into planning, activities and 
assessments, benefiting  all of our English Language Learners throughout content areas.

To increase parent involvement, we will organize events such as a a workshop in October on 
how parents can help students prepare for the NYSESLAT, a Unity Luncheon in November, a 
literacy skill-building workshop in December, and a February Chinese New Year 
celebration.  We will also offer two college information sessions specifically for the parents of 
English Language Learners. In October 2018, the Road Map to College Workshop will be held. 
In January 2018, the FAFSA/How to Pay for College workshop will be presented by our college 
adviser and translated by our bilingual teachers.  In addition, during the Spring Arts Show, 
students in the Saturday Academy will present their filmed public service announcements and 
STEM projects. Parents will be notified via the universityneighborhoodhs.org website 
(translated), the automatic phone messenger (translated), and phone calls and emails from the 
bilingual parent coordinator and bilingual paraprofessional. As mentioned before parents will be 
invited to ELL-specific workshops at NYU and one other College (TBD) to find out about the 
application process and tour the college.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We use the NYSESLAT, school-made ENL benchmark exams modeled after the NYSESLAT (given quarterly), writing samples, 
and conference notes to determine literacy skills of our ENL students.  The data collected and analyzed from these 
assessments informs UNHS’s instructional plan as to the focus of our stand-alone ENL courses and the type of support the 
content teachers should provide for each ELL.  The language acquisition levels of our ELLs vary from Entering  to Expanding, 
requiring very different teaching methods and content materials.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

At the start of the school year (before students return), each ELL's NYSESLAT results are shared with content area teachers. 
These results are broken down into reading, writing, speaking, and listening results, with a professional development 
workshop given on how to interpret the scores and a review of the exam components. In addition, incoming 9th grade 
students complete a writing sample that is assessed by English and ENL teachers; results are also shared with content area 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

teachers before students begin the school year. Read Theory is used in ENL classes regularly to assess student progress in 
reading comprehension in English. Ongoing professional development for all teachers is provided by the ENL department, 
during which teachers learn how to modify criteria and instruction for ELLs with different levels of language acquisition. In ENL 
courses, students take benchmark exams modeled after all four categories of the NYSESLAT exam to track progress in 
mastering the English language. These results, too, are shared with content area teachers during grade-level meetings in 
October, December, March, and May. Our ENL-certified teachers attend these meetings to share differentiated strategies that 
can help students at each level progress. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Success for ELLs is evaluated through improvement in teacher-made school-wide benchmark exams based on NYSESLAT 
reading, writing, speaking, and listening tasks as well as NYS ELA Regents scores when applicable.  The benchmark scores are 
used to identify areas of growth for each student as well as continued areas of need. For each ELL, an action plan for 
improvement is created and implemented in both ENL classes and content area courses.  This plan identifies the specific 
area(s) of need, such as listening or reading comprehension skill development, and action plans may include differentiated 
listening or reading practice in content area classes, specialized speaking assignments during tutoring or within small groups, 
additional scaffolds to build students' independent writing skills, the use of Read Theory, English 3D and Academic Vocabulary 
Toolkit in individual or small group lunchtime/after-school tutoring, Saturday Academy, library trips, shared reading, guided 
reading, conduct sheets for students with poor attendance or inconsistent work, counseling to discover underlying issues that 
impede progress, and parent meetings.  Records are kept to record student progress and the plan is reviewed monthly within 
grade-level teacher groups.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

After collecting data from the first summative assessments (NYSESLAT exam results and first benchmark exam), teachers 
during grade-level meetings work with ENL teachers to devise action plans for ELLs based on their areas of need (speaking, 
writing, listening, reading). The grade level team works together to devise  instruction that best serves students on different 
levels, and each month, students' progress is reviewed within the meetings to further direct individualized instruction. The 
data inquiry team works with ENL teachers to collect the data and organize it in a clear format so that teachers can track the 
progress of each student in the four areas. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We use the NYSESLAT, and ELA Regents results to evaluate the success of our ELL programs. Last year's NYSESLAT results 
showed us that our students score best in the speaking section  and that writing was the lowest for most students.  They also 
struggle with the listening component, most likely because of loosing focus. Based on this information teachers plan their 
lessons using more audiobooks with listening comprehension practice. In addition, our ELA Regents results showed that 
students scored lowest in both writing tasks of the exam (as opposed to the reading comprehension sections). Because we 
found that Entering, Emerging  and some Transitioning students often struggle to initiate writing in English and maintain 
writing stamina, which results in short and incomplete responses, we devised additional PD on incorporating skill-building 
strategies into all subject area instruction, led by our ENL teachers. In addition, we used the results to inform instruction in our 
Saturday and morning ELL programs, adding additional varied writing activities as well as scaffolds and supports to build 
students' skills in writing. The ENL Department also prepares and disseminated AMAOs tool at the beginning of the school year 
as soon as its available. We use it to determine class placement as well as grouping and interventions for most at-risk areas. 
Some of our Long term ELLs who are at the high levels of risk (6-up) are provided with more targeted interventions and 
monitored closely. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

During individual teacher coaching sessions, the AP Humanities discusses the results of the NYSESLAT and Regents exams with 
ENL teachers to identify areas of need and works with the ENL teachers to revise their curriculum maps to provide more 
concentrated focus on these areas when needed (i.e. vocabulary acquisition, additional steps in the writing process, sentence 
mechanics, revisiting instruction/practice in reading/listening comprehension and writing strategies as well as 
speaking/discussion activities). The principal meets with the school programmer upon receiving the results of the ELA Regents 
exam; when appropriate, struggling students are placed in Saturday or morning classes to provide further support. In the past, 
struggling ELLs, when needed, have been placed in a different ELA class with a larger number of ELLs to allow for more 
specialized small group instruction.   Bilingual paraprofessionals are present in most ENL classes to support emerging ELLs in 
their language and content acquisition. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students are programmed into ENL classes based on their NYSESLAT levels.  Students scoring in the Entering 
range  receive 3 classes per day. At least one is a stand-alone class with students working rigorously with an ENL 
teacher to develop letter-sound recognition, build vocabulary, and develop an understanding of English grammar and 
sentence structure.  At least one class is an integrated ELA class, with supports for ELLs planned with ENL teachers 
during grade-level teacher meetings so that the ELA teacher can support the students in the content area and help 
them develop skills within that class as well as modify the lesson.  Commanding students take one integrated ELA 
class.  Expanding students take at least 1 integrated class with an ENL teacher, while Transitioning and Emerging 
students take at least integrated and one stand-alone ENL class.  In ninth grade, there is a group of ELLs that travels 
together since the overwhelming majority of ninth graders need the same exact classes.  ELLs in grades 10-12 get 
individualized programs based on their needs.  Former ELLs generally have integrated classes.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The programmers, guidance counselors, and the assistant principal of ENL meet to discuss the needs of each individual ELL 
student at UNHS.  Students’ transcripts, NYSESLAT scores, and teacher recommendations are used simultaneously to 
determine the classes the student needs, and each is programmed accordingly.  We are using both stand-alone and integrated 
models.  ELL records and grades are reviewed by the guidance counselors and ENL teachers every month to monitor their 
progress and to provide academic interventions as needed.  Jupiter Grade reports are always available to students and parents 
to help communicate progress in all classes.  
 
Entering ELLs are receiving the required 540 minutes of ESL in three stand-alone ENL classes taught by two certified ENL 
teachers. In addition, they are getting extra support from other core subject teachers with a dual subject/ENL license. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 
Emerging ELLs are receiving the required 360 minutes of ESL in two stand-alone ENL classes taught by a certified ENL teacher. 
In addition, they are getting extra support from other core subject teachers with a dual subject/ENL license. 
 
Transitioning and Expanding ELLs are receiving the required 180 minutes of ENL in one stand-alone ENL class taught by a 
certified ENL teacher. In addition, they are getting extra support from other core subject teachers with a dual subject/ENL 
license. 
 
Commanding(Former)  ELLs are receiving a minimum of 90 minutes of ENL support from dual certified core subject/ENL 
teachers in at least one core subject for at least 2 years after becoming commanding on the NYSESLAT.  
 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
As a small school with only a free-standing ENL program, the language of instruction in all classes is English. All lessons are 
differentiated for ELLs.  The teachers in all content area classes scaffold instruction for the different proficiency levels including 
leveled texts, guided reading, jigsaws, sentence starters, paragraph/essay templates, etc.  Home language supports are added 
to word walls in all classrooms, translated on texts, and verbally discussed with the assistance of  language paraprofessionals 
and bilingual teachers.  All teachers have been trained in ENL strategies and are encouraged and trained to use technology 
to appropriately level texts and provide text to speech as well as audio supports in their classrooms.  All classrooms have 
interactive SmartBoards  and LCD Projectors to facilitate language comprehension.  Analysis of our ELL assessment data occurs 
at grade level meetings, by ENL teachers, the LAP team, and the inquiry team to discover patterns and identify strategies to 
address them in daily lessons in all subject classes. 
 Materials used in the ENL program include English 3D, News ELA, Collections, NY Times Knowledge Articles, a variety of 
independent reading books of varying levels to meet the needs of each student,  and NYSESLAT review books.  Students use 
ipads for research, writing essays, and making presentations (videos and slides). Students use google classroom for peer 
editing, revising and publishing.There is pattern of stronger development in reading and solid progress in listening and 
speaking; students continue to struggle most with writing across all grade levels and proficiency levels.  This has led the ENL 
teachers to focus on literacy development and infusing the curriculum with activities  designed to scaffold the development of 
reading and writing.  These activities focus on using the strengths of the students' reading comprehension skills already 
developed to increase writing skills through the use of recently created, school-wide annotation skills, graphic organizers, 
note-taking sheets, and WITSI strategies for the development of writing.  Every lesson in every content area will be Common 
Core aligned. Teachers have been trained to incorporate reading, writing, listening and speaking into every lesson, and all 
content area teachers receive ongoing professional development on strategies to help build the reading, writing, listening, and 
speaking skills of our ELLs.   
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

All ELLs are appropriately evaluated by our bilingual ENL teachers, Ms. Wang in Chinese and Ms. Lopez in Spanish, and their 
levels in their native language are recorded and shared during C-6 meetings. Bilingual paraprofessionals, when 
needed, provide literal translations of student writing  to content area teachers. 
 All ENL students are offered Regents in their native language when available.  All ELLs and former ELLs are given bilingual 
glossaries for all exams.  All benchmark exams are translated into Chinese and Spanish as needed.  Most classroom tests are 
translated, and all students always have access to bilingual glossaries and dictionaries.

e. 

Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. All SIFE students are programmed for our free-standing ENL program.  They are given additional literacy-based activities 
integrated into the ENL curriculum.  They are also programmed for HLA if they are Spanish or Chinese speakers to provide 
additional language development in their native language and to help transfer skills from their native language to 
English.  Additionally, they receive 45 minutes of instruction during period zero five times a week and are encouraged to 
attend the after-school tutoring program and our after-school Title III program.  Their records are reviewed by guidance 
counselors.  Counseling is offered as needed. 
b. Our ELL students with 0-3 years of ENL service receive extensive ENL support in ELA through a co-teaching model and 
receive two periods of ENL classes to ensure they are getting the basics that they need and are using all four modalities 
daily.  Students will read and write, but also practice pronunciation, recite poems that they will analyze, and perform poems 
they write.  Additionally, a translation paraprofessional is in their classes 8 times per week to develop the transfer of skills from 
their native language to English. The language of instruction is English and the teachers scaffold instruction for the different 
proficiency levels.   Teachers also maximize cooperative learning activities. The use of technology (Smartboards and LCD 
projectors) has enabled our teachers to write and project much of what is said in class to support the reading and writing skills 
of our ELLs.    
c. Our entitled students who have between 4-6 years of service receive instruction focused on the development of reading and 
writing, the language modalities that they struggle with the most.  During the instructional day, students receive ENL 
instruction in all four language modalities, but with a particular emphasis on reading and writing.  This instruction is through 
theme-based units based on and connected to the ELA curriculum, which is CCLS aligned and as teacher are being introduced 
to Next Generation Learning Standards, they will be aligning the lessons with them. The curriculum is supplemented with a 
short story unit, biography unit, argumentative unit and other teacher-created curricula.  This curriculum uses the 
reading/writing workshop model. In ENL and ELA classes, students are trained in reading comprehension strategies through 
the Reading Rewards Program and the Seven Habits of Good Readers.  Classroom libraries in ENL and ELA classes provide 
opportunities for students to read and write about literature at their appropriate reading levels.  In writing workshop classes 
students learn how to develop their writing in stages using the writing process, particularly revising and editing their work. In 
other content classes, teachers use ENL methodology to support student learning.  In particular, they use scaffolding 
strategies, provide differentiated assignments, differentiated texts, and focus on academic language (process words – 
describe, compare- and word walls with native language supports) that students need to be successful in their content.  
d. Long-term ELL (LTE) students have received 6 or more years of service.  LTE students attend AIS for 40 minutes, 3 times a 
week, and all ELLs are encouraged to attend our after-school Title III program.  They receive the same instructional program 
listed above for the students who have received 4-6 years of service.  In addition, teachers are aware that these students have 
stronger speaking and listening skills than reading and writing skills.  They participate in the ENL program with curricular 
activities designed to enhance their understanding and command of spoken and written English.  These students are proficient 
in speaking and listening, so their strengths in these areas are used to support their development of reading and writing skills 
with an increased emphasis on writing. Our LTEs often struggle with the academic language embedded in standardized exams 
and texts, so vocabulary development is also an important aspect of this curriculum as well.  All former ELLs (within 2 years) 
are given 1.5 time, translated versions of exams and bilingual glossaries and dictionaries.   For the English Regents, ELLs and 
former ELLs receive a third read of the listening portion of the exam.  Additionally, ELLs receive at least 90 minutes of ELL 
classes weekly either as a co-taught ENL class in ELA or social studies or a stand-alone ENL class.    
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
We have only ENL programs at UNHS (no TBE or dual language programs).  ELL Students with IEPs (28) receive ENL services as 
mandated by their NYSESLAT score and supported by their IEP as written in their IEP goals. Many of the ENL strategies are 
similar to the Special Education strategies, which leads to well scaffolded lessons with multiple entry points.  All lessons align 
with the ELA CCLS.   Literacy is used as a support in all subjects.   Other strategies used in the ELL-SWD classrooms include 
graphic organizers, differentiated tasks, clear instructions that are also written/displayed, heterogenous group work, color 
coding, vocabulary development, and targeted small group instruction.   All teachers use keywords in native language to 
support concept development.  Teachers and students have access to ipads that are used to translate words or sentences 
when students are confused.   Stronger ENL students and former ENL students are paired with lower-level ELLs to support 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

language and concept development.  All students are exposed to grade-level materials. ELLs are furnished with scaffolded 
materials to help them access the content.  ENL and SE teachers work in conjunction with the content teachers to 
appropriately differentiate all lessons ensuring that all learners have access to the material.   Only four SWD/ELLs are entering 
and emerging, so they take one free-standing ENL class in addition to ICT classes for ENL and SWD.   Special education students 
receive integrated co-teaching services in their major subject areas in addition to participating in the ENL program.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
All ELL SWDs have their needs met through integrated co-teaching as per their IEP.  All students are programmed individually 
to meet their specific instructional needs.  Some ELLs travel in a group for native language support from one another and 
language paraprofessionals.  Additionally, all ELLs and IEP students are mandated to attend AIS after-school for small group 
tutoring. We have only  two beginner ELL-SWD students . One receives ICT for ENL, per his IEP,  and stand-alone ENL classes, 
he also has a bilingual paraprofessional. The second one is programmed for the ICT /ENL Services and a stand -alone ENL class 
and also benefits from the support of the bilingual paraprofessional. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 
targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Programs  for Entering students  include two periods of ENL  plus one co-taught class.  Math for 9th graders is taught by a 
bilingual Chinese math and ENL-certified teacher.  This allows her to assess student knowledge in their native language and 
proceed accordingly.  A bilingual Chinese language paraprofessional supports the 9th grade Living Environment class to assess 
understanding and confers with the teacher regularly.  ELL students are assisted with clarifying concepts and with homework 
difficulties.  The science 9th grade teacher is bilingual Spanish.  The bilingual paraprofessional translates tests when needed 
and translates the word wall.   All ELA ENL classes have a bilingual paraprofessional in the classroom. The teachers differentiate 
lessons to ensure that all students have access to the content.  Content material is differentiated and taken from different 
texts via the Internet and a variety of paper sources.  Students have access to laptops for translation and research.   The 
bilingual math teacher also teaches the upperclassman students who have failed the Algebra Regents so she can address their 
academic and language needs.  She utilizes the Making Math Accessible to English Language Learners from WestEd to support 
language development in the math classroom.    All social studies content material is differentiated and taken from different 
texts via the Internet and paper resources.  Teachers translate keywords on PowerPoints in the native language.  Students 
have access to ipads for translation and research.   All science ENL classes have a bilingual paraprofessional in the classroom. 
The teachers differentiate lessons to ensure all students have access to the content.  Content material is differentiated and 
taken from different texts via the Internet and a variety of paper sources.  Teachers translate keywords on power points in the 
native language.  Students have access to ipads or laptops for translation and research.   Tenth graders receive ENL services in 
ELA and during stand-alone ENL classes.  Eleventh graders receive ENL services co-taught in US History and during stand-alone 
ENL classes.  All beginners and intermediates receive additional ENL services in a self- contained mixed-grade model.  A 
language paraprofessional or bilingual teacher is in all subject classes on a weekly basis to convey misconceptions and 
misunderstandings to the teacher, who addresses these through ENL strategies or translations.   Again, there is an emphasis on 
the use of technology and visual aids in all classes.  Since we do not have a formal bilingual program currently, native language 
is used in native and foreign language classes to develop literacy.  In addition, the native language is used in content area 
classes, when needed, to clarify content area topics.  This clarification happens orally through use of one bilingual 
paraprofessional, bilingual teachers, and through providing opportunities for English-proficient bilingual students to work 
collaboratively with their peers to clarify questions and summarize key material for their ELL peers.  Teachers also provide 
NYSED bilingual glossaries and translated materials in content area classes where available.  Teachers also develop bilingual or 
trilingual word walls as needed.  Teachers incorporate keys words in native languages in PowerPoint presentations, and post 
their PowerPoints so students can use Google Translate on their ipads to support concept development in their native 
language.  Every classroom has ipads for students to conduct research, create presentations, and utilize translation

capabilities, among other applications.    
 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We will be using Read Theory to practice reading and writing comprehension, as well as assess reading levels. Students will 
also use News ELA  that will be enhanced by read aloud feature that was set up an all chromebooks accessible in every 
classroom.  Combining technology and reading comprehension has proven successful in research and our findings agree.  We 
saw students progress based on the pilot group that has used Read Theory and read aloud text feature in their ENL 
class.  Students and teachers liked how reading passages and question types are leveled and differentiated and students 
enjoyed the computer time and instant feedback that the programs provide. so we feel that this component should become an 
integral part of language teaching. Teachers are also integrating SmartBoard technologies and PowerPoint presentations into 
the classroom.  These technologies have improved class participation in writing in class on the board, and in students 
preparing their own presentations that combine graphics and words.   Teacher Powerpoints have the added benefit of having 
what the teacher is saying also written on the board in the Powerpoint presentation.  The combined verbal and visual language 
increases the ELL student's engagement and understanding. We will continue to develop and provide our 'Additional Credits 
Saturday' Explore NY course for ELLs.  This will help them learn to research NYC landmarks and parks, make presentations, plan 
and take trips, and write reflective journals.  The Saturday Program helped the students with English, math, writing skills, the 
completion of projects, and computer literacy.  We will also be offering to our incoming students a summer Bridge program, 
with skill- and team-building activities that will help them become acclimated to high school life and expectations.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Because we lost many bilingual staff members, we discontinued our bilingual program.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are mandated to attend AIS after-school.  After-school programs that are available for all students including ELLs are 
SAT prep and credit recovery in math, English, science, and social studies.  Additionally, Title III is available for ELLs only. After 
school, our Title III program focuses particularly on the reading and writing skills needed to pass Regents exams and the 
NYSESLAT such as reading comprehension, test-taking strategies, and essay writing.  ELLs are in college-bound courses.  They 
are on the bowling team, glee, handball, music, dance, chess, debate, art, cooking, and other clubs.  They take electives and 
are given equal access to all courses.  Students are also offered our College Now and Advanced Placement courses. Our ELL 
students are well integrated into our school community.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Smartboards are used now in every classroom.  Teachers are integrating Smartboard technologies, Google translate for key 
words, and PowerPoint presentations into classroom to support ELLs.  These technologies have improved class participation in 
writing in class on the board, and in students preparing their own presentations that combine graphics and words.   Teacher 
Powerpoints have the added benefit of having what teacher is saying also written on the board in the Powerpoint 
presentation.  They also maximize cooperative learning activities. The use of technology (Smartboards) has enabled our 
teachers to write and project much of what is said in class to support ELL reading and writing skills. The materials for the ENL 
courses are comprised of basal series that include both content and language instruction, specifically the English 3D series, 
Academic Vocabulary Toolkit, extended fiction and non-fiction texts for class assignments as well as classroom libraries with 
materials across all levels for independent reading. Read Theory will be used to support ELLs at their current reading 
levels.   The materials for the English class include extended fiction and non-fiction texts, classroom libraries with materials 
across levels for independent reading in fiction and in social studies content.  Social studies students have both a high school-
level social studies textbook and a supplemental text with simpler syntax and vocabulary as an additional resource; some have 
bilingual texts. Since all our classrooms have chrome books, read aloud text feature has been installed, it reads everything 
from the page if the student needs this support.  We also provide students with bilingual dictionaries and glossaries.  ELL 
students with special needs participate in the same standards-based program as all UNHS students while receiving the 
supports they need to achieve, as reflected in their Individual Educational Plans. For additional support, we will be using News 
ELA, so all teachers have access to multi-level texts on the same subject.  We continue to use our sets of 6 24"X36" white 
erasable boards for students to write presentations on, and then present their solutions or ideas to the class.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

HLA Chinese Language Arts and Heritage Spanish are available for all native Spanish and Chinese speakers.  AP Spanish and AP 
Chinese are also available and have very successful pass rates.  We have hired 3 bilingual Chinese teachers and 1 bilingual 
Spanish teacher, 4 Spanish bilingual and 3 Chinese bilingual paraprofessionals, and 1 Chinese bilingual guidance counselor and 
1 bilingual Spanish Parent Coordinator to support the cultural and academic needs of our students. Staff supports one another 
to translate letters, assist in creating trilingual word walls, translating exams, and phoning home.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required services correspond to the needs of all ELLs. There is no correlation between the ELL's age level, grade level and 
English proficiency level.  We have ELLs at the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, and  Commanding levels in grades 
9-12. Finding books on the students' maturity levels with low reading levels is a challenge.  Non-fiction articles are leveled 
through NewsELA,  and we use leveled Penguin editions of classics as well as Graphic Novels. Students are encouraged to read 
in English in school, but to keep up native language reading for every third book.  All ELLs are required to read in English for 30 
minutes each night and participate in book discussions. Students work in google classroom and teachers are able to post 
materials, articles, readings and assignments that can be modified and translated when necessary.  
 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We do not share a building with other schools. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Incoming freshmen and their families are invited to the Summer Bridge Program, which will be held during the week of August 
28th. In addition to learning information about the school, students will take diagnostic tests to determine eligibility for 
enrollment in our STEM or CTE course sequence. The guidance counselors, parent coordinator also provide families with 
information regarding additional services for which immigrant families are eligible. To better accommodate the families’ 
linguistic needs, meetings are conducted with the assistance of translators.   Students and parents are able to meet students’ 
teachers, learn about high school expectations, and learn about our partnerships with Grand Street and NYU for activities 
occurring before, during, and after school.  There is an extensive question-and-answer period to alleviate parents’ and 
students’ anxieties about starting high school. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Heritage Spanish and AP Spanish are available for native Spanish speakers.  AP Chinese is offered for Native Chinese speakers. 
These are the same language electives offered to general education students and former ELLs.     
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
1.    UNHS provides professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs of 
English Language Learners. A minimum of 15% of the required professional development hours for all teachers is dedicated to 
language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content 
instruction for English Language Learners. For all English as a New Language teachers, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the 
required professional development hours is dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, 
including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English 
Language Learners.  Professional development for ENL teachers, content area teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance 
counselors, and others (including the parent coordinator) is done through weekly workshops during teachers' Circular 6 and on 
professional development days by the ENL Coordinator. ENL teachers and the ENL coordinator are sent to outside PDs offered 
by the DOE, and other organizations to turnkey the training to staff during our department, grade, or whole staff meeting 
depending on the topic. This year the ELL coordinator participated in a 6 session PD on writing strategies WITSI - Writing is 
Thinking Through Strategic Inquiry and shared the best strategies with other ELL teachers. The school psychologist, guidance 
counselors, paraprofessionals, speech teachers, (OT, PT, school secretaries, and all other school staff) are required to attend 
these trainings. PDs are often facilitated by central staff from the Manhattan Borough Support Center and our ENL 
teachers. All teachers have received PD on integrating CCLS into all content areas during regular Monday afternoon 
PDs.  Teachers are continuing to attend trainings and turnkey best practices.  ENL and bilingual teachers attend these trainings 
and include ENL best practices when they present to the staff.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Professional development  provided during our Monday weekly staff meetings includes over 10 hours of ENL Literacy supports 
and is provided by our ENL Teachers and AP of Humanities.  Scheduled PDs include: Deconstructing Complex Texts, Vocabulary 
Maps, Literacy and Writing Strategies Across Content Areas, Reading and annotating strategies and scaffolds and Looking At 
Student Work To Drive Instruction (c-6).  An emphasis on transferring skills from the home language into English for students 
with strong literacy skills in L1 is stressed. The use of cognates, roots, and prefixes/suffixes is developed in all content areas. 
During the first PD day of September with teachers, the AP of ENL distributes the NYSESLAT test results (from the prior year) 
and RLER and discusses the needs of the students based on the proficiency levels in listening /speaking and reading/writing. 
We have adopted WOW! Words (Words of the Week) that have all students learning new words simultaneously as well as 
school -wide annotating strategies that include visualization and color coding. 
Additional PDs on data analysis to drive instruction occur quarterly after the benchmark exams.  Records for PDs are 
maintained in a binder in the Principal's office.  Sign-in sheets, agendas, and handouts are organized by date. The ELL 
coordinator also meets with 1st year teachers who have beginner ELLs in their classrooms and shares stategies that provide 
entry points to grade-level content for every child without direct translation. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In September and October, the bilingual guidance counselor and ENL teachers schedule appointments with the parents of each 
ELL to discuss student progress and current levels; the guidance counselors develop goals with the parents and the child. 
Progress meetings provide parents an opportunity to discuss the goals of the program, their child’s language development

progress, their child’s English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. 
The schedule of meetings is kept in a shared Google doc.  Parents sign-in sheets are kept on file in the guidance counselors' 
and parent coordinator’s offices.  We have a bilingual Chinese guidance counselor.  If a parent needs a different language 
translated, we call the NYCDOE interpretation unit.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
UNHS works to enhance parent involvement with our parent coordinator, PTA, SLT, and partnerships with Grand Street, NYU, 
and Baruch College.  All of our staff, including our teachers, guidance counselors, and our parent coordinator, inform parents 
of school events and the progress of their children via Jupiter Grades, the universityneighborhoodhs.com website, phone 
messengers, monthly parent newsletters, letters home, and phone calls home. Emails are being sent with all the updates and 
announcements to all parents and guardians.  Jupiter Grades is an online grading system that allows parents and students to 
check their academic progress, missing assignments, test grades, and future assignments in each class from any computer at 
any time and can be sent directly to a Smartphone.  UNHS sponsors parent workshops on PTA evenings to teach parents how 
to use Jupiter grades and the  NYC Schools Account as well as other issues important to parents such as mental health, 
depression, and college admissions.  We also have computer and ENL classes for parents. We hold a fun family event bi-
monthly including a talent show, international day, winter festival, spring festival, college fair, and end-of-year celebration. 
Interpreters in Chinese and Spanish are available at every meeting.  Every flyer and letter home is translated in-house by our 
Spanish and Chinese teachers and goes home in at least three different languages-- English, Spanish and Chinese.  The parent 
coordinator (bilingual Spanish) utilizes the DOE translation via email and interpretation unit at (718)  752-7373 when a staff 
member who speaks the language is unavailable.  Translators are present at all events when parents are involved.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Elizabeth Collins, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We use the native language RLER, RCLP report that provides us with the list of languages spoken by parents, RAPL 
and RCON to analyze the needs of our community. These reports along with our knowledge of the students and 
their parents, help us determine the translation needs of our population. This is cross-referenced and updated 
quarterly and annually revised using the emergency cards. Currently, we need translations in Chinese and Spanish 
only. Our other home languages are Bengali and Arabic, but the families who speak Bengali and Arabic also speak 
English. Chinese translations are required for just under 30% our parents. However, oral interpretations in 
Chinese include Mandarin, Cantonese, and Fukaniese. Spanish is required for 20% of our parents. These findings 
were discussed at a staff meeting, during which the RLER with home language preferences and ENL student status 
was distributed. It was also addressed at the PTA and SLT meetings. The ENL department amends the Home

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Staff members are available to translate information to families via telephone, using a "robocall" if available during 
any emergency; we also have an email list for electronic communication. To reach parents who speak languages other 
than Spanish or Chinese, we will dial the language line over the phone service from the parent coordinator's office 
phone. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

The RLER with home language preferences and ENL student status are distributed at the start of the school year to all 
staff members. Our Language Access Coordinator communicates the goals of Regulation A-663 at our first staff 
meeting and explains translation options, including the staff members available to translate and the procedure for 
using translation services via the Translation and Interpretation Unit.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Each family completes a home language survey and the results are recorded in ATS. We send home letters, the 
parent/student handbook, and the Parents Bill of Rights in the preferred language indicated in the HILS.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We conduct an internal parent survey in October and March that collects feedback from parents on language services 
needed for the families. We use translated parent surveys from the Translation and Interpretation Unit's Intranet 
page. The LAC discusses the results of the survey with staff members as well as with our School Leadership Team and 
plans next steps to address any requests or suggestions.
