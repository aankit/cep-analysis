Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Public School 32, The Samuel Mills Sprole School, strives to be a nurturing and vibrant community for academic 
achievement. We proudly adhere to the Common Core Learning Standards, which includes significant foci on 
comprehensive literacy, writing and mathematics instruction. Our integrated, Teachers College workshop model 
based curriculum promotes active learning through reading, writing, thinking and problem-solving. Our focus on 
rigorous academic standards is driven by a deep sense of responsibility and a strong belief in the value of research 
and the importance of focused talk and investigation. In addition, students are expected to be active problem solvers 
and to act as leaders in a variety of situations. Public School 32 is committed to diversity. Our classes are 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

heterogeneously grouped and scheduled to allow for a variety of unique learning experiences. P.S. 32 recognizes the 
special concerns of parents, learners and teachers and aims to create a safe environment in which children may be 
risk-takers. We believe that the ultimate goal of academic success for each student will be realized through support 
from the parent community and through meaningful and appropriate teacher training through professional 
development opportunities. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS 32 has partnerships with many outside organizations including: Arts Connection, Rioult, NYC Green Thumb, NYC 
grow and Learn, Brooklyn Botanical Garden, Trust for Public Land, MyLibraryNYC.org, NY Chess & Games, Play WE’LL 
technologies, Brooklyn Strategist, Pixel, and IVECA. We offer after school programs for students in grades K-5 through 
Good Shepherd Services and our PTA Enrichment Classes. Parents are invited multiple times over the course of the 
year to partake in Curriculum Workshops, Art Nights, Multi-Cultural Celebrations, Diapers to Dormitories, Nutrition 
Workshops, and other school wide events.  

 

Students of PS 32 will continue to use various programs that are characterized by an integrated interdisciplinary 
approach to instruction. The integration of the dance, visual arts, music, Spanish, and science are the hallmarks of our 
cluster program. Our edible garden with its own irrigation system is used by every class. Multiple times a year the 
food grown is harvested and used in recipes in the kitchen for Garden to Café days. A Green Team Committee, 
consisting of teachers, students and parents help maintain the garden over the course of the year.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

PS 32 is located in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn, New York. This pre-kindergarten to fifth grade school 
services a population of approximately 500 students. Due to our diverse population we offer a variety of programs to 
meet the needs of all learners. All of our classrooms, except for our Gifted and Talented, are fully inclusive. We also 
have an ASD Nest Program for students with Autism. The school houses two full day pre-k, four kindergarten, four 
first grade, five second grade, five third grade, three fourth grade and three fifth grade classes.  

  

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

According to the School Snapshot, PS 32 has made significant early grade progress. Based on the information 
collected from Dashboard in Advance, we are working on creating differentiated professional development cycles to 
meet the needs of all educators in order to move them from effective to highly effective based on the Danielson 
Framework. The goal is for our classrooms to be child-centered, inquiry based, and teacher as facilitator.  

In our efforts to be transparent with all stakeholders there is an extensive staff handbook as well as an informative 
parent handbook which contains information on dates, school procedures, programs offered and clear school wide 
expectations.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

By June 2019, 100% of classroom teachers will engage in the creation of Common Formative Assessments in Reading. 
This will result in an overall rating increase of 5% in Danielson component 1e: Designing Coherent Instruction.  

Strengths: 

  62% of teachers say they have influence over school policy in the area of selecting instructional materials used 

in classrooms 

  76% of teachers say they have influence over school policy in the area of developing instructional materials 

Priority Need: 

  Teacher engagement in grade planning and common preps will help them to make the reading work more 
visible. At present, it's hard to 'see' what students have learned or need to learn in reading especially when 
meeting with parents. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 32 in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

P.S. 32 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand; 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community; 

  

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  Title I Priority and Focus Schools and the parents of students served in the Title I program must jointly agree 
upon the use of these additional funds to support increased parent engagement/education to enable parents 
to effectively support their child’s learning. 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; 

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home; 

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; 
conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
PS 32 is currently using Fountas and Pinnell, TCRWP, and Spaulding to guide instructional planning for ELLs.   These tools help 
provide data on reading engagement, accuracy, oral reading fluency, and comprehension, as well as giving us insights on how 
our ELLs attend to and work with the various components of spoken and written words including: phonological awareness, 
metalanguage, letter/high frequency word recognition, phonics, and structural analysis and syllabication.  The data helps us 
monitor the literacy growth of our ELLs over time.  Teachers also use running records, student conferences, and classroom 
observations to assess the literacy progress of ELLs.  This data helps us monitor the literacy growth of our ELLs over time as 
well as tailor our instruction to meet the needs of each student. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Grade meetings, articulations 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our ESL program is evaluated by monitoring the growth of ELL students as evidenced by the formal/informal 
assessments, predictive and state assessments, AMAO tool, and class work. Success is also evaluated by monitoring the 
increase in proficiency levels and scores on the NYSESLAT.  
  
Our ELL students are consistently showing progress on the NYSESLAT (as seen in charts in Part III).  The amount of ELL students 
at the Beginner level decreases from kindergarten through fifth grade, while the number of Advanced level ELL students 
increases.  On the ELA, the amount of ELL students scoring at a Level 2 increased as ELL students move from third to fifth 
grade.  On the New York State Math assessment, the amount of ELL students scoring at a Level 1 decreased as well as ELL 
students move from third to fifth grade, while the amount of Level 2, 3, and 4 increased.  The reading levels of ELL students 
continue to increase from small group instruction as is evidenced by the Fountas and Pinnell, and TCRWP. 
  
These results show the success of our ESL program 
  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

RTI, AIS, small group work 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 
        
   
) The Response to Intervention (RtI) framework is used at PS 32 as an instructional model that aims at prevention and early 
intervention through a tiered system of instructional support.  This includes levels of intervention and instruction that increase 
in duration and intensity over time; as students improve, measured by reliable and valid assessments (both formal and 
informal), the extra supports are removed.  Instruction for ELLs in English language development is provided at the Tier 1 
instructional level. Students move into Tier 2 and Tier 3 if they demonstrate a need for more targeted and intensive academic 
support. This extra support can occur in the classroom, but also in separate settings with instruction focused on specific 
learning targets.  The RtI team carefully analyzes the characteristics of each learner, and views their status as a language 
learner as an asset to draw upon.  The RtI team attempts to build upon the linguistic capabilities students bring to the 
classroom and understand where challenges may lie.  
 The RtI team at PS 32 consists of the building's administrators, AIS teachers, Speech therapists, ESL teacher, SETTS teachers, 
and other service providers.  Each member posseses in depth knowledge of their field.  The team has a systematic approach 
for examining how ELLs’ backgrounds and educational contexts (i.e., first and second language proficiency, educational history 
including bilingual models, immigration pattern, socioeconomic status, and culture) have an impact on their academic 
achievement in the classroom.  To refer any student to the RtI, classroom teachers must fill out a form including data on the 
student and what attempts have been made to have the student progress.  Here is a list of some of the data that is included on 
the RtI referral form: Fontas and Pinnell level, TCRWP, ELA/Math scores, NYSESLAT/NYSITELL proficiency scores, writing 
samples, a description of the amount and type of ESL instruction being provided, etc.  When ELLs are referred to the RtI, the 
team first examines the appropriateness of classroom instruction that is given by the classroom teacher, based on knowledge 
of individual student factors.  The informal and formal assessments are analyzed when examining instruction and learning 
about the learner.  When evaluating data, the RtI team examines how the child performs relative to peers of the same age, 
grade level, and English language proficiency.  If an ELL student is flagged as at-risk or below-benchmark on any particular skill 
or competency (such as in math or literacy), the student receives targeted instructional support to bolster development in this 
area. This support is delivered in coordination with language support services.  For example, when the data shows ELL students 
are below grade level in reading, they are pulled for extra guided reading instruction.  They may also receive at risk AIS services 
if deemed necessary by the team.  The ESL providor of the referred ELL is present during the intervention planning to provide 
input on the extent, if any, to which ESL instruction is needed during Tiers 2 and 3 interventions to ensure the student will 
benefit from the intervention.  The classroom/referring teacher is also given specific strategies to try with the student for a 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

 

specific time frame to watch for growth and progress.  Each suggestion by the RtI team addresses a different concern that the 
child has according to the data provided by the referring teacher.  Teachers work collaboratively when necessary to ensure the 
success of the implementation of the RtI plan for the student.  After the allotted time has passed, a liason to the teacher 
presents the new data on the child to see if progress has been made.  If not, the RtI reconvenes and continues through the 
framework to suggest other intervnetions.  Data drives all suggestions and instruction.  Data is drawn from multiple sources to 
inform decisions, and multiple tools are used to uncover critical information.  It should also be noted that all ELL students at PS 
32, other than those in the G & T program, are in ICT classes; thus, receiving small group intervention and attention daily.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 NYSESLAT, ELA, Math, Science (grade 4) 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Articulations, grade meetings 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

At PS 32 we currently offer the Free Standing English as a Second Language program.  Our Free Standing English as a 
Second Language program is the push-in/pull-out model.  Students at the Entering and Emerging levels of proficiency 
receive 360 minutes of ESL instruction per week. Students at the Transitioning and Explaning proficiency level receive 
180 minutes of ESL instruction and English Language Arts instruction.  
 We utilize the push-in/pull-out model at PS 32 for kindergarten through fifth grade which involves ELLs in G&T, 
general education, and ICT classes.  Students are grouped by NYSESLAT level and grade.  The ESL teacher works 
collaboratively with the classroom teacher on literacy and content area instruction.  The reduced ratio of teacher to 
students allows for small group and individualized instruction. Through guided reading instruction, strategy lessons, 
interactive experiences, and individualized instruction, the students are led to interact, reflect, read, write, problem 
solve, develop and practice strategies, in the second language.  
       

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Not Applicable    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

              Students with a proficency level of Entering or Emerging all receive 2 units of study per week (360 minutes).  The time 
is split evenly - 1 unit (180 minutes) of integrated ESL/ENL and 1 unit (180 minutes) of stand-alone ESL/ENL.  Students at the 
Transitioning level receive 1 unit a week (180 minutes), of which .5 (90 minutes) is integrated ENL and .5 (90 minutes) is stand-
alone ENL.  Expanding students also receive 1 unit (180 minutes) that is integrated ENL with ELA or another content area 
(Social Studies, Science, Math).  Lastly, students who test at the Commanding level (former ELLs) receive additional 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

support/services for 2 years  in the form of .5 units (90 minutes) of integrated ENL with ELA or another content area (Social 
Studies, Science, Math).        
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
       As our school only has a stand-alone ENL program, all instruction is presented in English.  However, we have a variety of 
resources to assist students in their native languages as well - bilingual glossaries, and books in students' native languages (for 
reading pleasure as well as Go Math! and other content area support).  Within the stand-alone program, the sheltered English 
approach is used with a focus on grade-level content area study (science and social studies) and aligned to the CCLS.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

 PS 32 currently only has a Freestanding ENL program, as per parent choice.  Students are not evaluated in their native 
languages.  They do have the option to take the New York State science and math assessments in their native laguages, as well 
as use bilingual glossaries.   Native language materials are available when needed as well.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
 
Our instructional plan for Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) is as follows: 
 
SIFE students will be placed in an age appropriate grade. After orientation, parents will have the opportunity to meet the 
grade leader of that grade, and meet the ENL Coordinator to discuss the educational plan for the student.  The goal is to 
provide students with differentiated lessons that highlight student strengths to support areas of need. With this goal in mind, 
our SIFE population will receive the following support:  
•  Small group reading and writing instruction at the students’ ability level both in reading and language  
•  Participation in AIS  during the day, as well as part of the after school and Saturday program 
•  Teachers will create and review their lessons with careful consideration to the SIFE student need and modify instruction 
where needed 
•  Teachers will provide individual and guided support in literacy and content areas. 
•  An ENL teacher will push-in/pull-out to provide literacy assistance and language development support aimed specifically at 
working with students at their ability levels. 
 
SIFE ELL students will be placed in an ICT or MICT classroom, as all of our classes are ICT.  They will also receive language 
support from a licensed ESL teacher.  The ENL teacher colloborates and communicates with the general education and special 
education teacher in order to ensure the student's needs are met. 
 
 Our instructional plan for newcomers is as follows: 
 
       Students identified through their home language survey, are eligible for testing and the administration of the NYSITELL, 
within ten days of registering.  In the case of students coming from other city schools, a verification of ELL status is done 
through ATS.   Students categorized as Entering or Emerging  are provided with 360 minutes of ENL instruction per 
week.  Students who scored Transitioning/Expanding are provided with 180 minutes of ENL instruction.    
Support for these students is given in the following: 
 
•  Participation in AIS 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

Standalone ENL program and integrated ENL/content-area 
•  Classroom libraries are leveled and contain varied genres. 
•  All ELLs are held to the Common Core State Standards. 
•  Instructional programs use materials that are aligned to the Common Core State Standards. 
•  On-going formal and informal assessments are provided to assure that students’ achievement is periodically measured. 
•  Small groups and individualized instruction is based on assessments. 
 
      Our instructional plan for the Long Term English Language Learners: 
 
The school’s academic intervention team, ENL service provider, and teachers will analyze students’ NYSESLAT scores and other 
assessments to identify academic strengths and needs.  Teachers will plan and modify instruction to best meet the needs of 
our Long Term English language Learners and students who are receiving services for four to six years. 
 
To meet the needs of our Long Term English Language Learners and ELLs receiving service four to six years, we propose the 
following: 
 
•  Analysis of the NYSESLAT, ELA and other assessments to monitor testing history and track progress. 
•  Attendance records are reviewed for interruption of instruction and services. 
•  Scores obtained from the citywide, state and other assessments are reviewed for patterns. 
•  Parent conferences are held several times a year to monitor home study and academic practices. 
•  Teacher assessments, conferences and writing samples are assessed to identify areas of strengths and needs. 
•  Small group reading and writing instruction at the students’ ability level.  
•  Participation in the after school and Saturday program. 
•  Teachers will create and review their lessons with careful consideration to the student's need and modify instruction where 
needed 
extended program. 
  
•  Teachers will provide individual and guided support in literacy and content areas. 
•  An ENL teacher will push-in/pull-out to provide literacy assistance and language development support Student support 
services for Long Term ELLs and ELLs receiving service four to six years is as follows:  aimed specifically at working with 
students at their ability levels. 
•  Pupil Personnel Team will meet to review and revise intervention plans as needed. 
•  Pupil liaisons will serve as case managers to disseminate the school’s committee intervention plan to the teacher. 
•  Professional development will be provided for all teachers on modifying and differentiating instruction to best support our 
ELLs. 
•  Assessments, on a six to eight week cycle, will be implemented to monitor student progress. 
•  Decisions will be made whether to continue intervention services, modify the instructional plan or refer students to the PPT 
team for formal evaluation and other services. 
 
Students who achieve language proficiency (commanding) based on the NYSESLAT receive academic intervention services as 
needed, as well as the newly mandated 90 minute integrated period.  The ENL provider works with the children differentiating 
instruction during the literacy, math, and content periods.  Parents of the students are given the opportunity to enroll their 
children in an after school program and the Saturday school program. These programs provide continuing ENL, literacy, and 
mathematics support for learners who may be at risk of not meeting promotional standards.  These students will continue to 
receive, for two years, testing modifications for ELLs as based on the New York State testing requirements. Testing 
accommodations for ELLs and fELLs include time-and-a-half time (for timed tests), separate location, and small groups.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
We currently have an Intergrated Co-teaching class and 1-2 micro-inclusion classes in Kindergarten,  First, Second, Third, 
Fourth, and Fifth grade; a licensed ESL teacher services the ELLs.    Services for our special education students are provided by 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

our ESL teachers.  The ESL teachers work collaboratively with all teachers and reviews the goals of each student as indicated on 
their Individualized Education Plan.  All service providers work with each child as mandated and required by their IEP.    
  
Here are the grade-level materials teachers of English Language Learners With Special Needs (ELL-SWDs) use that provide both 
access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development: 
  
 Guided reading books specified for ELL students are included with each unit  in addition with labels to make vocabulary 
comprehensible and are scaffolded using simpler sentence structures.  ELL students also read books at their appropriate 
reading levels and participate in guided strategy lessons.    
  
Teacher's College Reading and Writing Workshop (differentiated writing paper, charts with visuals, mentor read aloud texts, 
shared/interactive writing pieces, teacher written and student written model pieces, sentence starters are utilized). 
  
All students also have a technology class, as well as have access to iPads for class projects and support.   
  
Math:  Go Math is used (manipulatives, vocabulary flash cards, projects, Math Journal pages, etc. are used to support ELL-SWD 
students in learning the content material).  GO Math! is a focused elementary math curriculum designed to meet the goals of 
the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. The Standards for Mathematical Practice are integrated throughout the 
program. Students and teachers are supported as they advance from concrete to abstract content through the use of models 
and Math Talk. The flexibility, comprehensiveness, and rigor of GO Math! provide personalized and adaptive 21st-century 
instruction to ensure success. 
  
Resources and materials support our ELLs with special needs.  Classroom libraries are leveled appropriately and include a 
variety of reading genres. The push-in ESL teachers provide shared, guided and interactive lessons that support the skills and 
strategies addressed by the special education teacher.   
  
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ALL ELL-SWDs are placed in ICT and mICT classrooms, receive ESL services, and AIS as needed.  At PS 32, all classes that are not 
G&T are ICT or mICT classes.  Thus, all ELL-SWDs are placed in the least restrictive environment.     
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
At PS 32 we have various intervention programs for struggling ELLs in Math, ELA, and other content areas.  All intervention 
programs are offered in English. 
  
For ELA and Math, all struggling below grade level ELL students participate in AIS and the extended day program.  Revisions on 
students’ intervention plans are modified as needed.  Progress is carefully tracked by the classroom teacher, ESL providor, and 
other licensed teachers providing support services.   All students use technology  (computer and iPads) to assist with learning 
as well.  Within the stand-alone ENL program, grade level content in science and social studies is supported, and during the 
intergrated portion of ENL for Expaning and Commanding levels, social studies and science is supported.   
  
Targeted interventions for the ELA for all subgroups (Newcomer, 4 to 6 years, Long Term, and ELL-SWD): 
  
•  Extended use of scaffolding methods during components of balanced literacy.  Learners are supported through scaffolding of 
instruction that ensures that needed elements are in place before constructing meaning of the whole topic.  Some examples 
are the usage of sentence prompts, charts accompanied by pictures and/or diagrams, vacabulary flash cards accompanied with 
definitions and pictures, etc.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

•  Teachers further develop the acquired vocabulary and content through student conferences. 
•  Small group reading and writing instruction at the students’ ability level both in reading and language.   
•  Teachers create and review their lessons with careful consideration to the ELL students needs and modify instruction where 
needed. 
•  Teachers provide individual and guided support in literacy and content areas. 
•  An ESL teacher pushes-in/pulls-out to provide literacy assistance and language development support aimed specifically 
at                              working with students at their ability levels. 
  
Targeted interventions for Math for all subgroups (Newcomer, 4 to 6 years, Long Term, and ELL-SWD): 
  
•  Small group math instruction at the students’ ability level both in math and language.   
•  Teachers further develop the acquired vocabulary and content through student conferences. 
•  Teachers create and review their lessons with careful consideration to the ELL students needs and modify instruction where 
needed. 
•  Teachers provide individual and guided support in math. 
•  An ESL teacher pushes-in/pulls-out to provide language development support aimed specifically at working with students at

•  Learners are supported through scaffolding of instruction that ensures that needed elements are in place before 
constructing meaning of the whole topic.  Some examples are the usage of sentence prompts, charts accompanied by pictures 
and/or diagrams, vacabulary flash cards accompanied with definitions and pictures, etc.    
  
Targeted interventions for Science and Social Studies for all subgroups (Newcomer, 4 to 6 years, Long Term, and ELL-SWD): 
  
•  Extended use of scaffolding methods during components of content area instruction.  Learners are supported through 
scaffolding of instruction that ensures that needed elements are in place before constructing meaning of the whole 
topic.  Some examples are the usage of sentence prompts, charts accompanied by pictures and/or diagrams, vacabulary flash 
cards accompanied with definitions and pictures, etc.    
•  Small group content area instruction at the students’ ability level.   
•  Teachers create and review their lessons with careful consideration to the ELL students needs and modify instruction where 
needed. 
•  Teachers provide individual and guided support in the content areas.      
  
For all interventions, progress is tracked through formal and informal assessments.  Teachers constantly reflect on the needs of 
the students and redirect lessons and small groups to tackle the needs of the student. 
  
If, however, these interventions do not seem to be adequately moving the student in any of the subject areas, the student is 
then referred to the RtI team.   
  
The RtI team at PS 32 consists of the building's administrators, AIS teachers, Speech therapists, ESL teacher,  and other service 
providers.  Each member posseses in depth knowledge of their field.  The team has a systematic approach for examining how 
ELLs’ backgrounds and educational contexts (i.e., first and second language proficiency, educational history including bilingual 
models, immigration pattern, socioeconomic status, and culture) have an impact on their academic achievement in the 
classroom.  To refer any student to the RtI, classroom teachers must fill out a form including data on the student and what 
attempts have been made to have the student progress.  Here is a list of some of the data that is included on the RtI referral 
form: Fountas & Pinnell, ELA/Math scores, NYSESLAT/LAB-R/NYSITELL proficiency scores, writing samples, a description of the 
amount and type of ESL instruction being provided, etc.  When ELLs are referred to the RtI, the team first examines the 
appropriateness of classroom instruction that is given by the classroom teacher, based on knowledge of individual student 
factors.  The informal and formal assessments are analyzed when examining instruction and learning about the learner.  When 
evaluating data, the RtI team examines how the child performs relative to peers of the same age, grade level, and English 
language proficiency.  If an ELL student is flagged as at- risk or below-benchmark on any particular skill or competency (such as 
in math or literacy), the student receives targeted instructional support to bolster development in this area. This support is

delivered in coordination with language support services.  For example, when the data shows ELL students are below grade 
level in reading, they are pulled for extra guided reading instruction.  They may also receive at risk AIS if deemed necessary by 
the team.  The ESL providor of the referred ELL is present during the intervention planning to provide input on the extent, if 
any, to which ESL instruction is needed during Tiers 2 and 3 interventions to ensure the student will benefit from the 
intervention.  The classroom/referring teacher is also given specific strategies to try with the student for a specific time frame 
to watch for growth and progress.  Each suggestion by the RtI team addresses a different concern that the child has according 
to the data provided by the referring teacher.  Teachers work collaboratively when necessary to ensure the success of the 
implementation of the RtI plan for the student.  After the allotted time has passed, a liason to the teacher presents the new 
data on the child to see if progress has been made.  If not, the RtI reconvenes and continues through the framework to suggest 
other intervnetions.  Data drives all suggestions and instruction.  Data is drawn from multiple sources to inform decisions, and 
multiple tools are used to uncover critical information. 
  
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

This year we are piloting the Spaulding program Writing Road to Reading.  We are also offering an earlybird AIS program for 
additional support before the school day begins.  Based on our data, we believe that each program will benefit our students 
and help in achieving success.  The data shows our ELLs are gaining profiency on the NYSESLAT (the majority scoring Expanding 
and Commanding); the majority are approaching grade level on the ELA.  Therefore, these 2 programs will help our students in 
their continued academic growth.      
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are have equal access to all programs in our school - both intervention and enrichment opportunities.  As all ELLs at PS 
32 are in the classrom with non-ELLs, they are all afforded the same opportunities.   Most  ELLs and fELLs are in a classroom 
with 2 teachers or 1 teacher and a teaching assistant.  All students are offered free after school services through Good 
Shephard.  The PTA also offers an after school enrichment program.  Our school library is frequently open before and after 
school for student and parent use.  In addition, we offer an earlybird AIS program before school as well as a Saturday school 
program. 
All classes take regular trips to support classroom learning.  Arts Connection and Rioult afford all students an opportunity to 
express themselves through the arts  (in additon to our art, music, and dance programs which all children receive).  Our 5  
th   grade students, including our ELLs, all take part part in a Jazz program through Lincoln Center.  We have a school-wide 
talent show, science fair, reading nights, family fun nights, multicultural celebration, Hispanic Heritage night, First Friday 
events with parents, a winter show, a spring performance, and PBIS assemblies that all of our students are encouraged to take 
part in.     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
iPads, smartboards, technology class (preK-5), 
 Resources and Instructional Materials Used to Support ELLs: 
  
Classroom libraries are leveled appropriately and include culturally motivating books as part of each classroom library. All 
instructional materials are age appropriate for ELLs.  Literacy is instruction is presented through meaningful literature which 
actively engages students to participate and apply strategies learned. Before initiating a unit of study, the general education 
teachers and ESL teachers who are responsible for delivering instruction to ELLs meet to plan the teaching points for the unit.  
  
Differentiation of instruction to meet the language needs of students is achieved through techniques and strategies the ESL 
teachers use. Our ESL teacher uses the program On Our Way to English and Treasures to create units that fit the children's 
needs and interestes.     

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

  
Technology is used to support ELLs with programs that are interactive. They have audio feedback and reinforce phonic and 
phonemic awareness instruction. All teachers have access to these programs to utilize with their students.  In addition, all 
classes have a technology period in our lab/library and iPads are readily available for use in the classroom setting.  Each 
classroom is also equipped with a Smart board to be used during all content areas to make the material more comprehensible, 
interactive and engaging. 
    
  
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 
PS 32 utilizes the ENL program model for English language instruction.  Native language support is delivered to students 
through bilingual glossaries and classroom library books, as well as buddy pairing when possible.  Bilingual glossaries are 
available for math, social studies, and science.  Students may also take the math and science tests in their native languages, as 
well using Go Math! in a few languages. 
In addition, school personnel, when available, are able to provide native language support to students during the school 
day.  They provide clarification for ELLs in their native languages in the lunchroom , nurse's office, main office, etc.  
 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required support services and resources correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels.  ELLs are placed into age appropriate 
classrooms and utilize age appropriate materials.  Small groups are conducted with students at the same grade level.   When 
necessary, resources are adapted to be more appropriate to meet students' needs.       
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
    
  
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
The ENL Coordinator assists newly enrolled ELLs who enter the school.  She answers all questions parents may have about the 
school, ELL programs, and the curriculum.   
  
Parents of newcomer students who were determined LEP by the NYSITELL are invited to attend parent orientations by the ENL 
department.  Parent orientations are held on an ongoing basis to accommodate newcomer ELLs that enter the school throught 
the school year.  Parent orientations are held within 10 days of student enrollment to ensure that they understand all three 
program choices available for ELLs. Translators and translating devices are made available during the meeting to provide 
support in the parents’ native language.  Brochures are provided with information on the educational program options in the 
language spoken by the parent. In addition, parents view a video which also explains the educational programs available: 
Transitional Bilingual, Dual Language Program and Freestanding English as a New Language Program.  The video is viewed in 
the parents’ native language.  Parents have an opportunity to ask questions about the programs available and select to have 
their child placed in one of the three program options. Parents complete a Parent Survey and Program Selection Form before 
they leave.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  
Spanish is offered to students for half a year.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
- Teachers meet on a weekly basis to plan curriculum units of study, gather and share resources and materials with the 
administrator, grade leaders and/or  ESL teacher.  ESL teacher will work together and articulate with the general education and 
special education teachers on student goals and progress.   
-Instructional rounds and debriefing sessions will be conducted in order to provide the staff with examples of best practices. In 
addition, teachers will provide demonstration lessons and time will be afforded for teachers to discuss and plan next steps in 
student learning.  
-The ESL Coordinator will attend workshops provided by the Office of Engish Language Learners and turnkey information at 
grade meetings and/or weekly planning sessions.   
- Labsites are created for the grade.  The focus for the labsites will be student engagement, questioning and discussion.  The 
labsites will run in cycles. Each labsite will provide opportunities for teachers to observe student engagement as it moves from 
the continuum of complexity from grades K-5. 
- Intervisitations to labsites are conducted and debriefing sessions will follow with a brief discussion/write up. 
All UFT staff will attend professional development in regards to ELLs  as per CR Part 154. The PDs will take place during the 
contractual PD times on five Mondays over the course of the year lead by the ESL Coordinator, Assistant Prncipal, Parent 
Coordinator, Social Workers, and Guidance Counselor.  Lunch and Learn opportunites are also offered to all staff on a monthly 
basis regarding a variety of ELL subjects based on the needs of staff .  Staff are encouraged to attend PD opportunites through 
the Office of ELLs.  Attended PDs are then turn-keyed at weekly meetings.   Attendance will be taken via sign-in sheet.  
  
-Professional development will continue on the following topics:  UDL strategies for supporting various sub-groups, CCLS 
instructional shifts, text complexity, lexile  level; data analysis; identifying trends and planning next instructional steps. 
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The school provides the parents of ELLs, who are transitioning from elementary to middle school, with an orientation.  In this 
session information is provided to parents on the application process and the criteria by which kids are chosen.  The school 
provides parents with a schedule of all the open houses that are available to them. 
 During September and October the  guidance counselor attends professional development about students transitioning from 
Elementary to Middle Schools and specifically the services available to meet the needs of ELLs.  The professional development 
consists of a description of the Middle School Enrollment Choice Process in District 15, including the three programs available

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Denise Watson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting.

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Language preferences are pulled from the HLIS form every parent completes during registration, through Student 
Emergency Contaact cards (blue cards), and through discussions with family. The preferences are compiled into a 
list showing preferred oral language and preferred written language. A copy of the list is kept in the office; the ESL 
coordinator maintains the list and updates it as necessary, passing new information on with a newly printed list.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
