Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

School Mission Statement:  
 
PS 40 is dedicated to creating a safe, nurturing learning environment. It is our goal to provide high quality teaching 
and differentiated learning to stimulate critical thinking to prepare successful college-bound and career ready leaders 
of tomorrow.  
 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

  

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Our school secured a $1.3 million literacy grant through the Pinkerton Foundation for a fifth year for the 2018-2019 
school year, to provide supplemental reading intervention services for our lower grade students to build a solid 
foundation in reading. This initiative is called South Jamaica Reads (SJR) and consists of the following community 
based literacy partners: Jumpstart (delivers literacy theme based learning activities for Pre-Kindergarten students 
twice per week for 2 hours each session), Read Alliance (supports grade 1 and 2 students in reading and homework 
help 2-3 days per week after school on a one to one basis), Reading Partners provides one to one reading support to 
testing grades students in need during the school day for one hour and after school twice per week for one hour, and 
Literacy Inc. (provides family workshops and workshops for parents, trains parents to volunteer to work in various 
capacities within the school, and facilitates a Reading Buddies program where grade 5 students read to and ask 
comprehension questions of grade 2 students once per week after school). Literacy Inc. facilitates parent workshops 
and trains parents to be volunteers in the school. The South Jamaica library offers parent literacy workshops, and 
invites guest readers to read to various classes.  
 
Summary of Challenges: 
 
The first year of Common Core State Standards (CCSS) testing proved to be challenging. In 2013, in math we earned 
14% proficiency, while in reading, we earned 8% proficiency. In 2014, in math we earned 24% proficiency and 8% in 
reading. In 2015, in math we earned 20.2% proficiency, and in reading we earned 14.6% proficiency. As a school 
community, we have worked diligently to increase our proficiency levels, as a result our 2016 math school based 
benchmark assessment data shows an increase in proficiency level by 7%. In 2016 we increased in both reading and 
math. In reading we earned 17.8% proficiency, and in math we earned 22.9%. Our progress in both subject areas has 
continued. In 2017, in reading we earned 24% and in math 27%. We are very proud of our continuous gains. Using the 
preliminary data available, thus far in 2018, we have reduced the number of level 1s in ELA and Math.  

 

Our school’s strengths are many. The areas of celebration from the superintendent's feedback using Quality Review 
indicators includes that we strategically organize and utilize available resources and partnerships to strengthen 
teacher capacity, support students' academic and social emotional needs in order to meet school instructional goals. 
We have partnered with various organizations such as Read for America, Pretty Brown Girl, Community Affairs 
Department of the 103rd precinct, and the Black Bar Association of Queens to address the school's needs in support 
of improving student learning outcomes. Technology and supplemental instructional resources were purchased to 
provide access and support for increased student learning. At PS 40 we consistently articulate high expectations 
regarding teaching and learning through the ongoing review of student and teacher observation data, the monitoring 
of teacher team work, and through the professional learning offerings that align to the Danielson Framework for 
Teaching and the needs of teachers and students.  
 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The special student populations at PS 40 are English as a new Language learners (ENL) and students with disabilities 
(SWDs).  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Creating a safe, nurturing environment is a vital part of our school’s mission statement, therefore we find it necessary 
to establish a supportive environment for our students. As a result of the decrease in suspensions this school year, we 
learned that our social emotional supports are working. This area continues to be a priority for us to continue student 
social emotional growth and to further decrease the referral, suspension and teacher removal rate.  
 
To continue to establish classrooms and a school culture where all students feel safe, we are instituting the Sanford-
Harmony social emotional support program in the lower grades, and the Efficacy program for upper grade students. 
We will continue to implement the management system called Positive Behavior Intervention Support ( PBIS ) along 
with Class Dojo . Class Dojo is an online behavior management point system where teachers record student behaviors 
on a daily basis that is accessible to parents on web enhanced electronic devices. To further support and address 
student social emotional needs to ensure they have a high self-esteem, positive self-worth and are successful in 
school and in life, we have instituted growth mindset training for all on a weekly basis provided by classroom teachers 
and reinforced by cluster, out of classroom teachers and all support staff.  
 
To support student academic needs instruction is differentiated across content areas based on student needs, interest 
and learning style, content, process and product, as well as by sub-group. To support student future achievement 
beyond elementary school, on a monthly basis teachers implement lessons on college and career readiness.  
 
Student social emotional needs will continue to be addressed through our weekly community building activities and 
monthly character education themes connected to literature. In addition we have an at-risk boys and at-risk girls 
mentoring program, as well as more intensive one to one counseling provided by a community based organization 
and our social worker and school guidance counselor. Restorative circles will also be implemented to support social 
emotional growth of students in a group setting.  
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, there will be an increase in positive student behavior support as measured by the PBIS data resulting in 
a decrease of 5% in the suspension rate as compared with OORS 2017-2018 data with OORS 2018-2019 data.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on the 2017-2018 Measures Of Teacher Practice ( MOTP ) school wide data , Domain 3 was the lowest rated 
area in the Danielson framework for teacher effectiveness. Therefore, there is an urgency to improve our teachers' 
effectiveness in this domain across content areas. School leaders have organized ongoing professional learning 
sessions, using assessment during instruction on Mondays, lunch and learns, and on demand one to one professional 
learning sessions through TEQ online an online teacher support system on innovative ways to incorporate technology 
to improve questioning and discussion techniques to address this goal. 
Based on feedback from our superintendent, across classrooms, teaching strategies such as questioning and scaffolds 
need to consistently provide multiply entry points into the curricula so that all learners are engaged in appropriately 
challenging tasks and demonstrate higher order thinking skills in their work products.  

 

This is our school's instructional focus. 
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

By June 2019, school leaders including teacher leaders will create and implement professional learning on Danielson 
component 3B that builds teachers' capacity in questioning and discussion techniques resulting in 50% of teachers 
increasing in one performance level as measured by the end of year Danielson Framework for Teaching Rubric in the 
component 3B from Sept 2018 - June 2019.

welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

There was an increase in parent involvement as evidenced by PCAR data during the 2017-2018 school year. In order to 
build strong family and community ties, it is imperative to increase community based partnerships and parent 
involvement to ensure student achievement. Parent involvement has increased by 2%. 
We have developed community partnerships to support the academic and social emotional needs of our families. 
They include: Safe Space free mental health services, Goodwill free after school program for Kindergarten through 
grade 5 students, Kid Wise at-risk student counseling services, Youth Tennis program, New York Road Runners, The 
Pinkerton Foundation South Jamaica Reads Initiative supplemental literacy support for our scholars and workshops 
for parents, Child ID program, The Mobile dentist, Pretty Brown Girls at-risk mentoring program, York and Queens 
College student teachers, NY Hall of Science, NY Historical Society, American Cancer Society, Food Bank for NYC - Cook 
Shop Classroom and Cook Shop Family Healthy Eating Programs, and City Harvest. 
Based on our need to improve parent engagement and involvement, in conjunction with the Parent Teacher 
Association and School Leadership Team, we have established parent/family symposiums. This is becoming one of our 
strengths in engaging parents. These symposiums include: Back to School BBQ , Meet the Teacher Curriculum Night, 
Middle School Parent workshops, Anti-Bullying workshop, monthly CCSS Math & Reading Workshop, Family Pajama 
Party Reading Night, Family Math Game Show Night, Parent University, Night with a Prince, Night with a Princess, 
Spring Carnival, and our P. S. 40's Talent Showcase.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  
Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student 
achievement. The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective 
involvement of parents and community in the school. PS 40 Samuel Huntington School , in compliance with the 
Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and 
implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving 
them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to 
actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained 
volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  
PS 40’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through 
school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, 
and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  
In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of PS 
40’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, 
were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional 
input.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 
PS 40 Samuel Huntington School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
PS 40 looks at data from the LAB-R and the NYSESLAT . We also look at the data from the Fountas & Pinnell running records 
reading levels which are completed three times a year (September, February, May) for grades k - 5.  This data provides us 
information about the literacy levels of our ELL's.  The data provides us next steps and ways to help improve our ELLs through 
gainining important data and information about their (concepts of print, letters, sounds, sight words, reading ability, fluency, 
and comprehension).  This allows us to monitor student progress.  Each child's strengths and specific needs are highlighted 
through this assessment and an action plan is created for that student.  This data helps drive our instruction and see the trends 
of our ELLs population.  This allows teachers and staff of ELLs students to see areas of strength and weakness and create ways 
to help improve literacy skills across all subject areas.  By looking through the ELLs data for Running Records we found that ELL 
children had difficulty answering inferential questions.  PS 40 are also gives an 'On Demand' writing to begin each unit of study 
using Teacher's College Writing Project.  We also administer a beginning of the year, middle of the year, and end of the year 
Math assessment.  Data seen throughout the testing grades indicates that ELLs had difficulty with multi-step problems and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

constructed responses.  Students are also given mid-chapter and unit assessments throughout the year that helps guide and 
inform groups for instruction.  
Within every lesson students are assessed to check for understanding in a variety of ways.  In writing students are often self 
and peer assessing using a checklist.  Students are also given exit tickets to ensure understanding of the lesson.  Students who 
do not meet the objective are placed appropriately for small group/individual instruction. We look at what areas the students 
still need help in and focus on those areas through small group and individual instruction. We find that the students need to 
strengthen their main idea skills and overall comprehension. We look at and analyze the results and determine if the students 
are improving in the skills they are deficient in. PS 40 students take monthly assessments through out the year across all 
content areas.  Teachers gear their instruction according to their students needs. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Students are tested three times a year using Fountas and Pinnell to determine growth and areas of need in their reading 
level.  Once tested, students are re-grouped based on their new reading levels to provide instruction on both their 
independent and guided reading level.  The teachers and staff review data and trends in subgroup populations in order to 
address individual students needs and the use of this data and information helps to drive instruction.  By looking over and 
analyzing a students running record, small group as well as individual conferencing and instruction occurs based on the 
students needs.   Teachers are then able to focus on a child's weakness after analyzing the data to help create and form 
groups.  Some ways in which small group instruction are formed is by looking at the students comprehension, accuracy, and 
fluency.  Data is also analyzed based off of end of unit tests in CKLA and GoMath, CCSS, and NYS ELA and Math exams.  Based 
on results it helps us inform and create small group instruction to meet the needs of our ELLs. 
 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our ENL program is evaluated by analyzing data of our students comes from a number of sources.  This includes 
Fountas and Pinnell Running Records, state ELA and Math exam, NYSESLAT, Units of study in CKLA, Go Math, informal 
assessments, and teacher observations and conferences.  The progress that is shown is seen through data and assessment 
information.  Through constant progress monitoring evidence is showing growth in our ENL students through units of study, 
state exames, and the NYSESLAT as forms of assessment.  The information gathered helps to generate reports that are 
analyzed to track individual students progress.  The use of Fountas and Pinnell running record assessment allows teachers to 
monitor their reading levels from the beginning of the year to the end in categories such as accuracy, fluency, meaning, and 
comprehension.  Throughout each unit in Go Math a pre and a post assessment are given.  This data helps us create small 
group instruction throughout the unit, gain a better understanding of where they were before the unit began and where they 
are when the unit was completed.  This information is analyzed and used moving forward and creating new groups of 
instruction. 
In addition the Title I teacher, Inquiry team members, ENL teacher, SETSS teacher, academic clusters, such as writing and 
science,  administer, analyze assessments, and evaluate the results. Classroom teachers use monthly assessments across 
content areas and conferencings sessions to evaluate if the child is making progress. The data from these assessments allow 
teachers to identify the students’ weak skills and re evaluate their own teaching. Teachers gear their instruction to the needs 
of their students.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

After the summantive data is gathered it is shared with the classroom teacher and all service providers to help address 
students needs.  Based on ELA and Math state exams and the standards that correspond to those questions in which students 
were not successful helps form our inquiry standard focus and priority standards for reading and math.  We then focus on that 
priority standard for instruction across content areas.  This is assessed through conferencing, small group or individual 
instruction, exit tickets, and checklists.  Students are given a pre and post assessment (ELA and Math) and based on the 
information gathered helps to create and form our small group instruction.  
Prior to beginning a unit of study (Go Math) all students are given a pre  assessment, followed at the end by a post assesment 
of the unit to see the growth and improvement that has been made.  This information helps form our tier II and tier III math 
groups as well as our enrichment group.  Unit assessments are given in ELA at the completion of each unit which helps assess 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

where the students are and what needs to be retaught or extended for enrichment or re-teaching small group instruction. 
Once the assessments are completed (Math and ELA), teachers create an action plan for students based on the data populated 
to help meet the growing needs of each student.  For math, there is a baseline assessment and in every grade unit 
assessments are completed at the completion of each unit.  Students are then placed in groups based on data for an 
enrichment or re-teach group for Math and ELA.  Students also complete a performance task based on the unit of study.  The 
performance task is based on student needs with differentiation and choice. 
In grades K-2 Fundations and Skills are used to assess students growth and areas of need.  Based on data from these 
assessments helps form small group and individual instruction.  Students are then reassessed at the end of the unit to help 
form new groups for learning. 
Through analysis of summative data from Fountas and Pinnell it helps indicate interventions such as Fundations to be used to 
meet the needs of our struggling readers.  Small group instruction also takes place with the ENL teacher to target specific skills 
based on NYSESLAT, Fountas and Pinnell, Math, and ELA summative data.  Students are given appropriate scaffolding and 
interventions based on their assessment performance. Some of the scaffolds provided are word banks, academic vocbulary 
support, sentence starters, visual support, and modified texts. 
 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
PS 40 uses data from the monthly assessments and running records to identify Tier II and III students. All of PS 40 is involved in 
RTI. The classroom teachers conducts RTI in their classrooms (Tier 1 and Tier II). There are also cluster teachers and out of 
classroom staff who also work with Tier II students. When the ENL teacher pushes into the classroom that have ELLs she works 
with them in Tier II. Tier III instruction occurs when there is a child who needs one to one instruction. In addition, there is a RTI 
team that works with the lowest third who pulls out those students for further instruction. The students who are in Tier II and 
Tier III are identified by the RTI team and they tend to contain ELLs.             
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
According to the NYSESLAT 4 students were expanding, 3 were transitioning, 5 was emerging and  0 entering. Additionally, PS 
40 has 7 students at the commanding level.  On the NYSITELL there are 3 new ELLs in Kindergarten.  2 are Entering and 1 is 
Transitioning. In fourth grade there is 1 new ELL at the Transitioning level.  Two are at the Entering level and one is at the 
Emerging level.  The ENL teacher differentiates her instruction based on the needs of the students and what is indicated by the 
NYSITELL and/ or the NYSESLAT. Students are grouped according to their language proficiency, language needs, and grade 
level.  Based on CR Part 154's mandated minutes, services are determined for ENL instruction (Intergrated/Stand-Alone).  To 
help the ENL students in grades K-5, we use instructional strategies centered on Phonemic Awareness, the use of multimedia 
materials, multicultural literature, graphic organizers, accountable talk, the use of maps and visuals, questioning and 
discussion, and class presentations. The ENL teacher also meets with the classroom teachers to ensure that her lessons match 
the lessons that are being taught by the classroom teacher when she pushing in for integrated services.  The ENL teacher 
shares best practices during those meetings so that they can apply it when they are teaching. In grades 3-5 most students are 
at the transitioning, expanding, and commanding levels.  The focus will be on reading and writing, in order to help students 
move to the commanding level, which will help prepare students for the NYS ELA exam.  
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Once a month during Professional Development and Learning, the ENL teacher presents strategies to help all classroom 
teachers of ELLs.  Professional Development includes math, vocabulary, reading, and writing strategies that will help 
accommodate and meet the needs of our ELLs.  The ENL teacher also presents NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, RLAT, and other ENL 
assessment findings to school staff (classroom teachers, administrators,  and coaches) to help identify instructional goals for 
ELLs as well as showing the progress that has been achieved by ELLs.  The ENL teacher each month also presents Professional 
Learning opportunities during lunch periods each month.  Professional Development is created to accommodate the needs of 
our ELLs based on current data trends, assessments, and conferencing.  Lessons are then planned and students are grouped 
according to their individual needs in the different modalities.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

 

Also, during our Saturday Academy ENL students will have more individualized instruction to help meet their needs across all 
modalities.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

PS 40 has a clear vision that includes high expectations for ELL student achievement supported by a purposeful plan of 
action leading to college and career readiness. We have school wide shared expectation and beliefs about student 
learning. We emphasize a culture of high expectations for ELLs, teachers and parents. PS 40 continuously monitors ELL 
student progress and adjust their instructional planning based on a wide variety of evidence and data. We have 
ongoing assessments to monitor student progress. We use assessment data to plan instruction and use rubrics that 
integrate ELA and ENL performance standards in writing. Teachers of ELLs know their ELL population and their 
individual needs based on the meetings the ENL teacher has with the classroom teachers. Teachers make connection 
between the Children First concept of accountability for ELL outcomes , progress reports and inquiry teams to clarify 
the work with data. The Core Knowledge Language Arts Program are aligned with the Common Core Standards and is 
research based. Teachers use differentiated instructional strategies and use adequate materials to address needs of 
all students.  PS 40 values parent and community involvement and takes active steps to ensure that they are part of 
the school's culture. The goal of our ENL program is to foster full English proficiency in a supportive classroom 
environment. ENL instruction is provided to all ELL students and former ELL students who received the Commanding 
proficiency on the NYSESLAT  in grades K – 5 using a push-in model (Integrated).  In the Integrated model the ENL 
teacher, who is dually certified in Comman Branches and ENL, works with ELLs in collaboration with general education 
classroom teachers to provide language acquisition and vocabulary support.   Integrated ENL instruction builds English 
language skills through content area instruction. Integrated ENL instruction include content area subject matter and 
English language development using ENL strategies.  There is a common preparation time between the 2 teachers so 
that they can collaborate to create lesson plans.  English is the language of instruction.  The ELLs are placed in one 
class per grade so that the ENL teacher can easily service them. The classes are hetergenous.  There is an ELA block 
across grade levels in the school.   Stand Alone ENL instruction builds English language skills through listening, 
speaking, reading, and writing instruction while using ENL strategies.  Stand-alone instruction includes vocabulary 
support, foundational skills, comprehension strategies, and language acquistion.  Entering and Emerging ELLs 
requiring stand-alone minutes are grouped no more than two consecutive grade levels together (ex. 1-2, 4-5).

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The school ensures the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided by strategically planning the placement of all 
entitled students and carefully scheduling the program to ensure compliance with the CR Part 154.2 mandates for ENL.The ENL 
students who are at the Entering level will receive 180 minutes of standalone ENL instruction and 180 minutes of integraded 
ENL/ELA instruction giving them a total of 360 minutes per week.  The Emerging students will receive 90 minutes of standalone

ENL instruction and 270 minutes (180+90) of integraded ENL/ELA instruction giving them a total of 360 minutes per week.  The 
ENL students at the Transitioning level will receive 180 minutes of ENL/ELA instruction with a total of 180 minutes per week in 
the integrated setting.  The Expanding students will receive 180 minutes of ENL/ELA instruction with a total of 180 minutes per 
week in conjunction with the classroom teacher through the use of integraded ENL/ELA instruction.  The students who are at 
the Commanding level will receive 90 minutes of ENL/ELA instruction per week in integrated instruction and will be serviced 
for 2 years. The ENL teacher pushes into the classrooms every day to provide support. ENL/ELA instruction is delievered in 
consultation with each classroom teacher to support our ENL student population.  There is a 25% Native language support in 
the classrooms and in the ESL classrooms in terms of language glossaries and books in the students' native languages. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
When the ENL teacher pushes in she uses the teacher's curriculum maps to align instruction. When she pushes in she pushes 
in during ELA, Math, social studies, and science time. All instruction is in English. However, students receive Native Langauge 
support in their classrooms and in the ENL teacher's classroom, through the use of Native Language libraries and glossaries in 
ELA and Math.  Other instructional materials include picture support, leveled classroom libraries, visuals, books on tape, 
ReadingEggs and EggExpress computer program.  The ENL library and some classroom libraries have Native Language 
books.  Students in grades K-5 use the Core Knowledge Language Arts (CKLA) program. The lessons are designed to 
encompasses all four modalities ( speaking, listening, reading and writing), which support second language development. The 
Core Knowledge program are aligned with the Common Core Standards. The classroom teacher also assigns a buddy who 
speaks the same language as the ENL student.    In addition, ENL instruction is also delieverd using ENL strategies, hands-on 
activities, visuals, role playing, and differentiated instruction.  The ENL teacher pushes  into the classrooms that have the ELL 
students. The ENL teacher meets with the classroom teacher during a common preparation periods to ensure that the ELLs 
instructional needs are being met during instruction.The ENL teacher co teaches with the classroom teacher.        
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

To ensure that the ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language PS 40 has fluent Bengali, Haitian, French and 
Spanish speakers on site.   We also use The Big Word and the Translation and Interpretation Unit throughout the year.     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

The students are heterogeneously grouped with mixed proficiency levels within one grade level. When the ENL teacher creates 
the schedule the teacher adds up the instructional minutes to ensure that mandates are being met. The ENL program helps 
our students to develop grade appropriate skills, concepts and level of understanding of English. The program emphasizes 
integration of four language modalities: listening, speaking, reading and writing. The ENL teacher differentiates her instruction 
based on the needs of the students and what is indicated by the NYSITELL and/ or the NYSESLAT. To help SIFE students we will 
use instructional strategies centered on Phonemic Awareness, the use of multimedia materials, the use of multicultural 
literature, graphic organizers, accountable talk, the use of maps and visuals. Students work in cooperative groups and the 
teacher uses the method of scaffolding to aid the students in understanding concepts. Scaffolding is an essential part to 
learning. It allows the teacher to model, bridge, contextualize and build the students’ background knowledge. The ENL teacher 
also conferences with the students and collaboratively plans with the classroom teachers. The teacher also has the students in 
flexible groups so that the students are working with different types of children. For the newcomers we use explicit 
instruction. Utilizing the research based  Core Knowledge Program, the newcomers receive extra support with practicing skills 
that help prepare them for the ELA State Exam. Other strategies to be emphasized in order to improve the language 
acquisition of ELLs are: building and activating background knowledge, the integration of children’s native language and 
cultural backgrounds, values and beliefs, the use of manipulatives to facilitate concrete experiences to help students create a 
context for what they are learning, emphasizing use of realia, using accountable talk to support language development, use of

personal word walls (content and sight word based), assisting students in understanding each component in the writing 
process, and the use of rubrics to self-asses students’ progress. Language development will be increased and assessed and the 
use of vocabulary as integrated into the content areas of literacy, mathematics, science, social studies, technology, etc. The 
ENL students will learn to look critically at the world around them through studying original documents, doing research, and 
investigation. In addition, PS 40 has reading materials that are written in different languages to help the student gain 
knowledge while learning English. PS 40 is also currently using technological suppport for ELLs such as MyOn and 
ReadingEggs.  Fundations will be used as an intervention to close the learning gaps of scholars in Pre-K-2 grade and for special 
education self contained classes.  However, if there are students who are in grades 3-5 who need fundations then a special 
group will be formed to help them close the gap.The ELL students who are developing will receive resource room and are 
targeted at-risk by the Data Inquiry Team, as well as attending after school. To promote vocabulary development the ENL 
teacher will utilize a variety of strategies such as the Total Physical Response where students apply actions with oral language 
to concepts and procedures. The ENL teacher will have students perform the action while chorally saying the word or sentence 
related to it. Another strategy is using sentence frames. Sentence frames support students’ use of academic vocabulary and 
language structures. The ENL teacher provides students with sentence frames for oral and written responses to questions. All 
assignments in the ENL/ELA classroom are Tiered and are designed to have varied levels of depth, complexity, and 
abstractness companied with varied degrees of scaffolding, support, and direction depending on students and task. Tiered 
assignments allow students to work on similar tasks that provide individual challenges. In all assignments the ENL students will 
be asked hierarchy of questions that progress from less to more complex. Students who are below grade level will focus on 
building knowledge and comprehension as a foundation. The students who are on grade level will work on applying and 
analyzing information learned. The students above level will work towards synthesizing and evaluating. The below level 
students contribute to the group’s knowledge because their questions provide the basis for what everyone needs to know. The 
students on grade level apply and analyze information learned and above grade level students are encouraged to think about 
their own thinking.The former ELLs will be able to take advantage of the resources that are found in their classroom. Students 
will be engaged in all instructional strategies that the current ELLs are utilizing since they are in the same classroom.  Current 
and Former ELLs will receive support from the ENL teacher.  They will receive support from RTI team if necessary and will be 
able to have testing sccommodations for two years for the state exams. Former ELLs are invited to the ELA and Math after 
school programs so that they can do well on the state exams. 
They will receive support from RTI team if necessary and will be able to have testing sccommodations for two years for the

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Students who have special needs will also receive extra services as per their IEP. For example, they may receive ENL and RTI 
services.  These students are given a variety of remedial aid to ensure that they meet the Common Core Learning Standards. 
Fundations, Core Knowledge Language Arts,  Mathletics, MyOn, and ReadingEggs  are programs that PS 40 provides. The 
students who have IEPS are involved in the RTI process. In addition students are assigned literature and non fiction text on 
their appropriate reading level and prompted to apply grade level concepts according to Common Core Learning Standards. 
There is a use of multi-sensory learning approach that incorporates visual, auditory and tactile activities. Graphic organizers 
are also used to provides students opportunities to organize their thinking in different ways.  We provide additional 
presentations using repetition, paraphrasing and modeling. We allow opportunities for movement.     
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
At PS 40 all classes on each grade level adopt a similar schedule to allow students an opportunity to have access to a general 
education classroom during subjects identifies as a "student strength," ie mainstreaming. Tasks and assignments are modified 
so that SWD's participate in the general education curriculum and are prepared to meet CCLS.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

In addition to the classroom teacher there are content area specialists, for example, math, ELA/Social Studies and Science 
coaches and cluster teachers, that push into the classroom to give extra support. PS 40 provides after school programs that 
focus on reading and math skills. These skills are aligned with the NYS CCLS  and prepare the students for the state exams.  For 
our early childhood students are in an after school program called Reading Alliance.  Reading Alliance provides students in 
grades 1 and 2 with In addition, when there is the Title III after school/Saturday program for ELLs all ELLs are targeted. The ELL 
students who are in grades K-5 will be participating in the ENL after school/Saturday program . All of the ELL students in all of 
the ELL subgroups are targeted and invited to participate in the Title III program.   PS 40 also uses the Fundations Program for 
grades Pre-K through second grade.  MyOn and Mathletics are for students in grades K-5. Students are also targeted by the RTI 
team and they pull those students out for further instruction.  Also, the Title III Immigrant Fund was used for ELLs and 
Immigrant students and families on Saturday's.  The language of instruction was English.  All ELLs students who were in grades 
K-5 and those of Immigrant families were invited to join the program.  Students worked on a computer based Literacy Program 
called ReadingEggs (K-2) and ReadingEggspress (3-5).  Students also used LEGO program to create stories both written and 
orally using fiction and non-fiction ideas.  Students had access to visuals, picture support, sentence frames and sentence 
starters for speaking and writing.  In addition, students social and emotional needs were met when NYC Children's Theatre 
came in to work with students on empowering themselves to stand up to bullying and learning lessons through stories.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

The use of Teacher's College Writing Program will be added for the upcoming school year.  This program will help enhance and 
enrich our students writing skills.  It will allow for teachers to gain a better understanding of where students are and where 
they need to be through the use of rubrics, checklists, peer and self assessment, and conferencing.  This will help create small 
group instruction and explicit conferences.  Teacher's College Writing Program will help students become more prepared for 
state ELA exams which are linked to Common Core State Standards.  
The ENL Saturday program will be based on data trends from the NYSESLAT and state ELA and Math exams to help ENL 
students continue to succeed.  The data found will help create small group instruction both in the classroom and through the 
Saturday program. 
 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs; such as Title III, ELA and Math after school programs and any other extra 
curricular activities that the school offers. All notices that invite ELLs are translated into their home language.  ENLs are also 
afforded technology in their own classroom and the technology room.  Resource Room, Speech, Occupational Therapy, 
Physical Therapy, Counseling to ENLs in our building when appropriate.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The instructional materials used to support each sub group are glossaries, native language books and Core Knowledge. State 
exams are ordered in the student's native language across content areas. The classroom teacher uses MyOn, Go Math! and 
Mathletics in the classroom. Computer programs available for ENLs include: ReadingEggs/ReadingEggspress and 
Starfall.  Picture dictionaries (Spanish, French, Begali) are also used, and language skills games (Spanish) are available for 
ENLs.  Students who have internet access can also work on these programs at home.  The Title I teacher also comes into the 
classrooms to support the classroom teacher in Fundations.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is given to the ELLs in the ENL program by having glossaries, native language books  and teachers who 
speak the languages of our students. 
Native language support is delivered by teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, occupational therapists, and 
physical therapists who speak these different languages.  Home Language is assessed for Spanish speaking students through 
the use of the LAB-R.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Services and supports correspond to ELLs in K-5. SETSS, speech, ENL, RTI teachers will differentiate grade level curriculum to 
meet the needs of the ENLs. All instruction is aligned to the curriculum maps and Common Core Standards.  Our Kindergarten, 
first, and second grade ENLs use the Fundations program to learn about and effectively use information about letters, sounds 
and words.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Each school provides the staff needed to support student needs.  Our building hosts two separate schools.  We make sure all 
the students at P.S. 40 are serviced and their needs are all met by the ENL teacher when working with students an integrated 
classroom or stand alone setting.  Students linguistic needs are met based on data received through the NYSITELL and 
NYSESLAT.  Based on their responses of the students determines the plan of action for that student.  Scaffolds (sentence 
starters/frames), strategies (listening on audio tape/watching a video), words in their home language and English, practice 
through conversation, repetition are used to assist students to meet their linguistic needs.  Data is also analyzed from unit 
reading assessments, Go Math, writing tasks, ELA and Math state tests.  This data helps when the ENL teacher and classroom 
teacher meet at least once a week to discuss where the student is and where they need to be.  Strategies and different 
approaches are also discussed with the classroom teacher and are then being implemented.  The ENL teacher and classroom 
teacher discuss feedback with how the ENL students are doing and if the strategies are working.  Also discussed are next steps 
to be taken with the ENL students.  This helps us meet the needs of the ENL student academically.  Socioemotionaly the ENL 
teacher meets daily with ENL students.  When/If the need arises the ENL teacher makes the proper contact (at risk counselor, 
administration, guidance counselor) as support and guidance for the child, family, and teacher(s) to help meet the needs of our 
ELLs socioemotionally.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
To ensure that newcomers are acclimated to the school parents are invited with their child to come in and view the classroom 
and meet the teacher. With assistance from the Parent Coordinator new students and parents are invited to tour the building 
with their children. The ELLs can meet their buddy partner so that the Affective filter is lowered. This will lower the anxiety and 
stress they might feel when they first come to the school.  PS 40 also hosts the Back To School BBQ and invites all new and 
current students with their parents to come and participate in school activities.  All school personnel are invited to partake in 
the Back to School BBQ.  At Kindergarten registration, the ESL teacher, Parent Coordinator, and other school personnel make 
sure registration is being done correctly. Translators are available to assist through the Language and Transition Unit or in-
school staff members. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Currently PS 40 does not have any language electives offered to ELLs.       
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

PS 40 does not currently have a Dual Languge Program.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
During the 2017-2019 school years, the ENL teacher plans to attend a variety of ENL workshops from the Queens Borough 
South Field Support Team (EILI series, EDAT, Nuts and Bolts, NYSESLAT Review, LAP review) that will better prepare her in 
dealing with current issues ELLs face in today’s society.   Ms. Fisher receives emails from the Queens Borough South Field 
Support Team office that shares the upcoming PLs.  She plans to attend several throughout the year. In addition, the ENL 
teacher will meet with the teachers of the students she services and turn key the information learned to them and other staff 
members monthly. The ENL teacher also hosts Lunch and Learns monthly starting in October and hosts professional 
development to teachers through out the year. Agenda and sign in sheets are kept in the Data Binder. Some of the 
professional development opportunities that will be given to the staff will be hosted by Ms. Fisher are on identifying the five 
different proficiency levels, characteristics of each stage, and what strategies to use for any level of English Proficiency.  This 
workshop is to help teachers of ELLs to use assessment and scaffolding to support the five stages of language acquisition.  Also, 
pedagogy and all staff members will be given information about the different ways to communicate with limited English 
proficient families (Language and Translation Unit - Number/Written communication, The Big Word, IEP translations).  This 
information will help staff members with/when communicating with families whose first language may not be English.  This 
information will be printed and given to each staff member, and copies will be left in the office.  Other monthly PLs will include 
professional development on different writing strategies (narratives, opinion, and expository writing).  This is important 
because according to the CCSS RL3.3 and RL 4.3, it is necessary for students to be able to describe in depth a character, setting, 
or event in a story or drama, drawing on specific details in the text.  Expository writing is also important for students to be able 
to identify and understand how information is presented.  Students also need to write about a non-fiction text on the state 
exam.  ENL strategies, sentence starters, and sentence frames will be used throughout the PL.  Other strategies that will be 
emphasized during monthly PL and Lunch and Learns include use of content/academic vocabulary, everyday words, and 
questioning and discussion techniques.  We want to provide ENL students with different tools to succeed which include 
personal word walls (everyday sight words), content/academic vocabulary word walls.  This is important because it 
individualizes curriculum for our students and has them taking ownership of their own learning.  One of the four modalities of 
an ENL student is speaking.  Different question and discussion techniques will be shown to staff members to experiment and 
try.  This is important because it allows for students to communicate in different ways (writing, think-pair-share) or in a smaller 
group then to the whole class.  A PL on strategies in math.  All ENLs will be taking the state math exam.  Students have to show 
how they got their answers and explain it.  This workshop models for the teachers other ways for the students to show and 
explain their answers.  There will also be a PL on reading comprehension strategies.  There are many reading passages on both 
the ELA state exam and the NYSESLAT.  These strategies will aid the ENLs in these exams since they are common core 
aligned.  As the NYSESLAT gets closer there will be a PL on the NYSESLAT.  Teachers will learn strategies that will help their ENL 
students on the upcoming test.  Students can use those same standards on the state exams.  There will also be a year in review 
PL.  This will help support and inform the PL cycles for next year by highligting what works and didn't work, what can be gone 
over in more depth or next steps, as well as feedback.The assistant principals, common branch teachers, subject area teachers, 
paraprofessionals guidance, special eduction teachers, ENL teacher, psychogists, occupational/physical therapists and speech 
therapists are sent  to professional development on ELL instruction. All staff members are also invited to all Lunch and Learns 
that the ESL teacher hosts throughout the year. Staff are also sent to ELL workshops and turn keys the information to their 
colleagues in the grade.  During the common planning prep period the classroom teacher discusses with the ENL teacher what 
strategies they are working on and what the strategies that need to be re addressed are. This is to ensure that what is being 
done in the ENL classroom reflects what is being taught in the classroom. In addition. the ENL teacher meets with the teachers 
of ELLs each month to share best practices.  
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

All teachers and administrators will receive a  minimum of 15% of the required professional development hours for all teachers 
prescribed by CR Part 154.2 must be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching 
strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.  The ENL teacher will receive, a 
minimum of 50% of the required professional development hours to language acquisition in alignment with core content area 
instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for 
English language learners.In addition, the ENL teacher will turn key any information learned at those professional learning 
sessions at the lunch and learns that she hosts monthly. Ms. Fisher also keeps a log of attendees from her Lunch and Learns in 
her Data Binder. The ENL teacher also researches best practices for her beginning and advanced ELL students. This reseach 
occurs every third or fourth Monday of each month and is shared with staff members . The Assistant Principal also attends 
mandated ENL workshops. This information is shared with the ENL teacher who also turn keys the information to staff 
members so they can implement in their classrooms. All PD agendas, handout and sign in sheets are kept in the main office for 
future reference.       
 
 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
During the school year the ENL teacher hosts several workshops for parents of ELLs.  Letters are translated into their home 
language using the Translations and Interpretations Unit so that they can attend. They are given plenty of notice to attend the 
workshop. If the parent can not attend that day then the ENL teacher will meet with them another time. The ENL teacher 
shares with the parents how their children are progressing and what they can do at home. If a parent  needs a translator PS 40 
will provide one through an over the phone interpreter (Translation and Interpretation Unit, in-house staff member).  There 
are many staff members who speak many languages, such as, Spanish, Bengali, French and Haitian Creole. Also the ENL 
teacher can use the Translations and Interpretations Unit which has translators for over 200 languages.  All parent meeting 
have an agenda that is translated using the T & I Unit or is translated in Spanish by a staff member. There is a sign in sheet. All 
the information is stored in the ENL's Data Binder. During the Parent Outreach time parents are able to meet with the ENL 
teacher before or after school to ensure their needs are being met. There is a sign in sheet and agenda during this time and all 
records are kept in the ENL's Data Binder.      

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

As new students enter the ELL program, our school will conduct additional new parent workshops, as well as other 
informational workshops.  Orientation sessions to parents of ELLs and parents of newly enrolled LEP/ ESL students will be held 
a few times a year as needed. There will be monthly Parent Workshops or conferences to motivate parents to understand and 
become more involved in their children’s education. These meetings for parents emphasize instructional issues, such as 
assessment, standards, school policies and strategies to help support student success and achievement. The ENL teacher, 
Parent Coordinator, and translators will participate in all workshops. Other presenters such as Administrators, Guidance 
Counselor, School Psychologist, Family Social Worker, Literacy Coach, Mathematic Coach, will be invited as needed. In 
addition, PS 40 will host workshops for parents of ENL students to strengthen parenting skills and minimize parental stress. 
Some of the workshops for parents meet on Saturdays. Parents are invited to come and meet the teacher on Open School 
Night.  Parents are invited to come into the classrom to do a read aloud with the class. Parents are also invited to come and 
learn along with their child once a month.  Also, in the beginning of the year the PS 40 hosts a Back to School BBQ . The BBQ 
provides an opportunity for parent and teachers to come together to get to know each other and the school by be involved in

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Alison Branker, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

PS 40 has several methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community. A needs 
assessment was conducted, which included the Principal, Assistant principal, Pupil Accounting Secretary and ENL 
teacher, regarding the written translation needs of the students enrolled in PS 40. Each students’ Home Language 
Identification Survey was assessed. All students whose home language was listed as non English on the survey was 
reviewed and discussed. Parents/Guardians and child(ren) are interviewed to assess the languages used at home 
with friends and family. Those parents receive a Home Language Survey in their home language. Parents also have 
the opportunity to write on the Emergency cards what language they prefer in written or spoken communication. 
Emergency cards can/are also printed in the parents home language. In ATS, under the biographical section, it 
states the child's home language. In addition the Adult Preferred Language Report is used to determine the 
preferred language of communication for parents. The findings of the (RAPL) are used to determine the necessary 
languages for oral and written communication to parents. 
The Language Translation and Interpretation Unit is used throughout the year to translate a variety of letters to 
parents. PS 40 also has staff members who speak Spanish, French, and Haitian Creole if parents need a translator. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

In addition letters that the ENL teacher sends out from the Department of Education are already translated into 
the different languages. Forms from the Department of Education and school calendars are also translated. 

Part III of the Home Language Identification survey allows for parents/guardians the option of a request for 
transfer to a bilingual program in a different school based on availability. Also, parents/guardians may request a 
bilingual class be opened and will be informed when enough students have requested a bilingual class in one 
language. Parents/guardians are informed of this right upon meeting with the ENL teacher during the interview 
process. Parents/guardians are given time to ask questions and voice their concerns. Parents/guardians are 
always given the opportunity to have an interpreter through the use of the Language and Translation Unit. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

parents/guardians. 

Teachers use in-house staff members 
for translation if available. The Language 
and Translation Unit number is called 
for parents with Limited English 
Proficiency. 

In-house staff members are used for 
translation purposes. The Language and 
Translation Unit or the use of 
translators will be provided for 
translations for Limited English 
Proficient parents. 

Translators will be brought in when 
requested for translations for Limited 
English Proficient parents/guardians. 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

PS 40’s plan of action to reach limited English proficient families in the event of a school emergency is to create a 
letter and have in-house translations, Translation and Interpretation Unit, or the Big Word translate documents to be 
used that will be submitted in case of emergency. Oral interpretations through the Translation and Interpretation 
Unit, Translators, or in-house translators will be used to communicate with families in case of emergency. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

The ENL teacher emails the contact information and an example of the services provided by the Translation and 
Interpretation Unit (with the Translation and Interpretation phone number) to the teachers, such as, translating 
letters or flyers for parents. This is also on the agenda at monthly ENL snack and learns and monthly Professional 
Learning Cycles. The Parent Coordinator uses this service to communicate with parents that speak other languages. 
The Language ID Guide Poster is posted prominently in the main lobby of the school for all to see when they enter. 
Teachers are also shown this poster to help instruct parents language needs. The Language ID Guide is also posted in 
the main office. The ENL teacher has the T & I brochure in her classroom.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

PS 40 will provide each parent whose primary language is not English and who requires language assistance services 
with written notification of their rights regarding translation and interpretation services in the appropriate covered 
languages, and instruction on how to obtain such services. This will be posted near the primary entrance in each of 
the covered languages that a copy of the Important Notice for Parents Regarding Language Assistance Services is in 
the main office. 

At the beginning of the year each teacher is provided with a Language ID card for parents/guardians to use if they 
need the use of a language interpreter. Parents point/touch the language requested and the Translation and 
Interpretation or in-house staff is used to accommodate language requests. The Language ID card is also present and 
visible in the Main Office. 

Our school’s safety plan will contain procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language assistance services are 
not prevented from reaching the school’s administrative offices solely due to language barriers. If our school would 
have the parents of more than 10% of the children speak a primary language that is neither English nor a covered 
language we will obtain from the Translation and Interpretation Unit a translation into such language of the signage 
and forms required. 
For limited-English Proficient parents, brochures, flyers, and letters that are shared with parents will be translated to 
meet their language needs through in-house staff or the Language and Translation Unit. 

 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Every year all parents are encouraged to complete the Learning Environment Survey at our spring Parent Teacher 
Conference. The survey is provided in the students' home language.  
Parents will be given a survey in their preferred language about their experiences with the language service provided 
(The Big Word, Language and Interpretation Unit, in-house staff member). This will be translated by in-house staff 
members (oral or written) or through the Language and Interpretation Unit.  
Surveys will then be read and interpreted to gather data and feedback on how limited-English-proficient parents 
prefer feel language services are meeting their needs or ways to better improve the language services provided. 

Also, a survey will be sent home to parents whose preferred oral and written language is not English in their Home 
Language to indicate when would be the best time to hold meetings and/or workshops. This is also another way to 
keep a record of the language these parents prefer oral and written communication be received. Surveys will then be 
read and interpreted to gather data and feedback on when limited-English Proficient parents prefer to hold meetings 
and/or workshops.
