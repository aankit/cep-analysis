Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

Esperanza Preparatory Academy aims to develop scholars who respect themselves, their community, and their 
cultural richness. Our scholars master the academic, social, and communication skills necessary to succeed in college 
and become agents of social change in our evolving society. We believe that it is our responsibility as educators to 
prepare Esperanza scholars for the global world they live in. This entails being able to succeed in academically 
rigorous systems, communicating and interacting in multicultural settings, and contributing as active citizens of 
society. Our goal is to foster and develop life-long learners, who embrace their bilingualism and are capable of 
successfully transforming the world.  

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Esperanza Preparatory Academy is a 6th-12th grade college preparation school, located at 240 East 109th Street in 
the Tito Puente Educational Complex, which is currently shared with two other schools (TAGS & a D75 M138 school). 

 

Our school's philosophy speak to the belief that all students have the potential to succeed and obtain college and 
career readiness. All teachers at the school hold high expectations for students regardless of their ability or disability 
with the belief that all students should have many educational options available to them. The school programs, 
philosophy and staff work collaboratively towards achieving these goals for all students alongside parents and the 
community. 

 

Professional learning opportunities in the school are closely aligned to the Chancellor’s mission and focus pillars. Our 
school’s instructional focus is supporting college and career readiness through evidence based learning, writing, 
communication and collaboration. Instructional coherence across the school and instructional alignment across the 
content areas forms the core work of the professional learning team, content and grade level teacher meetings. For 
example, based on our needs assessment, the school has implemented the school-wide use of Houghton Mifflin 
Harcout (HMH) Collections in the middle and high school ELA classrooms. Rigorous instruction in a supportive 
environment is the hallmark of classroom instruction at Esperanza Preparatory Academy and in this case, coherent 
ELA instruction will allow for the school to meet the needs of all students. After school activities further support the 
social, emotional, and academic development of all our students. 

 

Plan for Success: 

 

In order to achieve our mission at Esperanza, we will be working with several partnerships and implement initiatives 
to reach our prospective goals. These include, but are not limited to: 

  Quality Teaching for English Language Learners will provide professional development to the school staff with 
a focus on curriculum planning and scaffolding and rigor in all classrooms. Lead teachers will be coached ,who

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

As a Dual Language Program, we are able to create an environment where the language and culture of our students 
are celebrated, revered and used as a scaffold to ensure their academic success. Our program also supports families 
who would like to acquire a second language through immersing themselves in the culture, language and academic 
demands of the EPA. This provides a forum for all students to be celebrated as they learn from one another. 

 

As a diverse community of learners, our goal is to ensure all students have access to an engaging curricula that is 
aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. Currently, our school population consists of 32% of students 
identified as English Language Learners and 26% of students that have IEPs. Our charge has been to strengthen and 
deepen the content knowledge of our students and how they learn best, so we can provide the appropriate supports, 
strategies and scaffolds to ensure that they’re successful. Through the collaboration of language and content 
teachers, we are able to strengthen our practice and provide both our ELLs and Special Education students with an 
equal opportunity to succeed. Our students require differentiated presentation of content and assigned tasks, as well 
as extended timing and modified settings. 

 

The Esperanza Preparatory also provides a range or Enrichment and Arts opportunities for its students to address 
social-emotional needs through partnerships with Union Settlement, Young Men's Initiative, Young Women's 
Initiative, and various creative art partnerships. In addition, Esperanza Preparatory has been awarded the Immigration 
Grant aimed to support our ELL special population develop and enrich their academic English language through 
navigating real life situations. Students are encouraged to reinforce their English skills through experiential learning.

For the 2018-2019 academic school year, we will continue the literacy program, HMH Collections, engages EPA 
students with rigorous and relevant instructional materials that provide opportunities for them to become proficient 
and powerful readers. 

The comprehensive literacy program was developed to address the needs of the various student populations of EPA, 
such as the high percentage of English Language Learners and students with IEPs. This has been paired with scaffolded 
instruction and the development of units aligned to the Common Core. The inclusion of HMH Collections will 
accelerate and ensure that students are performing at their instructional level as well as working at and above grade 
level.  

 

The program has afforded steady gains, with an 8% increase in the 2016-2017 academic school year and a 17% 
increase in the 2016-2017 school year, in student achievements on New York State Regents Exams. To further support 
and meet the needs of our students at EPA, teachers will be using Achieve 3000 to assess student reading and lexile 
levels and be provided a number of relevant and lexile-appropriate texts for students. The data collected through 
Achieve 3000 will allow for a monitoring of our students' progress, as well as inform instruction. Teachers have 
become more proficient in using data from formative and summative assessments with students to enable targeted 
interventions with the English Language Learners and IEP students. Teachers are constantly supported in the 
development of this pedagogy in professional learning opportunities and collegial discussions around the work.

In the academic school year Esperanza performed proficiently in the following categories according to the 2017-2018 
Quality Review: 

 

- Establishing a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students, and families, and provides 
supports to achieve those expectations. 

- Align assessments to curricula, use on-going assessment and grading practices, and analyze information on student 
learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom levels. 

- Engage in structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared leadership 
and focuses on improving student learning. 

 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           16 

 

However, the results from the middle school New York State exam revealed that Esperanza's middle school is 
performing low on the ELA and Math portion of the exam. According to the results, in 2017-2018 students performed in 
ELA at a 18% proficiency level, In mathematics students performed 8% proficiency level in 2017-2018. 

 

Based on the academic performance, a priority for the 2017-2018 academic school year is to move the middle school 
out of focus area and improve the performance of students on the New York State ELA and Math middle school exams. 
The plan of action for this goal is to implement opportunities for teachers to engage in collaborative professional 
learning that will analyze, monitor, and refine best practices with a focus on curricula aligned assessment to support 
student growth as measured by the New York State 6 - 8th grade ELA and Math exams. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

By June 2019, there will be a 20% increase in student’s level 3 and 4 performance on the ELA and Math exam by having 
all teachers engaged in collaborative professional learning to analyze, monitor, and refine best practices with a focus on 
curricula aligned assessment to support the student growth as measured by the New York State exams.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-need 
student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE, 
STH). 

At EPA all classes use the Gradual Release of Responsibility (GRR), 
which is a structure for organizing classroom instruction and a 
vehicle which allows EPA scholars to become more engaged and 
invested in each lesson. This model provides more time for the 
scholars to read, write, talk and use effective learning strategies to 
explore and respond to the topics and ideas they are studying, as 
well as reflect on their own academic growth. The GRR model 
provides teachers with strategies for effective content delivery, and 
also provides consistency for our scholars across content areas. We 
have also identified teacher pacing, the scholars' need for structure 
and assumption of responsibility as key factors in school success. 
The GRR model provides support systems and planning tools that 
allow teachers to deliver more effective lessons and provide 
scholars with opportunities for self-management and practice of 
college and career skills. This model is a process that gradually 
releases responsibility for learning to students; struggling readers 
can improve comprehension, build vocabulary, and increase self-
efficacy. Finally, GRR will allow scholars to develop as life-long 
learners, build independence, and develop their ability to engage in 
dialogue with their peers and adults.  

 

We are also using teacher collaboration that focuses on student 
work and proficiency through grade data meetings, content area 
meetings and school-wide meetings. This is being used to plan and 
assess student performance, in order to meet their needs and help 
students meet their individual goals. Co-teaching is being used to 
decrease the student-to-teacher ratio and help improve student 
performance. 

-Engage NY an online program, is used by teachers to create lesson 
plans in Mathematics. Metamorphosis is a supportive platform, 
coaching, and professional development that will enhance teacher 
and student growth in their math skills.

Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH). Engage NY and Big Ideas Math (6-
12) is another Common Core aligned program that supports 
teachers in their instruction.  

-Achieve 3000 is an online program where students practice 
activities that focus on skills they need to improve in reading. 

-Students experience close readings of texts facilitated by ELA 
teachers. Student's are exposed to informational text and Common 
Core aligned units of study. 

-ELA and ENL teachers use the HMH Collections to provide students 
with opportunities to read Common Core aligned texts, engage in 
diverse genres of writing (persuasive, analytical, argumentative, 
narrative, expository), and learn close reading skills necessary to 
become analytical and critical learners through Close Reader 
consumables. HMH Collections is also interdisciplinary in that 
students tackle both literary and informational texts around a given 
topic.  

-Differentiated instruction, small group activities based on students’ 
needs and data-driven instruction will occur in all classrooms. 

To address the needs of students with disabilities, English language 
learners, and other high-need student subgroups, their basic English 
proficiency will be improved by identifying specific weaknesses from 
the data and implement programs to address them. Parents will be 
informed of areas of improvements for our English Language 
Learners and students with disabilities and how they can be 
supported at home through monthly school-wide workshops. 
Supplemental services will be provided for our English Language 
Learners population through a Title III grant which includes 
conducting workshop for our parents in areas of how to help the 
students with their homework and conduct ENL classes for parents. 
Parents are given information about State exams and Regents on 
how to support their child at home.

well as a baseline, midyear, end of year assessment and periodic 
assessments that inform and evaluate student learning. After 
measuring student learning, teachers will reflect, and design 
instruction that focuses on student needs and areas of growth. 
Parents will have access to students data on Skedula assessments 
and other information through the online grading system and parent 
outreach, so as to collaborate and support our scholars in their 
academic career at Esperanza.

In addition to regularly scheduled report cards, progress reports are 
mailed home every six weeks and teachers also make phone calls 
homes on a regular basis to keep parent/guardian updated with 
their child’s progress. 

In addition, Parent-Teacher conferences will be held following the 
citywide calendar of events. Scholars walk parents through samples 
of their work, outline SMART goals and explain learning strategies 
they will use to reach these goals. Similar to the school's Plan for 
Success, students and teachers work together to build SMART goals, 
which both parties are held accountable for meeting. Parents are 
aware of these goals and support the teachers and their students in 
achieving these goals.  

 

Workshops are developed for the parents of our scholars. During the 
workshops, parents are informed about the structure utilized at the 
school to teach a lesson such as the GRR model. Additionally, 
information about high school, college and careers are presented to 
the parents, as well as strategies that teachers use to prepare 
students in the classroom for their upcoming steps. 

 

We use Title III Immigrant funds supplemental program to assist our 
ELL student parent involvement. This program is geared towards 
increasing parent awareness of requirements and expectations of 
the New York City School System. The parents of all of our 
immigrant children will be eligible for this program. Our student 
population contains immigrant children from Latin America, the 
Middle East and Africa. We provide workshops for the parents in 
both Spanish and English. These workshops take place after school 
and are given by the school staff. 

Implement activities that address and build the element of trust 
between Teachers, Parents, and Students:

For the 2017-18, Esperanza decreased in Regents scores in most content areas. A large majority of the students who 
took the exam scored at a level 1 and/or 2. For students to be college and career ready, it is imperative that we move 
these students to Levels 3 and 4 and increase the passing rate of the exams. By implementing small group instruction, 
prep courses and enbedding intervention during school time will provide multiple learning opportunities, that will 
increase these numbers and bring about overall growth. Teachers will engage in professional development that supports 
and aligns with the needs of our students.

ELA Department 

A school comprehensive literacy program in ELA will be 
implemented to target students scoring below a 75% on the ELA 
Regents, ELLs, and students scoring at a level 1 and 2 on the ELA 
exam. ELA teachers will be following a continuous curriculum using 
the HMH Collections through grades 9-12. In connection to the HMH 
Collections, students have access to a myriad of literature circle 
books that teachers use to improve their analytical and critical 
approach. Teachers align their activities to the DOK levels (Depth of 
Knowledge) and will use differentiated paragraph frames and 
prompts to practice text analysis and argumentative writing, which 
sums to 55% of the ELA Common Core Regents. HMH Collections 
also offers differentiated instructional techniques that teachers can 
use when working with students who are ELLs and struggling. Other 
strategies and interdisciplinary activities will be used to increase 
student performance in state exam. Teachers will share best 
practices to build on and support cohesion within the department.  

 

Targeted professional development that will incorporate school 
wide implementation of defining intended outcomes, choosing 
teaching/learning activities likely to lead to attaining those 
objectives, assessing students' learning outcomes to see how well 
they match what was intended and finally reflect and revise to 
improve overall instructional pedagogy and student achievement for 
all student learners. 

 

ANET assessment and training will be provided to all ELA & Math 
teachers in 6-12th grade.

Esperanza Preparatory Academy Workshops will be offered specifically to the parents of the Title III scholars. All 
workshops will be given in both Spanish and English. 

Esperanza Preparatory Academy communicates with parents through several ways, which include but are not limited 
to the EPA online grading system, e-mail, Progress Reports, phone calls, letters, school website and the plan for 
success model. 

This year the teachers will use parent engagement time blocks to communicate with parents. The progress reports 
inform parents about their scholar’s progress in the program. Parents write feedback and comments on their 
children’s portfolio every week. Parents complete surveys as to the effectiveness of the program and areas that they 
like to see covered with their children. The cultivation of strong family-school partnerships is widely viewed as an 
essential component of strategies to improve students’ educational outcomes. Parent involvement plays an important 
role in improving students' success in school. All parents are informed on a regular basis of their child's progress 
through written progress reports during any given term and at the end of that term through report cards. The parents 
in our school have the opportunity to join the Parent - Teacher Association. This association is run by the parents with 
the assistance of our Parent Coordinator. Several workshops are offered during the year for our parents. During any 
meeting, translation services are offered to any parent.  

Also parents will be invited to special sessions of the program to see their child at work. 

Title III funds will be used to provide folders, notebooks, refreshments and MetroCards for the parents.

Although, the school has been working to align units of study and lesson plans to the Common Core Learning Standards 
through different resources such as, the Engage NY Modules, Collections, and Big Ideas, there are a number of teacher 
practices that need to be tailored to meet the goals and needs of our students and the overall requirement of the 
Danielson Framework regarding student engagement resulting in improved student performance. 

The results from the middle school New York State exam revealed that Esperanza's middle school is performing low on 
the ELA and Math portion of the exam. According to the results, students performed at a 18% proficiency level in 2016-
2017 academic school year. In addition, Esperanza also has a number of new 1st year teachers who need support in 
developing their practice. Therefore we will focus on improving teacher practice, as indicated by The Danielson 
Framework Rubric.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The principal is working to align EPA's mission and vision to all elements of the school community. School leaders are 
regular participants on all of these teams and work to foster teacher leadership on these teams. In the 2017-2018 school 
year, school leadership will work with greater focus on the development of teacher-leaders to engage in more 
leadership work within teacher-teams. Teacher voice is critical in informing decisions around instructional initiatives. 
The following is currently in place: 

1. Development of a grade level and department teams, in which all the work of the school lives; weekly meetings with 
clearly defined agendas and an emphasis on distributive leadership, with teachers and staff members taking on 
leadership roles. 

2. Teacher-leader training around facilitation skills and coaching skills.

aligned to the instructional focus of reading, writing and speaking. 

5. Active outreach by school leadership and organization of resources to allow additional student opportunities, such as 
after school programming and enrichment activities. 

6. Continued development of industry partnerships and other post-secondary partnerships to provide access to post-
secondary opportunities for all EPA students.  

7. Strategic hiring by the principal, based on a deep understanding of the needs of our students and rigorous hiring 
process to evaluate teachers’ capacity for meeting the needs of all EPA students.  

8. Provision of frequent opportunities for teacher and staff feedback, aligned to the Learning Environment Survey, with 
analysis of the data by PD Committee. 

With a large special education population that varies across different settings (ICT, Self-Contained, Alternate Assessed, 
Work-Based Study), we as a school need to improve our strategies to best address the needs of our special education 
students. Overall, most, classrooms lack differentiated instruction based on students' needs to help them access grade 
level content and appropriate co-teaching strategies.

Staff led special interest events and information sessions were provided such as Curriculum Night, Preparation for 
Senior Year, Meeting with the Principal Evening and High School Application Process. These engagements produced 
modest participation. The parents which participated provided verbal feedback of feeling welcomed into the building 
and receiving information with regards to their children’s education. Parents welcomed the opportunity and were 
pleased with being able to provide their own feedback and concerns which helps direct school leadership. 

Union Settlement Bridges Program (USBP) has received funding to concentrate their efforts with the middle school 
after-school expansion. The organization works with 30% of the middle school population. The organization offers an 
array of options for our scholars. Our scholars are engaging in more than one after-school activity: Book Club, Theme 
Teams, Spoken Word, Visual Arts, and Legacy Project. USBP is built on a foundation of academic development, 
social/emotional development, and the cultivation of informed, independent decision makers amongst youth.

important events. 

An increase in parent engagement will be developed through 
collaborative school-wide efforts. Parents will be notified through 
several outlets including letters/flyers sent home, and mass phone 
calls.Teachers can assist with reminders of event updates when they 
engage with parents. Advertisement of events will be announced via 
the school phone master and will posted on the entryway monitors. 

Teachers will engage parents through outreach, may it be by phone, 
in person, or by email. Parent outreach in regards to academics and 
behavior (both positive and negative) will be logged and reviewed 
by administration. Teachers, parents and students will have access 
to Skedula, the online grading system, where communication will be 
possible. Teachers, departments, grade-level groups will be 
encouraged to reach out to parents and collaborate in helping our

Section 6: Academic Intervention Services (AIS)  

(Required for All Schools) 

Directions: Schools need to maintain accurate records of students who are receiving Academic Intervention Services 
(AIS) to ensure that students who are not achieving proficiency receive effective and timely assistance. These records 
need to be made available upon request and indicate the total number of students receiving AIS in each subject area 
listed below and for each applicable grade in your school. 
 

 

Type of Academic 
Intervention Service 
(AIS) 

English Language 
Arts (ELA) 

Mathematics 

When the service is 
provided (e.g. during 
the school day, 
before or after 
school, etc.) 

These services are 
provided during the 
school day and after 
school programs. 

 

Accelerated Math 
program, push-in 
supports, house 
meetings, and clinics 
are conducted in the 
school day After 
School is for math 
intervention. 

 

Criteria for 
determining AIS 
services (For 
additional guidance, 
refer to NYSED’s 
memo.) 
These services are 
determined by the 
assessments for last 
year and this year 
summative 
assessments and 
baseline task. Also 
the teachers do 
formative 
assessment on a day 
to day basis to create 
the strategic reading 
groups and provide 
more support. 

 
These services are 
determined because 
many students have 
indicated that they 
have architects, 
doctors, and web 
developers as career 
goals. We want to 
accelerate this to 
ensure that every 
student who is 
capable of being 
committed and are 
motivated have the 
opportunity to 
pursue their goals. 
Also the teachers 
conduct formative 
assessment on a day 
to day basis to create 
the strategic groups 
for clinics and math 

Type of program or 
strategy (e.g. 
repeated readings, 
interactive writings, 
etc.) 

Strategies that are 
used in ELA are: A. 
Strategic Reading. 

B. Guided writing 

c. Independent

to cater for the ELL 
population at the 
school. 

 

 

These methods are 
delivered in small

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 
 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           49 

 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG or SIF funds: These funds

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Esperanza Preparatory Academy , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Esperanza Preparatory Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

● Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

● Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● Host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act .

or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● Conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness.

academic outcomes?  
The goal for Esperanza Preparatory Academy Community School is to align the school day academics into the after 
school curriculum. With a stronger partnership in Expanded Learning Time and Enrichment activities, Esperanza 
Preparatory Academy will be better able to correlate themes through the entire school day. Staff from the lead CBO 
will work along side Teachers during expanding learning time and build stronger relationships with students. After 
school staff will have a working knowledge of the topics examined during regular school and be able to merge it with 
their lesson for enrichment programming.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Rational: 
An analysis of the scores for our ELL population on the 2018  NYSESLAT, ELA and Math 
assessments suggests deficiencies in reading and writing. Through the Title III grant, our action 
plan for this group involves providing an after-school program that buildings the English 
Language skills necessary for success and Zooming in on weaknesses and strengths during 
academic instruction. 
This program targets current ELL's in grades 6 through 12 (Middle School students scoring a 
Level 1 and 2 in Math and ELA) and high school new comers students. Students will be 
identified. 
The Content Teachers are: 
1  ENL Certified – Teaching ENL 
1 ELA/ENL Certified - Teaching CC ELA for ELLs 
2-Licensed Math 7-12 Bilingual Extension – Teaching Math 
1 – Licensed – Science 7-12, Bilingual Extension –Teaching Science 
1 Licensed- Spanish LOTE -Teaching HLA  
The ENL teacher will be giving intensified instruction to all the Level 1 and Level 2 in ELA.   In 
addition, teachers will be focusing on understanding complex, readings, in order to develop 
thinking, reading, writing skills in English Academics. The Math teacher will be incorporating 
strategies on how to successfully apply their knowledge of math problem solving skills and 
content vocabulary.  The Science teacher will also be incorporating strategies and hands-on 
activities to help assimilate students focusing on Science vocabulary and linguistic.  The 
HLA teacher will be providing service to our SIFE in a push in model during our ENL 
classes.  She will be  incorporating strategies into the curriculum focusing on the four modules of 
listening, reading, writing and speaking.   To monitor our students we will utilize myOn, and 
Iready an online program that assists in assessing/monitoring student progress in reading and 
lexile levels. 
The schedule will be as follows: 
Program will begin November 1, 2018 - May 3, 2018: four days a week, one hour a day,  for a 
total of 18.00 weeks. 
Total of 6 Teachers: 
-Middle School:  2:50- 3:50 
Content Area: ENL (4 times a week), Math (4 times a week), and HLA (4 times a week) 
 
-High School: 2:50-3:50  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62 

 

 

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Content Area: ENL/ELA ( 4 times a week), Science (4 times a week) HLA teacher pushes into 
content to support and meet student needs. 
 
Our program will involve a certified Bilingual Math teacher for the middle school, who will 
focus on implementing QTEL strategies with a Math vocabulary focus and therefore improve 
linguistics. Progress will be monitored by administering ongoing assessments that can be used to 
inform instruction.  We believe that these additional classes will give the scholars the academic 
reinforcement that they need to build upon their mathematics abilities, as well as to improve their 
linguistic awareness/knowledge. Our math instruction will focus on collaborative work and build 
scholars problem solving skills.  Before the program is initiated scholars will receive a pre-
assessment, which will allow us to do skills analysis to inform instruction. Furthermore, to 
enhance the quality of instruction scholars will use math manipulative.  We will use myON to 
assess students reading level in the beginning of the program.  The languages of instruction will 
be in English and Spanish. There will be one certified ENL teacher and four content area 
teachers to provide instruction and guidance. The content areas that will be taught are ENL, 
English, Math, and Science.  
The middle school students will have ENL, Mathematics, and HLA twice a week one hour of 
instruction daily. The HLA teacher Co-teaches two times a week to provide writing support in 
the middle school and high school. In addition, to a stand alone HLA to provide intensive HLA 
writing. 
For the High Schools students, the students are broken up into two groups based on their 
NYSESLAT or NYSITEL score. The first group are students that scored Emergent level. The 
second group are students that scored in the Expanding level.   Students will have twice a week 
Living Enviroment and ENL. The groups divide their time between the living environment and 
ENL classes. The HLA teacher pushes in to each group providing writing support. 
Types of materials: 
The school has been afforded an online program called myON.The teachers will also use leveled 
readers for academic support. We will also use the RIGOR program which is a literacy 
intervention program through Science content. Both myON and the RIGOR program come at no 
cost to the Tilte III budget. Basic school supplies such as, notebooks, binders, paper and writing 
implements will be purchased for teacher and student use. I ready in common core I Ready in 
Mathematics and  ELA .

Begin description here:            
Esperanza Preparatory Academy Workshops will be offered specifically to the parents of the 
Title III scholars. All workshops will be given in both Spanish and English. 
Esperanza Preparatory Academy communicates with parents through several ways, which 
include but are not limited to the EPA online grading system, e-mail, Progress Reports, phone 
calls, letters, and the plan for success model. 
This year the teachers will use parent engagement time blocks to communicate with parents. The 
progress reports inform parents about their scholar’s progress in the program. Parents write 
feedback and comments on their children’s portfolio every week. Parents complete surveys as to 
the effectiveness of the program and areas that they like to see covered with their children.  The 
cultivation of strong family-school partnerships is widely viewed as an essential component of 
strategies to improve students’ educational outcomes. Parent involvement plays an important role 
in improving students' success in school. All parents are informed on a regular basis of their 
child's progress in the after-school program.  The parents in our school have the opportunity to

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At Esperanza Preparatory Academy, we have aligned our assessments for ELL's to the ELA Curriculum, thus preparing them to 
excel and make smooth transitions with the language acquisition process.  
Our English Language Learners are assessed via:

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68 

 

The EDAT and NYSESLAT information is utilized to accurately identify ELL levels and create instructional groupings.  
This information is vital to our school as we follow the GRR model of instruction and it serves the purpose of designing 
appropriate lessons that provide scaffolding and engage students in critical thinking discourse. 
 
  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
EPA utilizes the following assessments to identify instructional needs, monitor progress and address areas of language needs 
by modality: 
 
 
English Language 
Native Language 
Reading 
Writing 
Listening 
Speaking 
 
 
Programs in place monitor both native language as well as students' second language progress.  
   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Teachers meet twice a week during their common planning meetings to analyze student's data by grade/content and will 
utilize the ELL Data Analysis Tool Report to provide appropriate ELL modification, adjust lessons and update curriculum. 
 
Additionally, teachers meet once a week to discuss inquiry group students that encompass our most at-risk ELL special 
populations.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
At EPA strive for full engagement at the early intervention phase of RTI.  RTI is implemented by content and provides an 
instructional model that aims to develop specific student skills using a tiered system of instructional support.  Our specially 
designed student groupings provide instructional scaffold to the standard core curriculum delivered at our school, based on 
the changing needs of the ELL student learners. This includes levels of intervention and instruction that increase in duration 
and intensity over time; as students improve, measured by reliable and valid assessments, the extra supports are removed.  
 
Tier 1 is the instructional core that is intended to incorporate high quality evidence-based instruction for all students. This 
includes instruction that has been shown to be effective for ELLs, and differentiation to meet students’ diverse needs. 
Instruction for ELLs in English language development is provided at the Tier 1 instructional level. 
 
Students move into Tier 2 and Tier 3 if they demonstrate a need for more targeted and intensive academic support. This extra 
support can occur in the classroom, but also in separate pull-out settings with instruction focused on specific language learning 
targets. Tier 2 and Tier 3 instruction is also tailored to meet ELL language needs and is incorporated into research-based 
intervention strategies.  
 
In order to meet ELL needs in an RTI framework, it is important to understand their characteristics as children and learners, 
and to ensure that we view their status as language learners as an asset to draw upon as well as a dynamic developmental

process that is inextricably tied to learning opportunities. 
 
At EPA we strive to dismantle any misconceptions our teachers have about language and literacy development, and false 
notions can perpetuate a deficit view of ELLs’ ability to learn.  Through collaborative-team teaching and continuous teacher 
meetings, that it is a problem we aim to fix. 
 
See the Table at the end of this document for some of the common misconceptions about the language learning process for 
ELL students. In addition to having an understanding of these misconceptions, it is essential for practitioners to investigate 
their students’ educational and linguistic histories. Teachers need to build upon the linguistic capabilities students bring to the 
classroom and understand where challenges may lie. For example, a Spanish-speaking child struggling with the vocabulary of 
English school texts might have a well-developed Spanish vocabulary, at least conversationally. With an understanding of this 
child’s linguistic strengths, the teacher could guide the child to use cognates or familiar concepts in Spanish to support her 
English reading comprehension.  
 
There are many factors that influence the language learning process and corresponding academic development. These include, 
but are not limited to:  
Numerous components of our RTI implementation are specific to meeting ELLs’ needs, and show promise for supporting ELLs’ 
academic outcomes. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data patterns across proficiency levels on the NYSESLAT reveals that students made an improvement. 
In both the middle school and high school we increased the number Expanding and Commanding Students. 
 
Using the The EDAT filtering capabilities, our school can determine patterns across proficiency levels on the NYSESLAT.  Our 
ELL data reveals that in the Middle School we have a large population of Beginners and Intermediate, therefore instruction 
should be targeted to move these students in all modalities.  Additionally, we can devise groupings to create ELL groupings 
that target our students with the highest "At-Risk" factors.    
 
At the High school levels, we will ensure to target the Entering, Emerging and Transitioning students to also move them in all 
modalities.  In addition, to tracking ELL high school students and by monitoring their "At-Risk" factors, we can appropriately 
place them in targeted/instructional groupings to promote their language/academic success.  
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Common planning time has been embedded in teacher schedules where they will have an opportunity to conduct formative 
and summative assessments, as well as a baseline, midyear, end of year assessment and periodic assessments that inform and 
evaluate student learning. After measuring student learning, teachers will reflect, and design instruction that focuses on 
student needs and areas of growth.  In addition, in September administrators will share state level data to assist teacher in 
adjusting their curriculum and plans. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70 

 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

In our Stand-alone ENL program, a Certified ESOL teacher provides ENL instruction to our ELLs. Students are grouped 
based on their proficiency level and grade level. In addition, students received integrated ENL support in ELA and / or 
Social Studies. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

EPA has a total number of 568 scholars, and 179  (31.05% of the school population) is comprised of ELLs. 
EPA has a departmentalized program model in which teachers specialize in one content area. Consequently, some of 
our teachers are bilingual certified and content area certified. 
 
EPA’s Dual language program consists of one dual language class per grade. Scholars receive instruction in Spanish 
and English, following the 50/50 model. Classes are taught by unit and content. (For example: Literacy- Is taught and 
mirrored in English and Spanish.)  Social Studies and Electives are taught in English, while Science and Math are taught 
in Spanish.. 
 
The goal of EPA Dual language program is to develop student’s fluency and command of two languages with high 
quality, standards based instruction throughout schooling. EPA's (One-Way) Dual Language program is a bilingual 
program in which native Spanish-speaking students use their home language and English to learn content and 
language simultaneously.  Language and content teachers meet weekly to address areas of interdisciplinary 
connections that can be used to continually reinforce comprehension and learning.   
 
  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Based on Dual language model, scholars at EPA in the dual language classes receive the mandated or extra number of 
instructional minutes. The 50/50  instructional model allows for student to have the 360 minutes per week per subject area. 
Our ELL students in the ENL program who are at Transitional, and Expanding levels receive the mandated 360 of instructional 
minutes through a push in model by our certified ENL teacher. The ENL teacher works hand in hand with the ELA and Social 
Studies teacher to support ELLs in the classrooms. In our Dual language program, ELLs receive the mandated 360  instructional 
minutes in  5 periods of Native Language Arts, weekly and 5 periods of ELA.  In addition, EL scholars at the Entering and 
Emerging level receive stand alone ENL instruction multiple times a week. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The instructional approaches and methods used to make content comprehensible and meet the demands of the Common 
Core Learning Standards are as follows:  We have clearly define content and language objectives in teachers lesson 
plans.  We implemented school wide the Gradual Release Responsibility model of instruction.  This model provides students 
with an opportunity to interact, engage in discussions and ideas, practice and apply what they learned.  In addition, 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71 

 

teachers  were trained in QTELL (Quality Teaching for English Learners) to provide them with the tools to support students in 
acquiring a new language and the academic skills necessary to be successful in school. 
Within content instruction, ENL teachers promote ELL understanding by providing simultaneous vocabulary instruction, 
connect understandings with visuals, creating heterogeneous and homogeneous groupings, while also ensuring practice of 
language through all modalities (S,W,L,R).  In stand alone ENL, the teacher mirrors instruction of ELA content at a level that is 
accessible and comprehensive to the scholars.   
   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

ELLs are appropriated evaluated in their home language throughout the year, through Achieve 3000 to determine their Lexile 
Level in their home language.  In addition, teachers administer a BOY, Midyear assessment and End of year in students home 
language.   Spanish department meets regularly with the ELA department to discuss trends and progress in student learning.
  In addition, scholars have multiple opportunities to access information and practice their home language through bilingual 
libraries, home language Internet resources, and interaction with peers and teachers speaking their home language in school.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

          At EPA we differentiate instruction for ELL groups by the following methods: 
a) The child that has been identified as a SIFE student is provided a home Language proficiency examination in which a student 
is asked to read, write, speak and listen.  This informal assessment is used as a base of data to help us transfer ELL’s language 
knowledge into English.  This informal assessment takes into account multiple situations and contexts making sure the 
students are able to apply to language skills at the same level in all situations. At EPA, we evaluate a child in their native 
language by using Achieve 3000 in Spanish. That formal assessment will give us an idea of the student's reading  level.   In 
addition, the data from the ELE exam is used to comparatively measure growth and progress of ELLS in their home language. 
Trends and patterns are discussed in our study group meetings and then used to design cross-curricular units of study that 
help support learning and skills in all content areas of the Dual Language Program.   
   The scholar is placed in the Dual Language program to help him acquire the native language skills he or she is lacking while 
acquiring the skills to learn the second language.  SIFE students who have a low performance in their home language will also 
be pulled out to receive intervention in their home language in order to develop home language skills. Subject area teachers 
utilize a variety of activities to build on their home literacy. The use of visuals, story telling through pictures and illustrations, 
graphic organizers for students to jot down their ideas make learning more engaging and effective for the SIFE population. 
These students are also paired up with a more advanced student to support them with language and skills. 
          Subject area teachers also include a variety of practices to support these students. Some of these are the use of graphic 
organizers, brainstorming, literacy circles, interactive bulletin boards, vocabulary building, double entry journals, semantic 
maps, read and tell, think, pair and share, the writing process, quick writes, turn and talk strategy, and the Socratic seminar 
workshop.   
          For our 4-6 years regular ELLs, subject area teachers differentiate instruction by  providing students  strategies used to 
deliver ENL instruction through the content area. Students are given support on their understanding of new vocabulary 
through the use of visuals, maps, globes, and by connecting vocabulary terms to real-life situations or previous 
understandings. In addition, teachers promote 5 Habits of Mind with an emphasis on Evidence, Significance, and Point of View. 
ELLS  in all grade levels work on a number of projects throughout the year.  These projects give them the opportunity to 
express themselves in writing and practice using new vocabulary. 
         Based on the NYSESLAT data, the dual language/bilingual team has noticed that the writing and reading  modalities as the 
areas of focus for our long term ELLS. In order to support this population, EPA has come up with writing strategies  to build 
reading stamina and ensure scholars are regularly reading to acquire vocabulary and the use of comprehension strategies 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72 

 

needed to succeed.  EPA also acquired a ANET to access and monitor students writing. Achieve 3000 provides students the 
opportunity to practice their reading  of informational text at home.   
        EPA additionally addresses the needs of our  ELL with special disabilities. Our special education teachers are bilingual 
certified with bilingual paraprofessionals supporting and serving the ELLs with special needs. The school provides resources in 
Spanish and English to support and enhance instruction. Like bilingual Spanish libraries, books on tape, etc.  In addition, 
our  ELL-SWDs are integrated in all the school activities and academics. They take electives such as: technology, health, music 
and art while also participating in Town Hall, monthly assemblies, breakfast club, lunch and recess.  We strive to provide equal 
opportunities for education of students with severe disabilities with their non-disabled peers, mainstreaming students in 
content areas in which they excel, therefore increasing the possibility of admission into a high school diploma and later 
college.       
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
At EPA, teachers accomodate learning for ELL-SWD students by providing clear, step-by-step instruction that is easy and logical 
to follow.  Teachers explain and model content, practice skills with students, then monitor understanding through observation 
and rubrics.  Teachers often modify writing tasks by including organizers for ideas before writing, or recording ideas that can 
be played back to students.  Texts are often modified (chunked) to be more accessible to the individual levels of each 
student.  When extra support is needed, teachers ensure time for one on one or small group conferences to re-teach 
necessary content/skills and provide immediate feedback to struggling scholar. 
 
Grade-level materials that are used at EPA to accelerate English language development include curriculum materials such as 
INSIDE, an EL specialized curriculum that has specific instructions on how to differentiate content for language learners and 
those with specialized needs.  In addition, Achieve 3000 promotes practice of reading with content related to in class 
instruction.  The program allows scholars to work at a level specific to their own progress and tracks skills to provide quick, 
meaningful feedback to teachers about student progress.  Teachers use this regular, individualized feedback to support areas 
of need for these scholars. 
 
   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
EPA, is designed to meet the needs of all students, regardless of ELL or SWD classification.  Embedded in our curricula are pre-
assessments that identify target areas and skills for our ELL-SWD population to focus on.  We have programmed our teachers 
for push-in model, where students are receiving instruction at a lower teacher-to-student ratio for core subjects due to 
multiple professionals in the classrooms which addresses needs as per IEP goals for individual students while students are 
immersed in classroom material.  Additionally, students at the Entering and Emerging levels are provided with stand alone 
ENL that mirrors the instruction in their ELA class. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
At EPA, we implement various co-teaching models, there are 2 teachers in the room one ENL teacher and a content area 
teacher. After the focus-lesson is done, one teacher is working with a smaller group of students while the other teacher is 
working with the rest of the class assessing and monitoring student's progress and conferencing with our special 
population students (ELL and Special Education) to ensure progress for the struggling students and accelerate their learning, 
specifically targeting their diverse language needs.  Using ELL data, teacher observations/anecdotal notes, if a student is 
identified as requiring additional services, he/she will be placed in the appropriate pull-out student grouping.  
 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           73 

 

Our Dual Language model, continue the maintenance of the home language while at the same time strengthening the 
acquisition of English. We launched a reading program known as Achieve 3000 whose goal is to increase the reading levels of 
our ELLs scholars.  
 
At EPA our ELL scholars are immersed in a variety of supplemental program.  We recently launched Lunch and Learn a 
intervention program for struggling students to receive small group instruction during their lunch period for middle school and 
high school. Specifically in high school, the goal is to prepare student for their regents exams. 
 
Home Language Arts is taught in each Dual language class by grade (6th - 10th).  It will ultimately expand to 11th-12th grades 
in the 2018-19 school year. The instructional approach in Dual Language classes is centered on developing analytical and 
critical thinking skills based on Latin American literary text. There is also a focus on reading, writing and grammar skills in order 
to strengthen their home language.  Since the goal of the dual language program is to develop fully bilingual scholars, the 
instruction in NLA classes are aligned and mirror the instruction in ELA . We differentiate our instruction to cater to  those 
students with numerous "At-Risk" factors. Particularly in high school, the preparation of advanced placement material is 
required to get students ready to take Regents courses. 
 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

At this time we are considering an intense ENL Saturday Institute for new arrival students to this country.  Additionally, we will 
a comprehensive expand Dual Language program throughout high school.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

At EPA, we aim to enhance the exposure and time dedicated to the programs and services afforded to ELLs.  Therefore, the 
goal is to expand, enrich and cultivate the instruction of languages.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs. At EPA, we have bilingual staff members who coordinate after school 
activities, in both languages for academic and enrichment. 
 
The following programs are being offer to all EPA students:               
After-School program: ELA / Math intervention 
ENL Intervention during school schedule 
Saturday Academy: Entering and Emerging ENL which includes multi-cultural trips for students to practice their language 
acquisition. 
After-School Enrichment Program: Dance, Art, Music 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
At EPA, we offer Achieve 3000 in many other languages in addition to English, Running Records in all languages and a 
diverse library available in all languages and across contents. We have computers/iPads that offer programs that enhance the 
learning experience in the classroom, including Revolution K-12, and Duolingo classroom. We also have textbooks and 
independent readings available in English and in home languages.              
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In the dual language model, Native language support is delivered through books, articles, and teachers who conduct class in 
Spanish.  Scaffolding is provided in the native language through of use of vocabulary building, explicit instruction of home 
language cognates in ENL, graphic organizers, and implementation of reading strategies.  Instruction is meaningful and 
challenging to students and connected to real-life situations.  We incorporate all four language skills/modalities (listening, 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           74 

 

 

speaking, reading and writing).  We incorporate project based learning and extended projects, sometimes with a focus on 
aspects on students home culture/language. Students are encouraged to use their home language as a starting point in ENL 
courses.  When comprehension is demonstrated using their home language, they can then begin to construct writing/speaking 
responses and ideas in English.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

We have a leveled diverse library with books across all content areas. We also have programs like Achieve 3000 which level the 
materials according to the needs of the student. We also use the Common Core references and resources to guide instruction 
and scaffold learning to meet the needs of each individual student.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
At EPA, we offer Achieve 3000 is available in  Spanish and in English, Running Records in both languages and a diverse library 
available  in all languages and across contents. We have computers/iPads that offer programs that enhance the learning 
experience in the classroom, including Revolution K-12. We also have textbooks available in English and in native language.   All 
common space a shared through out the building and are scheduled prior to the beginning of the school year for equal access 
to all.          
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
At EPA, for new ELLS, who enroll throughout the school year, we offer a buddy ambassador to guide the student though their 
academic schedule. The grade buddy ambassador serves a mentor and resource for the new ELL and as a support through the 
routines and practices of the school.   In the beginning of the year we have a bilingual orientation for parents of Ell students co-
led by our parent coordinator who can be reached for questions at any time during the academic year.  Additionally, our 
Saturday academy provides ELLs and parents with necessary language to adjust to life/culture in their new country, as well as 
field trip opportunities that encourage language practice.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

  Spanish and Native Language Arts  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

 At EPA the instructional model is  50-50 where half of the content area subjects are instructed in Spanish 
and English. Literacy is taught in both languages. Math and Science is taught in Spanish.  Social Studies 
and Electives (Music, Art, Dance) are taught in English. Both languages are taught simultaneously. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs

Prior to the beginning of academic year 2017-2018, EPA Bilingual Team reviewed available data for our incoming 6th grade 
students.  We looked specifically at the elementary school testing history, including NYSESLAT data and ELA scores when 
applicable.  We also review cumulative records and IEPs when applicable.   
 
During the 2017/2018 year EPA will be conducting  full staff professional development sessions on ELLs.  The first session, 
focused on the identification of ELLs in all classes, using NYSESLAT data, and  strategies to use with ELLs such as the use 
of graphic organizers, brainstorming, literacy circles, interactive bulletin boards, vocabulary building, double entry journals, 
semantic maps, read and tell, think, pair and share, the writing process, quick writes, turn and talk strategy, and the Socratic 
seminar workshop. 
 
EPA teachers and non-pedagogic staff were provided with an all day QTELL training in November of 2017. We have scheduled 
two more professional development sessions to continue the training to support our ELLS with the New York learning 
standards.   
 
 
Professional development focused on the development of teacher expertise to engage English Language learners in deep, 
transferable learning.  
 
Increase understanding of and skills in using six types of scaffolding: modeling, bridging, schema building, contextualization, 
text representation and metacognitive development 
 
 
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 
 
To meet 154.2 requirement for ELL professional requirement  EPA teachers were provided with an all day  QTELL training in 
November of 2017. We have scheduled two more professional development sessions. 
Teachers received training on the following:

Task analysis  
  
 The bilingual team  will  train teachers  to focus  on strengthening ELL’s language acquisition in the classroom. Teachers will be 
given charts to highlight their ELLs’ Areas of Strength and Areas of Concern according to the 2017 NYSESLAT data. The 
team  will also share their expertise on the strategies for improving students’ vocabulary comprehension through the use of 
student glossaries.  In another professional development content area dual language teachers will discuss the 
identification  and tracking the language development needs of ELLs in monolingual classrooms. At EPA, we will also use 
literary circle in content area classrooms to deepen the ELLs understanding of non-fiction text.  Some bilingual teachers will

also shared her experience on the use of conferencing to inform, practice and assess ELLs’ listening skills. The bilingual 
coordinator will also facilitate a workshop on the use of the Listening centers for instruction of ELL.  Dual language, general, 
special education teachers, secretaries, guidance counselors, parent coordinator, assistant  principals, literacy and math 
coaches are provided with monthly professional development on how to support their ELLs Scholars. The dual language team 
will visit other bilingual sites to observe best practices.  The bilingual team with the the parent coordinator will visit other 
schools with bilingual or Dual language high schools to look at programs, best practices and share those practices at the school. 
Eight graders in the Dual Language and ENL program are also exposed to visit those high schools with the bilingual team. At 
EPA our bilingual team meets monthly with non dual language teachers, and lead coach for continual support and weekly with 
bilingual/dual language teachers to  mentor effective instructional approaches.   
Teachers will attend ongoing professional development at EPA and from outside independent providers during various 
workshops and turn key that information to our staff. Professional development activities have focused on best practices for 
instructing ELLs, understanding the social and emotional needs of ELLs, and how the counselor can support ELL students and 
their families, by linking them to additional academic and social service resources.  
 
   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
AT EPA the parent coordinator, Ms. Zoila Gomez, acts as a liaison between the parents and the school community.  She also 
meets on a regular basis with parents and maintains a very open communication with parents. The parent coordinator 
addresses their needs and provides them with guidance when guidance is needed. She is fluent in English and Spanish and 
maintains good rapport with parents.  She also helps by translating written and oral communication.  Parents feel welcomed 
and respected by the school population. During our annual individual meetings with parents we discuss students language 
proficiency results and the student academic and social progress.  In the event that the parent can't make the meeting, 
teachers have a phone conference with parents and a follow up email or text summarizing the meeting. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents are involved in many school activities throughout the year such as: 
 
Every trimester parents are invited to attend  an award ceremony to celebrate students achievement. 
There are monthly PTA meetings where all school information is shared. 
 School performance and assemblies 
The school also has Family Night in which we invite parents to come in one night and be part of a community celebration 
where guest speakers, community leaders come in and address the parents and students. 
The Bilingual coordinator organizes bilingual orientation and information session for ELL parents. 
Bilingual parent workshops are held three times a year    
The parents are informed through letters, website posting, school messenger  and school flyers.   
 
The school also provides parents with surveys and workshops to inform them about how they can help their children with 
organizational and study skills in preparation for High School and College.  
 
In addition, the parent coordinator maintains a contact log and bilingual binder with all bilingual documentation and parent 
outreach.  EPA provides parents with a survey to assess the type of workshop parents are requesting. Based on the survey we 
will develop a  series of workshops  throughout the course of the year held by our bilingual coordinator and ELL team.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Luisa Morales, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

EPA utilizes several methods to translate information for its parents. One of the most effective methods is 
through school 

messenger. This program allows the school to send e-mails and place phone calls to parents in multiple languages 
to insure that 

all the parents are maintained informed about all school events. Secondly, the program provides the school with 
data showing how 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           81 

 

many parents answered the call and how many messages were left. It also attempts multiple times until it 
receives an answer. 

Another method in which we maintain our parents informed and provide documents in multiple languages is 
through our website. 

Our school website has the ability to show information in multiple languages so that parents continuously 
maintain themselves 

aware of what is going on in the school. Furthermore, all letters, flyers, and documents are sent home in multiple 
languages to 

maintain all our parents abreast of what is happening within the school community. Finally, almost all the 
teachers and office staff 

in the building are bilingual; therefore, any parent that needs interpretation can easily obtain it from multiple 
members within the 

school staff. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 
 

Written

Language  

Based on the home language survey, 
ATS information, and information 
obtained during orientation the school 
determined that the 

two languages parents need 
information sent home in were Spanish 
and English. The school community was 
informed during 

orientation that all of the school’s 
information would be available in both 
Spanish and English. As mentioned 
before, most of our 

staff is fluent in both Spanish and 
English; therefore, translation is easily 
available throughout the school.

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.

engagement time.  

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The school will follow all mandated guidelines as prescribed in Chancellor’s Regulation A-663. Specifically, the school 
will provide immediate services or within (30 days) of a new student enrolling into the school, specifically, the 
Parent/Guardian Home Language Identification survey and video. In addition, during school meetings or conferences, 
all bilingual families receive translated materials such as the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities brochures and 
school articulation materials. In addition, the main office has a poster with information stating translation and 
interpretation services available to them. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We will gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services by the completion of a parent survey 
at Scholar Led Conference (SLC) or Parent-Teacher Conference and through our school website. Parents have access 
to communicate to all EPA staff via email
