Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION  

P.S. 91 is an elementary school in the University Heights section of the Bronx serving 658 students in grades K-5. It is 
presently a school in good standing in terms of NYSED accountability. We have General Education, Special Education 
(ICT and Self-Contained), ENL, and Bilingual classroom settings. We also offer support services that include ENL 
support, counseling, SETSS, occupational therapy, physical therapy, as well as mono- and bilingual speech therapy. 
Student attendance is 92%. Meridith Nasjletti has been principal at this school for 8 years.  

SPECIAL INITIATIVES  

Arts: We are very proud of our ever growing Arts program. We now have one dance teacher, two certified music 
teachers, one certified art teacher and most recently, a certified theater teacher. The music teachers organize 
concerts in the Winter and Spring that are enjoyed by the entire school community, including parents and elected 
officials. One of our music teachers runs a Select Choir and the other a String Orchestra program for our 4th and 5th 
grade students. We are also proud of our growing dance program and our new theater enrichment program. Our Arts 
program is also supported by outside partnerships from Bronx Opera to Jazz at Lincoln Center to Material for the Arts. 
These art programs have had a positive impact on parental involvement and increased the opportunities to invite 
parents into school. Rosie's Theater Kids is our most recent grant addition.  

PBIS: We are excited to be entering our fifth year of our school wide Positive Behavior Interventions and Support 
(PBIS) program. We have created a Social Emotional Learning Center to support a shift to a more positive discipline 
structure. District ten School Mental Health Consultant will be on site to support this initiative. We will be launching 
professional development in Social Emotional Learning (RULER), Crisis De-escalation, Culturally Responsive teaching 
and stress reduction techniques with the addition of a Health and Wellness teacher. Students are expected to meet 
school wide behavioral expectations of "Bee Safe, Bee Respectful and Bee Responsible" at all times. We used to 
reward students with “bee bucks” but as a result of our Responsive Classroom training, we have decided to forgo this 
reward system in an effort to teach our students to do the right thing because it is the right thing to do. This program 
is evident throughout the school building in classrooms, in hallways and in the cafeteria/auditorium and outside 
recess area. Each class's schedule also integrates the Responsive Classroom practices of Morning Meeting, Quiet 
Time, and Closing Circle. During the 2015-16 school year we expanded our PBIS program to include Character 
Education. The first of every month, each class engages in a grade-specific read aloud centered around a common 
theme (responsibility, honesty, cooperation, etc.). At the end of each month, each teacher selects a students of the 
month that exemplified the month's theme and two honorable mentions. In the 2018-19 school year we are 
expanding our PBIS program by introducing the RULER program, an evidence-based approach for integrating social 
and emotional learning into schools, developed at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence.  

Professional Learning: This is the second year that we have organized our Monday PD sessions around Professional 
Learning Cycles (PLCs). This structure allows us to differentiate professional development according to the needs of 
our teachers and students. It also provides opportunities for teacher choice and vertical alignment. Staff members 
also participate in professional learning opportunities with the Bronx Field Support Center. All staff members who 
attend professional development outside of the building are required to turn-key their learning to staff. This past 
school year we have added intervisitations to our professional learning program. 100% of our teachers participated in 
at least one intervisitation to share best practices and develop coherent instruction. In the 2018-19 school year, our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

intervisitations will focus on small group reading instructional strategies. We have developed a digital platform for 
teachers to share resources they find and develop through their professional learning. The digital platform also helps 
us keep track of the intervisitations and PDs attended by teachers.  

Athletics: We are very proud to say that the PS 91 Tigers are two-time After School Athletic Program (ASAP) District 10 
Champions! The basketball games have helped to improve our school’s culture, helped support the personal 
behaviors that will help our students be college and career ready, as well as provide additional opportunities for 
parent engagement. This year we achieved All-Star status through the Move-to-Improve program, a free classroom-
based physical activity program that helps elementary school teachers enhance their lessons with activities that get 
students moving. We have two physical education teachers. One is a certified PE teacher and the other was selected 
by the DOE to facilitate a multi-session citywide Phys Ed PLC.  

STRATEGIC COLLABORATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS  

We have many partnerships to enhance our school program. Through our collaboration with Education Through 
Music (ETM), we hired two certified music teachers and who ensure that students receive quality music instruction. 
ETM follows a skills-based, comprehensive, and sequential curriculum that is aligned with the State and National Arts 
Learning Standards and the Common Core Learning Standards. Additionally, our partnership with ETM provides 
afterschool programs including a chorus and an orchestra for grade 4 and 5. This initiative has been largely supported 
by our partnership with City Councilman Fernando Cabrera.  

The program Jazz for Young People on Tour: Let Freedom Swing: Conversations on Jazz and Democracy, in-school 
concert series. Jazz for Young People on Tour brings outstanding jazz artists and performances to NYC and 
metropolitan area schools.  

This year we will continue our partnership with Materials for the Arts. The residency program brings MFTA to our 
school to enhance curricula in social studies and language arts. Teaching artists lead workshops in reuse and project-
based learning that are aligned to the Common Core Standards and Core Knowledge Language Arts. MFTA works with 
grades 1-4 to integrate art into their culminating task.  

Our partnership with Monroe College have brought about a dozen college students enrolled in education programs 
into our classrooms to work directly with our teaching staff and to provide additional support to both teachers and 
students. This year we are expanding our student teacher partnerships to include Manhattan College.  

This year we are adding a new partnership with Early Reading Matters. Through the Early Reading Matters, teachers 
will learn how to implement research-based strategies, identify and use high quality texts, and align teaching to the 
Common Core standards, while being mindful of the needs of very young students. As an important element, they 
also build the capacity of early literacy teacher leaders to sustain this work. Early Reading Matters' literacy coaches 
will provide teachers with targeted support in effectively planning and executing the components of the reading 
block, frequently assessing students, and engaging in collaborative inquiry.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The student population is 75% Hispanic, 17% Black, 4% Asian, 2% White, and 1% American Indian. There are 548 
English Language Learners, 40% of our students. Students with special needs comprise 21% and 244 students (32%) 
live in temporary housing. Our NYC DOE “Poverty” count is 94% which is based on the number of students with 
families who have qualified for free or reduced price lunch, or are eligible for Human Resources Administration (HRA) 
benefits.

2016-17 Quality Review Celebration: School Culture  

During the 2016-17 school year, we had a very successful Quality Review. We were rated well developed in both 
indicators for School Culture, 1.4 and 3.4 (as well as 1.3). Our reviewer, Dr. Marian Wilson found that "The school’s 
approach to culture building, discipline, and social emotional support is derived from their belief in educating the 
whole child. Structures are in place so that each child is well known by at least one adult who checks in with students 
on a regular basis." The impact of this work is that "the clearly defined and implemented system for consequences 
and rewards has resulted in a safe and inclusive culture where student leaders are meaningfully involved in decision-
making efforts. Having students improve their ability to self-regulate, work with others, and persevere through 
difficult tasks has led to fewer disciplinary incidents."  

2016-17 Quality Review Area of Focus: 5.1 Monitoring and Revising Systems  

On our last Quality Review, we received a rating of "Developing" on indicator 5.1. Our quality reviewer found that 
"although instructional cabinet meetings are held regularly, evaluation of teacher practices across all grades and 
subjects is inconsistent. While school leaders review data from observations, adjustments are not routinely made and 
there is uneven monitoring of the effectiveness of professional development trainings." As a result, school leaders 
and staff developed a process to regularly monitor and adjust decisions affecting the instructional core. The school’s 
instructional cabinet created a documented system to review policies in relation to their use of resources, 
effectiveness of teacher feedback, and quality of teacher teamwork. We are using SharePoint as our digital platform 
to share resources, track data, record and publicize meeting notes, and update curricular materials.  

2017-18 PPO Areas of Celebration  

4.1 At our last PPO, the superintendent celebrated that “it is evident in the Advance reports and your scheduling of 
observations, that you are committed to delivering timely feedback to teachers, with next steps for growth. I 
appreciate that you call on our TDEC to facilitate PD for your teachers in understanding of the expectations of the 
Danielson Framework for Teaching. Additionally, I noticed that you are committed to developing teacher leaders and 
your commitment to distributed leadership lives in actions such as, empowering your teachers to lead instructional 
initiatives, participate in the district and the FSC professional learning communities. Furthermore, your invite to 
teachers requesting they be part of the decision-making is promoting change and collaboration.  

5.1 It is because of your reflective leadership that your school experience the success of increased student 
achievement and the revival of the community interest in PS 91. Programmatic changes, improvements in the 
rigorous assessments, and the wider recognition of the school in the district, speak to your leadership. Including 
evaluating existing practices, rigor of tasks, and, most of all, your intellectual and sensitive approach to facilitating 
change. I am confident that you will continue on this path throughout the year.”

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
strengths 

At the end of the 2017-18 school year, our overall reading proficiency according to Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark 
Assessments, 46 % of our students read at or above grade level. 87% of 5th graders made at least a year’s growth in 
reading. Our universal literacy coach has been working with the K team throughout the 2017-18 school year focusing 
on increasing the effectiveness of instruction. She facilitated their implementation of literacy-based centers to 
increase the time they have to provide small group instruction. 

Needs assessment 

At the end of the 2017-18 school year, 36% of students in kindergarten read at or above grade level. 14% of Kinder 
students (16 students) were still non readers at the end of the year. 52% (62 students) were performing at a level 1, 
far below grade level. This is the largest percentage of level 1 readers in our school. The proficiency of our 
kindergarten readers has been steadily decreasing since 2015-16. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, kindergarten teachers will engage in professional learning activities including viewing model lessons, 
foundational reading workshops, and looking at student work so that there will be a 5% increase in K reading proficiency 
according to the Fountas and Pinnell reading benchmark assessment. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 
Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Early Reading Matters will provide professional development and 
modeling around interactive read aloud, guided literacy, shared 
reading, and independent reading. They will also build teacher 
capacity and support teachers ability to use data to drive 
instruction. 

Professional Development: Universal Literacy coach will continue 
to support the K teachers by providing professional development 
including, co-planning, co-teaching, modeling, and data analysis. 
She will also facilitate team meetings and intervisitations to 
share best practices. 

Universal literacy coach will write and revise units of study to 
increase coherence across the grade and plan out the CCLS-
aligned objectives. She will also work with the K literacy 
committee members and meet with grade teams to ensure 
teacher input and ownership. 

Modify assessment cycle: Previously all incoming kindergarten 
students were assessed for F&P reading proficiency in 
September. Now in order to focus on phonological awareness 
and phonics (letter, sound, and sight word identification as well 
as concepts of print), we are not testing all K students on F&P in 
September. However, if a student scores a level 3 on all primary 
assessments, they will continue to be tested to find out their F&P 
level. 

By October 1st all students should participate in small group 
reading instruction (literacy centers or pre-A/emergent guided 
reading). 

Coaches and admin will periodically review assessment data and 
hold data talks with the teachers to support their data-driven 
instruction and ensure that students who are struggling to meet 
grade level expectations will receive the additional support 
needed. Coaches will also update admin on their ongoing 
support of teachers and their progress. 

ENL provider will support struggling ELLs in reading 5 periods a 
week focusing on reading, writing, listening and speaking 
strategies.

State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Parents are provided monthly opportunities to attend workshops, which will address and inform them of Common 
Core Reading and Writing Standards, homework help and reading at home. There are weekly parent engagement 
opportunities to discuss student progress. We will share progress with families through report cards, progress reports, 
and Monday Parent Engagement time. Kinder will also have a Parent-Child orientation. In addition, we will encourage 
parent volunteers to come in to read with the kindergarten students. Bravo Bulletin Board with school highlights will 
be in public view for parents to see as well.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Strengths:  

  The 2017-18 NYS Learning environment survey says that 96% of teachers say that "students are safe in the 

hallways , bathrooms, locker rooms, and cafeteria of their school. 98% of teachers say that "students are safe 
in their classes." 

  Our 2016-17 Quality Review we received a well-developed rating for 1.4 School Culture and 3.4 High 

Expectations. 

  Year Five of Three Bees PBIS Program: Be Responsible, Be Respectful, Be Safe. School-wide behavioral 
expectations outline how to be responsible, respectful, and safe in all areas of the school including the 
classroom, hallway, bathroom, cafeteria, and at recess.  

  Year Three of Character Education: The whole school engaged in a read aloud and discussion the first Friday 

of the month around a common theme (i.e. Honesty, Courage, etc.). Each teacher awards a student of the 
month who best demonstrated the monthly theme as well as  

  Year Two of Responsive Classroom Initiative: Responsive Classroom is an evidence-based approach to 

education that focuses on the strong relationship between academic success and social-emotional learning 
(SEL). The Responsive Classroom approach empowers educators to create safe, joyful, and engaging learning 
communities where all students have a sense of belonging and feel significance  

  Principal and School Culture/climate coach attended RULER training 

Needs:  

  The 2017-18 NYC Learning Environment Survey indicates that only 51% of teachers agreed with the statement 

that answered the question about students behaving"even when the teacher isn't watching." 
 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the PBIS team will create a Social-Emotional Learning Center with supports from the School Mental 
Health Consultant to provide students, parents, and staff, to create effective positive behavioral strategies and 
techniques so that there is a 10% increase on the Learning Environment Survey question about students 
behaving"even when the teacher isn't watching."

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths 

On the NYC Learning Environment Survey, 81% of teachers say that teacher "are actively trying to improve their 
teaching." 70% of teachers say that, "teachers take responsibility for improving the school". 79% of teachers say that 
"teachers feel responsible that all students learn." 

In the 2017-18 school year, every teacher completed at least one intervisitation and commented during EOY 
Summative Conferences that, "the intervisitations were very motivating and helped to improve their teaching 
practice." We also began to incorporate team-building activities into our professional learning plan. 

Specialized teachers work on vertical teams to build collaboration beyond just the grade team. 

Needs Assessment 

On the NYC Learning Environment Survey, 49% of teachers said that, " teachers are eager to try new ideas." 61% of 
teachers said," the principal, teachers, and staff collaborate to make the school run effectively." Teachers also 
commented that they would like to see instructional successes in other grades and have opportunities to choose 
specific teachers and instructional strategies they can view to develop their craft. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, all teachers will engage in at least one peer-facilitated intervisitation and reflect on best practices in order 
to support one another in developing their pedagogy so that there will be a 5% increase in overall F and P proficiency.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Supporting teachers with their professional growth is a priority at PS 91 in order to increase student achievement. As 
related to the Effective School Leadership element of the Framework for Great Schools, we feel that we are 
developing systems of accountability that set high expectations, create coherence across the school and help support 
professional growth. According to the 2017 Quality Review feedback, QR indicator 4.2 was identified as an area of 
celebration. The review report states “All teachers are engaged in professional collaborations and vested in increasing 
school-wide coherence and student achievement.” We have also established systems that increase shared decision-
making about student learning and support, therefore building teacher capacity. School leaders and various 
stakeholders (grade level teams, vertical grade leaders, SIT team, RTI team, PLC teams, PBIS team, consultants and 
coaches) meet regularly to look at student work, analyze data and make decisions on how to best support students. 
Through the action plan for this goal, we will analyze and improve the systems and structures we have in place to be 
able to improve school-wide practices, so that we may better support student learning and address any learning gaps. 
We will use multiple data sources to make programmatic decisions, areas of focus, and guide the way we support the 
faculty with their professional growth to improve teacher practice throughout the school. Based on the 2017-18 
MOTP ratings from the Advance teacher evaluation system, in Domain 1- Planning and Preparation, 16% of teachers 
were rated Highly Effective, 71% were rated Effective, 10% were rated Developing and 3% Ineffective. Our goal is now 
to support teachers in their continuum towards effective and highly effective teaching practices. 

According to the 2016-2017 NYC School Survey there were 78% positive responses in reference to Effective School 
Leadership, indicating the need to close the gap between the belief of the school community and the practices of the 
school leaders. We need to continue developing a climate of shared leadership that includes input from all members 
to support the school vision for student achievement. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, school leaders will norm feedback three times a year in addition to implementing a revised observation 
schedule, as well as bimonthly meetings, to share feedback, discuss trends, and teacher needs so that there will be a 5% 
increase in positive responses on NYC Learning Environment Survey question about the principal and assistant principals 
functioning as a cohesive unit.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths 

It is our overall goal to provide a welcoming environment for PS 91 families as we must foster a strong partnership so 
our students to succeed. As part of this goal we plan to provide families with the necessary support both with 
academic and social emotional developmental health so that they can support their children to succeed in school. To 
be able to accomplish this, we plan to provide targeted and specific workshops and school events to help parents 
understand the curriculum, assessments, and different strategies that will help support students in and outside of 
school. 

One of the school’s strengths connected to the Strong Family-Community Ties element is setting and communicating 
high expectations. According to the 2017 Quality Review, PS 91 was rated proficient for indicator 3.4. The reviewer 
stated, “school leaders and faculty have high expectations for students and communicate effectively with parents so 
that there are multiple opportunities for families to be active partners toward improving student outcomes.” 
Additionally, the 2017-2018 NYC School Survey indicates 91% of parents/guardians feel teachers communicate 
regularly with them, and 91% have seen their child's projects, homework, tests, or quizzes. We need to continue 
building upon this strength to increase family involvement in our school community. 95% of families say that the 
principal at their school works hard to build trusting relationships with families like them. 93% of families say that 
teachers work closely with them to meet their child's needs. 

Our Parent Survey response rate increased from 50% to 83%. 

Needs Assessment 

As related to the Strong Family-Community Ties element of the Framework for Great Schools, the 2017-2018 NYC 
School Survey indicates only 88% of families say they get opportunities to visit their child's classroom, such as 
observing instruction or participating in an activity with their child. Furthermore, only 59% of the parents responded 
said they have volunteered time to support the school. We will continue to work on strengthening outreach efforts 
and trying to engage families so they can become more active participants in the school community and support 
student learning and performance. It is our goal to provide families with specific data on student performance of 
grade-level standards, and what students need to do in order to improve and increase achievement. We also need to 
support families with understanding how to use the data to help students achieve and make progress. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the

By June 2019, all PS 91 staff members will provide organized monthly opportunities for parents to attend school-wide 
events and participate in educational activities so that there will be a 5% increase in parent responses on the Learning 
Environment Survey.

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Parent Engagement Time: We have set aside every Monday from 
2:20 to 3:00 pm so that teachers have weekly opportunities to 
contact parents by phone or set up individual parent meetings. 
This year we will be working on student-led conferences. By 
welcoming and valuing families and by including them in the 
school community, the school builds a strong partnership that 
leads to student success. Moreover, our parents are invited to 
join our staff and parent chorus.  

Parent Workshops: A survey was sent home to gauge parent 
interest and preferences. Workshops are provided at least once a 
month for parents. They range from topics like: Understanding 
Your Child’s Reading Level, Homework Help, Preparing for the 
State Tests, and Gearing up for the Next Grade. There are Arts 
and Crafts workshops for all holidays. ELL parent meetings to 
address NYSESLAT results will be held in October 2018 and 
November 2018. Our ELL Parent Orientation meeting takes place 
every year in September. 

Strategies to address students in subgroups: In order to address 
the needs of English Language Learners, we are providing ENL 
Parent classes in order to support our parents who speak a 
language other than English. NYSESLAT test meetings. Translators 
are available for all meetings and all letters/flyers are translated

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
The hiring committee reviews resumes submitted on Open Market, attend hiring fairs, and review list of highly 
qualified candidates provided by the DOE. New staff completes a rigorous interview process by a hiring committee 
and administration. They are required to do a demo lesson, submit a resume, writing sample, and provide letters of 
reference. Candidates are interviews by the team to ensure that teachers, coaches and administration all feel the 
candidate is highly qualified. They perform their demo lessons in grades/settings that they are interviewing for so the 
team can gauge their effectiveness in that setting. 

New staff is provided with in-house and outside professional development. Intervisitations are provided as well as a 
mentor to support professional growth. Professional development is provided every Monday. The PD committee that 
includes teachers, coaches, administrations, UFT rep, and other support staff plans in-house PD. The PD committee 
also consults the grade leaders, literacy committee, math committee, SIIT, and others to ensure that the PD offered 
meets the needs of the teachers, students, and school. This year we have begun organizing our PD into Professional 
Learning Cycles where teams of teachers choose an area in need of improvement to study and practice in their 
classrooms for a series of 5 sessions. The final session includes an evaluation as well as a whole school share out. 

Constant feedback from supervisors after informal and formal observations also helps to support best practices. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Professional development is offered in house as well as through the Borough Field Support Center liaisons. All staff 
who attend PD outside of the building is required to “turn-key” information. Teachers submit evidence of attendance. 
Highly effective teachers/ coaches provide ongoing professional development in house. Teachers plan weekly during 
teacher team meetings to ensure CCLS are being addressed during planning and instruction. All staff has many 
opportunities to attend professional development. This includes assistant principals, teachers, paraprofessionals and 
service providers. All professional development centers around Rigor and the Common Core Standards as well as the 
Chancellor’s initiatives and expectations described in the Framework for Great Schools: rigorous instruction, 
supportive environment, collaborative teachers, effective school leadership, strong family-community ties, and trust. 
We have also incorporated Professional Learning Cycles to foster a culture of learning and mutual accountability.

intervention services, etc.). 
After turning five process, guidance counselor will reach out to turning five parents to schedule a meeting to tour the 
building and review curriculum and elementary school expectations at P.S.91. During the school year the kindergarten 
team will continue to work with parents to support their children’s transitions from early childhood programs to 
elementary school.  

 

In addition this year our entire staff will be trained in the Responsive Classroom approach which is research based and 
emphasis the social and emotional well being of all students. We will also provide parents with workshop and 
instructional materials. 

 

Our guidance counselors will provide parent outreach so that families can tour the building, meet kindergarten 
teachers and staff and review the kindergarten curriculum. 

 

This year we will be adding a Parent/Child orientation to help transition our kinder students, A flyer was sent home 
over the summer 2018.

All formative and summative assessments are reviewed and discussed with literacy and math committee members, 
grade leader teachers, coaches, and administration in order to select a combination of the most efficient and 
appropriate programs based on standardized assessments. Professional development is provided for all teachers to 
be trained in administering all assessments and scoring is normed. After each assessment is completed, results are 
obtained and data is reviewed in order to target specific student strengths and areas of need. Instruction is then 
targeted for differentiated groups of learners. In addition, teachers’ conference logs provide other relevant 
information regarding student needs. We use the Fountas and Pinnell reading assessment, Writing Pathways rubrics 
for writing assessment, Go Math! Assessments for math. We have simulations that mimic the NYS tests, content and 
comprehensions quizzes from the Core Knowledge Language Arts curriculum and the math Performance series.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 91, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

P.S. 91 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

· providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

· providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

· fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

· providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

· actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

· engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly 
to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

· ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

· support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; 

· maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

· conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home; 

· provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

· host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

sections under the the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

· schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

· translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; 

· conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement

o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.

For the 2017-2018 school year, 294 ENL students took the NYSESLAT in the spring of 
2018.  As of yet, we do not the results.  However, through in-school scoring, we have determined 
that 48 students across our school, grades K-5 scored a level 4 in Writing using the NYSESLAT 
scoring rubric.  The results (according to our in-school scoring) are as follows: 7 students in 
Kindergarten, 4 students in 1st grade, 17 students in 2nd grade, 5 students in 3rd grade, 10 
students in 4th grade and 5 students in 5th grade.  In addition, according to our in-school scoring, 
we had 70 students across the grades score a level 4 in the Speaking portion of the NYSESLAT; 
the results are as follows: 4 students in Kindergarten, 8 students in 1st grade, 13 students in 2nd 
grade, 11 students in 3rd grade, 20 students in 4th grade and 13 students in 5th grade.  Once the 
NYSESLAT results are provided in the fall of 2018, we will use the data in order to support our 
ENL population.  At that time, we will provide instructional support in all four modalities: 
reading, writing, listening and speaking, and in Math with a focus on improving reading and 
writing in all content areas and across grades 1-5.  Our program will be scheduled for two days a 
week on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons from 2:30 to 4:30.  Our program will use English 
as the language of instruction.  Our Title III after-school program will consist ENL students for 
whom we will provide direct, explicit instruction.  
According to our 2017 ELL Data, 5 students scored at Level 1 or 2 on the ELA (1.7%); 4 
students scored Level 1 or 2 on Math (1.4%); 50 ELLs have been held over in the past 3 years 
(17.2%); there are 52 ELL students at-risk level 3 or greater (17.9%); we have 25 ELL students 
at-risk level 5 or greater (8.5%) and we have 24 ELL students in years of service 5 or 6 
(8.2%).  In comparison with non-ELL students, 7 or 1.6% scored Level 1 or 2 on the ELA; 7 or 
1.6% scored at Level 1 or 2 on the Math; we have 46 or 10.3% of non-ELLs held over in the past 
3 years and 58 or 13.0% of non-ELLs with at-risk level of 3 or greater and 14 or 3.1% on non-
ELLs at-risk level 5 or greater.  We also have 2 NYSESLAT test takers who scored Expanding 
and a level 3 on the ELA.  66 of the NYSESLAT test takers advanced 1 proficiency level; 17 test 
takers advanced 2 proficiency levels; 5 test takers advanced 3 proficiency levels and 78 test 
takers remained at the same proficiency level; in addition, 11 ELL students regressed 1 
proficiency level.   When we receive our ELA and Math test results, we will determine how we 
will move forward and the kind of support we will provide for our students.   In the 2017-2018 
school year, we used two research-based books from Continental Press to support our ENL 
students; they are Finish Line for ELLS 2.0/English Proficiency Practice for all grades and 
TEAM (Teaching ELLs for Academic Language Mastery) in grades 3-5.  We offered one class 
of 18 students per grade in grades 1 and 2 and 19 students in grade 3, 20 students in grade 4 and 
16 students in grade 5.  Small class size allowed us to provide small group differentiated 
instruction and to focus on the needs of our Expanding and Transitioning students.  The books 
that we have chosen allowed students to improve their performance across the language domains 
and become familiar with tested item types.  The lessons addressed the five content areas across 
four language domains and included multiple choice, short and extended-writing tasks and oral

speaking.  TEAM helped ELL students develop grade-level academic language needed for 
classroom success; the academic terms addressed the 4 modalities and they reinforced the 
content areas in science and social studies as well as language arts and math.  It provided 
differentiated instruction by choosing alpha-leveled books.  
In addition to direct, explicit instruction in the four domains for 50 minutes, students are also 
received direct, explicit instruction for 50 minutes in Math using the program Focused 
Mathematics Intervention Kit, which supported the goals of the Common Core State Standards, 
is a research-based program and focused on learning, classroom discussion and practice; it 
balanced conceptual understanding, visual learning and problem solving.  It also provided digital 
learning tools and apps as part of the program.  
This year our Title III Supplemental program began on October 18, 2017, and ended on April 26, 
2018, which was approximately 44 days; therefore, equivalent to 88 hours of instruction.  The 
instructional language was English and there were five instructors who are either TESL certified 
or who have bilingual extensions.  The dates for the program was as follows:  October 18, 19, 25, 
26; November 1, 8, 9, 15, 16, 29, 30; December 6, 7, 13, 14, 20, 21; January 3, 4, 10, 11, 17, 18,

Part C: Professional Development: 
In order to address the needs of our LEP students based on the 2017 NYSESLAT results, our 
teachers received professional development on the following dates at no cost to Title III: 
10/16/17, 10/18/17, 1/29/18, 2/5/18, 2/26/18, 3/5/18 and 4/30/18.  We addressed the following 
topics: the 2017 NYSESLAT results: How to Interpret the Scores and What are the Implications 
for Instruction; NYSESLAT test prep: Writing Rubrics and Checklists, NYSESLAT Testing 
Procedures and Protocols, Academic Language for ELLs, Guided Reading for ELLs and 
TOMS.  In addition, the five teachers who taught in the Title III Supplement Program also 
participated in professional development addressing implementation of both programs in ELA 
and Math; the programs selected for the after-school program.  The teachers who were teaching 
in the after-school program familiarized themselves with the materials for both programs and 
added supplemental materials when needed.  Moreover, they formed a study group, Looking at 
ELL Student Work, and approximately every six weeks, they met to evaluate student work, 
determine student progress, make adjustments where necessary and conduct pre- and post-

assessments at the beginning and end of the after-school session. The ELL After-school Teacher 
Study Group dates are as follows: 11/29/17, 2/1/18, 3/22/18, and 5/10/18.  The information 
gathered was documented during each study group meeting and the results from this work 
was  presented on 5/10/18.  At that time, the study group assessed student progress and compiled 
their findings; this information also informed them of how to proceed in order to address the 
needs of the students effectively and efficiently in the after-school program for the following 
school year.  At the final meeting, teachers made recommendations in the following areas: 
address student absences to provide consistency, order picture dictionaries and/or picture cards, 
target specific skills weekly, a strong preference for concentration on ELA only instead of both 
ELA and Math (90 minutes twice a week for ELA), have a concentrated focus on the TEAM 
program instead of dividing the time using Finish Line.  
Our teachers will receive ENL PD on the following dates for the 2018-2019 school 
year:  10/15/18, 10/29/18, 1/28/19, 2/11/19, 3/11/19, 4/29/19.  
The ELL After-school Teacher Study Group dates for the 2018-2019 school year as as

  Title III Part D:  Parental Engagement Activities:   
Parental Engagement activities took place throughout the school year on Tuesdays during Parent 
Engagement time.  Workshops and activities were provided by our ENL team and Literacy and 
Math Coaches for grades K-2 and 3-5.  Our Parent Orientation Meeting on October 18, 2017 
addressed the following topic: The NYSESLAT, Test Results School wide and per grade, the 4 
modalities and How Parents can Support their Children.  Other parent meeting topics were as 
follows:  The CKLA reading/writing program, the Go Math program, our Responsive Classroom 
program in the second year at our school and our Character Education program.  In addition, 
other parent workshops provided opportunities for vocabulary enrichment and supported 
listening and speaking skills during the instructional and question/answer portion of the 
workshop; those workshops were presented by our Art Department teacher, who is bilingual, 
with assistance from our Parent Coordinator; she provided translation as well (at no extra cost to 
Title III).  During that time, we offered ways for parents to support their children and become 
involved in their education.  The Art and Crafts workshops were designed to build community 
with our parents and their children so that parents became familiar with our school, its staff and 
our mission; the workshops were as follows: Halloween Art (10/31/17), Thanksgiving Day Art 
(11/21/17), Holiday Art (12/19/17), Winter Art (1/30/18), Valentine’s Day Art (2/13/18), St.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
In grades K-5, students are assessed using the Fountas & Pinnell leveling system to evaluate students' reading ability; F&P 
assesses comprehension, such a literal and inferential questions, fluency and expression.  In this way, teachers are able to 
determine if a students is using the cuing system and checking for meaning, word patterns, visual cues (unknown words).  This 
system also allows the teacher to be aware of each student's ability to self-correct so that the text makes sense and has 
meaning.  Moreover, comprehension and fluency are important focus areas that  inform the teacher as to a child's strengths 
and areas of need; this allows the teacher to differentiate instruction, provide specific, targeted small group support and/or 
teach a strategy lesson based on their findings.  Analyzing the data of the whole class, the teacher is able to re-teach or revisit 
a lesson and scaffold instruction for ELL students.  In addition, frequently monitoring students who are below, approaching, on 
or above the reading benchmark assists in creating the school's instructional plan for professional development as well as 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

supporting teachers in closing the gap.  The F&P Class-at-a-glance form arranges students by level across the year providing 
the school with additional information and analysis of student progress; this data is collected and analyzed four times a 
year.   Writing assessments are conducted three times a year: baseline, mid-line and end-line.  In addition, our CKLA (Core 
Knowledge Language Arts) program is aligned with the Common Core Standards and provides GRAIR (Guided Reading and 
Independent Reading) in the early grades and independent reading in the upper grades.  During this time of the reading block, 
teachers meet with small groups and/or confer with individual students to address their specific needs.  The CKLA program 
also provides its own assessments that teachers use to evaluate student progress.  In addition, DEAR (Drop Everything and 
Read) time has been incorporated into our daily schedules in order to emphasize the importance of reading daily.   With the 
use of both formative assessments and curriculum-embedded assessment, we are able to guide our instructional planning for 
our ELL students in a rigorous and meaningful way.      
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

At PS 91, we plan our school year in May and June so as to be prepared for the upcoming school year.  We create a calendar 
that teachers receive so that they are aware of assessments and due dates for submitting data results to our literacy coaches 
and administrators.  We also have scheduled Data Talks that take place the second half of the school year so as to determine 
student progress and the steps needed to address concerns so as to best support struggling students.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At PS 91, we evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs by analyzing data from the ELA, Math and NYSESLAT state 
exams.  We also the evaluate the ELA and Math simulations and performance tasks to gather information on how our ELL 
students are progressing as the school year enfolds.  Our areas of need are in reading and writing as  the results indicate on 
the ELA, Math (word problems) and NYSESLAT exams.  We use these findings to focus on instruction in the areas where the 
students need the most support.  Baseline assessments in writing, F&P assessments and Math baselines taken at the beginning 
of the school year enable us to place ELL students in small groups for guided reading, targeted writing and small group support 
in math.  Assessments in the students' home language also help the teachers to understand whether language is the only issue 
impeding student performance or whether there might be an indication of a learning disability.  The success of our ELL 
program is measured by the number of students who reach a score of Commanding on the NYSESLAT, by the number of 
students who progress one or more levels,  and in which modalities we are finding improvements.   We also look at the growth 
students are making on the F&P reading levels throughout the school year and if they are reaching the benchmarks prescribed 
for each grade level (September, Dec/Jan, Feb/March, May/June).  We also assess students in our TBE classes using the BOY 
and EOY HLA periodic assessments.  Finally, we use unit assessments in both the ELA and math programs as well as class work, 
student participation, group work and teacher observations to evaluate the success of our programs for ELL students.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered, teachers are able to group students accordingly; groups for the various content 
areas are flexible and change with each new piece of assessment data.  Tier 1 intervention is provided on a daily, ongoing basis 
through classroom instruction.  If teachers determine a lack of progress or little or no movement, they keep records detailing 
the times/days and minutes of small group instruction.  By late fall, teachers request a meeting with the RTI team to share 
their findings; the team determines next steps and Tier 2 intervention is recommended for a period of 6 weeks, three times a 
week for 30 minutes.  After 6 weeks, a second meeting is scheduled and the RTI team along with the teacher determines how 
to proceed.  In some instances, 6 more weeks of Tier 2 intervention is prescribed; in severe cases, it is determined that the 
student needs an evaluation and a recommendation is made to the School Based-Support Team.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
At PS 91, in order to guide instruction for our ELL students within the RTI framework, we provide daily and consistent Tier 1 
instruction.  Students are given multiple opportunities throughout the day to engage with one another and their teacher 
through Turn and Talk activities as well as Think/Pair/Share activities and triads in small groups.  These activities allow ELL 
students to improve in the two modalities of listening and speaking across the curriculum and throughout the day as these 
structures are part of every class and for every lesson.  At the beginning of the school year, teachers receive the results of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

NYSESLAT so that they are aware of their students' levels according to the scale scores.  They also receive professional 
development so as to understand the results and how they can address the students' needs according to the four 
modalities.  This is the second year that our school has extended the CKLA program to include grades 3-5 thus allowing 
consistency and coherence across the whole school.  Therefore, the components and resources will support ELL students so 
that they are both cognitively challenged and supported in order to achieve success.  ELL students who are not showing 
sufficient progress are targeted early in the school year so that they receive Tier 2 small group instruction in addition to Tier 1 
support.  Tier 2 instruction requires teachers to meet with students for 30 minutes three times a week.  As progress is 
monitored for these students by the RTI team, educational decisions are made that take into account language acquisition and 
background ensuring that our students feel confident enough to become active participants in their learning.   We support 
students with Tier 2 interventions with Headsprout.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data for the 2017 NYSESLAT reveals the following information:  31 or 10% of out 310 students who took the 2017 
NYSESLAT in grades K-5 achieved a level of Commanding. The remaining results are as follows:  157 or 50% of our students in 
grades K-5 reached the Expanding Level; 88 or 28% of our students in grades K-5 reached the Transitioning level; 37 or 12% of 
our students in grades K-5 reached the Emerging Level and 18 or 6% of our students in grades K-5 reached the Entering 
Level.   in the speaking modality.  In grade 3, the results are as follows; 10 students scored low in the writing modality, 0 
students scored low in both the reading and listening modality and 4 students scored low in the speaking modality.  In grade 4, 
the results indicate that 14 students scored low in the writing modality, 0 students scored low in the reading modality; 1 
student scored low in the listening modality and 4 students scored low in the speaking modality.  In grade 5, 7 students scored 
low in the writing modality and 0 students scored low in both the reading and listening modality and 2 students scored low in 
the speaking modality.   
As for ELA data, 10 (3.4%) of ELL students scored at or below the 25th growth percentile and scored at a level 1 or 2 in 
comparison to non-ELL students who scored 17 (3.7%) in the same category.  As for Math data, 2 (0.7%) of ELL students scored 
at or below the 25th growth percentile and scored at a level 1 or 2 in comparison to non-ELL students 13 (2.8%) in the same 
category.  The number of ELL students held over in the past 3 years, 55 (18.6%) is similar to the number of non-ELL students, 
57 (12.4%) in the same category.  Data indicates that the ELL students with at-risk level 3 or greater (61/20.7%) is similar to the 
number of non-ELL students at-risk level 3 or greater (74/16.1%) as ELLs and non-ELL students with at-risk level of 5 or greater: 
ELLs: 29 (9.8%) and non-ELLs: 30 (6.5%).   
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

In order to make adjustments to our programs, we disseminate the findings to our teachers as soon as we receive state exam 
results.  As this information is available prior to the end of the school  year (NYS ELA and Math exams), we are able to create 
our classes for the upcoming school year based on the exam results, class work, teacher input and social/emotional 
knowledge.  We also use the results of the previous year's NYSESLAT scores in addition to the results of the writing scoring for 
the current NYSESLAT in order to place ELL students into the appropriate classes for the upcoming school year.  Test results 
allow us to refer to and use the CKLA program's supplemental guide, which supports students with special needs and our ELL 
students.  Teacher teams also meet to determine which parts of each unit of study are appropriate and which parts need to be 
revised to best meet the needs of our students.     

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

At PS 91, our Standalone ENL program is implemented as per CR Part 154.2 as follows:  The class travels together 
(block) as a heterogeneous group.  They receive 360 ENL minutes at the Entering level, 180 minutes of standalone ENL 
and 180 minutes of integrated ENL.  They receive 360 ENL minutes at the Emerging level, 90 minutes of standalone 
ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL and 90 minutes of Standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content 
area.  They receive 180 ENL minutes at the Transitioning level and 90 minutes of integrated ENL  and 90 minutes of 
Standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area, and 180 ENL minutes at the Expanding level with 
180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

At PS 91, our TBE program consists of three parts:  ENL/ESL, home language arts and 2 subjects in the native language 
at the beginning levels based on the level of student proficiency.  If the proficiency levels are at the higher levels, they 
receive at least one subject in the native language.    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Our school does not have a DL program.     

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           a.  Instructional minutes in each program model are delivered accordingly:  a total of 360 minutes per week at the 
Entering level with 180 minutes in Stand-alone and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA for Entering level students; a total of 
360 minutes per week at the Emerging level with 90 minutes; a total of 180 minutes per week at the Transitioning level with 
90 minutes in Integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes in Stand-alone ENL or Integrated ENL or content area; a total of 180 minutes 
per week at the Expanding level with 180 minutes of ENL/ELA or other content area and a total of 90 minutes per week of 
Integrated ENL in ELA or content area at the Commanding level for former ELL students.    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
At PS 91,  the core content is delivered using the CKLA (Core Knowledge Language Art) program and GO Math. Instruction is 
delivered in English in the CKLA program and translated into the home language for Entering and Emerging students and for all 
other ELLs in TBE classes when necessary.  In TBE classes where students are in the beginning stages of language acquisition, 
the content area courses are taught in the home language.     
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

At PS 91, ELL students are appropriately evaluated in the home language three times throughout the year using the Fountas & 
Pinnel Spanish assessment: at the beginning of the year, mid-year in February and at the end of the year in May/June.     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Differentiated instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups is as follows:  
a. SIFE:  Our school has a total of 12 SIFE students; 3 current ELL students in third grade, 7 current ELL students in fourth grade, 
2 current ELL students in fifth grade. Nine of the SIFE students are at the Entering level and will receive 360 minutes of support 
services as well as one of the Emerging SIFE students.  They will be identified as SIFE students so that their teachers are aware 
that these students have had interrupted education and that they need extra support and close monitoring to determine if 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

they are making progress.  They will be included in small instructional groups, and they will attend after school in order to 
improve their language acquisition in all four modalities.  Moreover, group work is a way to to teach social skills and teamwork 
and to practice speaking and listening in the new language.  In addition, they will receive support in their Home Language 
period on a daily basis so that they can transfer their knowledge of language from their home language to the new language; 
our instructional plan focuses on delivering content and literacy instruction in the home language for Entering and Emerging 
students for at least two content area subjects.  Counseling is also available and has proved to be invaluable in helping our SIFE 
students to adjust to their school environment and level of expectations required by the Common Core Standards.   
b. Newcomer:  Newcomers who have received between 0 and 3 years of service, and who are in a TBE class will receive 
instruction in their home language from a highly qualified certified bilingual teacher.  Newcomer students will receive 360 
minutes of support services and one period per day of Home Language instruction.  In many instances, content in ELA is 
translated and the content area subjects are taught in the home language in TBE classes.  If the newcomers are not Spanish 
speakers, they will receive 360 minutes of support in either a Freestanding ENL class, or they will be provided with 360 
minutes of support (Entering, Emerging) by an ENL provider in a co-teaching integrated model.  In addition, students and 
parents receive homework assignments in their home language which is translated by a bilingual classroom teacher on the 
grade; this practice allows parents to offer support and be involved in their children's school work.  In addition, we send home 
progress reports in the home language so that parents are aware of their children's progress.  Moreover, we provide 
workshops for parents in ELA and Math with translation so that newcomer parents are aware of our curricula.  Newcomer 
students are included in our after school program for ELL students which will offer extra support in language acquisition.   
c. Developing:  Developing students scoring at the Transitioning level on the 2016 NYSESLAT will receive 180 minutes of ENL 
support; 90 minutes of ENL/ELA support and 90 minutes of integrated ENL/content area or Stand-alone support.  As with all of 
our ELL students, students at this level of language acquisition will be provided with classroom support through small 
group/individual and attend an after school program as well.  As teachers have been provided with test score results in all four 
modalities, they will be able to address these students' needs individually.    
d.  Long-term ELLs - We do not have any students who are long-term ELLs at this time at our school. 
e.  Former ELLs - Our school has made accommodations for students who received a score of Commanding on the 
2016 NYSESLAT; those students will receive 90 minutes per week of ENL support as they have been placed in classrooms 
where an ENL teacher is the classroom teacher or an ENL teacher is providing push-in ENL services. Former ELL students also 
receive testing accommodations for two years after securing a score of Commanding. Students who scored Proficient on the 
2015 NYSESLAT will also receive 90 minutes of ENL support a week and be eligible for testing accommodations as well.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
At PS 91, ELL students with disabilities receive services mandated through their IEP (Individual Education Plan). Our ENL 
providers will support ELL students with special needs and collaborate with the special education teachers, speech 
providers,  SETSS providers, occupational therapists, physical therapists, the school psychologist, social worker and guidance 
counselors in order to create the best learning conditions for the ELL-SWD students.  Instructional strategies for ELL students 
with disabilities include significant interaction between the teacher and the student.  Group work allows students to move 
around, interact with one another and take part in whole class or small group discussions and activities in order to build 
confidence and self-esteem.  ELL-SWD students participate in active learning as they are offered hands-on activities that focus 
on strengths and improving capabilities.  Teachers are aware of the students' accommodations and adapt activities so that all 
students have the opportunity to gain access to information in reading, writing and content area subjects; feedback is given 
regularly so that students build an understanding of how to improve their learning.  In addition, ENL providers scaffold oral and 
written instruction, give clear directions, repeated if required, and model how to apply strategies in order to facilitate 
comprehension.  Other strategies will include using visual aids such as pictures, photographs, graphs, graphic organizers, story 
maps or story boards, word mapping and use of the Smart board and other technology to support comprehension.  It is 
universal practice for teachers to provide services for ELL students with disabilities to ask students to repeat directions in their 
own words so that immediate assessment will help determine comprehension and support will be immediately provided.  Our 
ELL-SWD students are given resources to help with study skills, particularly organizational skills.  In addition, they are taught 
time managements skills in order to complete tasks and prepare for standardized tests in ELA, Math and NYSESLAT.  Special 
education teachers refer to each student's IEP and the modifications stated within; however, they follow the curricula as well 
as the requirements outlined in the units of study based on the Common Core State Standards.    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
At PS 91, our school uses curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of students with special 
needs by providing support through the ICT (Integrated Co-teaching model) in grades K-5.  Lessons are linked to students' 
abilities so that there are clear and engaging foci.  Students are allowed to practice skills in a variety of contexts and directions 
and instructions are repeated often throughout lessons in order to assist learning.  Language development activities are 
offered in multi-sensory ways so that students' learning styles are addressed.     
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
At PS 91, our targeted intervention programs for ELL students in ELA, math and other core content areas for Entering, 
Emerging and Transitioning and Expanding students are as follows:  We provide an after-school program two afternoons a 
week for 45 minutes each day (Wednesdays and Thursdays).  The program that we are offering is Language Power, a program 
specifically for our ELL population.  The program also provides differentiated and rich English language development: it is 
anchored by level-appropriate text sets that provide rigorous instruction in the four language domains: listening, speaking, 
reading, and writing. 
In math, our school uses Math in Focus as our targeted intervention program for ELL students at all levels.  This intervention 
takes places two afternoons a week for 45 minutes each day (Wednesdays and Thursdays).  The program offers the following: 
a curriculum with problem solving as the center of math learning and concepts taught through real-world, hands-on 
experiences.  It supports the goals of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, and it Is research-based and focuses 
on classroom learning, discussion, and practice.  In addition, it balances conceptual understanding, visual learning, and 
problem solving.  The program is offered in English.  
 
During our regular school day, our ELL students receive instruction in our CKLA (Core Knowledge Language Arts) and Go 
Math.  In both programs, interventions and scaffolds for ELL students are addressed in the Teacher's Guides.  ELL students 
participate in small and whole group discussions on a daily basis in order to improve their listening and speaking skills as well 
as their ability to think critically and form opinions.  Our push-in ENL providers provide support during the ELA or Math period 
so as to meet the needs of the students in classes where the teacher is not TESL certified.  A co-teaching model is used to 
provide Integrated ENL instruction.      
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

At PS 91, in order to maintain consistency and alignment across grades, our upper grades 3-5 have adopted the CKLA program 
this year.  We believe that choosing the same program for our whole school will provide the same language, concepts and 
ideas and allow students to build on their knowledge of language and learning from year to year.     
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

At this time, we are not planning on discontinuing any programs or services for our ELL students.     
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
At PS 91, our ELL students are afforded equal access to all school programs as we do not exclude them from any of our school 
programs.  We will offer after school two days a week on Wednesdays and Thursdays from October 2016 through May 2017; it 
will consist of 90 minutes, 45 minutes for Math instruction and 45 minutes for ELA instruction from 2:20 to 4:00 pm, ten 
minutes will be provided for snack time. Even though we were pleased with the programs that we used this year 
(Language Power and Math in Focus),  our after-school teachers have decided that they would like to research new programs 
for our after-school ELL classes.  However, we will continue with CKLA and Go Math as our regular school day programs.   In 
addition to our ELL after-school program, our school offers an academic program on Wednesdays and Thursdays for 90 
minutes on each of those days; our ELL students are invited to participate in that program as well if they are not in the ELL 
after-school program.  Moreover, our school offers programs in music, dance, chorus and visual arts, in which many of our ELL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

students belong and participate.  Many of our ELL students learned how to play an instrument this year,  and our music, dance, 
chorus and arts programs will continue to flourish and to include more of our students for the upcoming school year.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
At PS 91, our instructional materials consist of the CKLA program for ELA and the Go Math program for Math.  With regard to 
technology, all of our classrooms have Smart boards, teacher laptops, document cameras and desktop computers.  In addition, 
we have laptop carts on every floor of the building making laptops accessible to all of our students in addition to a computer 
lab on the third floor.  Our school has also purchased iPads for grades 1 and 2 and in Kindergarten, we have purchased Smart 
tables which allows the students to partake in games and activities.  Both instructional materials and technology are used to 
support our ELL students. This year, we ordered big books in Spanish for our Kindergarten and 1st grade TBE classes. We have 
also purchased a research-based phonics book for our bilingual classes as well as leveled Spanish libraries for all of our TBE 
classrooms.  In addition, our school has purchased a new product for the upcoming school year; it is from Santillana for 
elementary school.   It (Yabisi)  is specifically for native Spanish speakers; it integrates technology with language and literacy 
skills development, to develop critical-thinking skills through high-interest readings and language arts activities. It teaches 
language arts through a balanced literacy approach and combines language skills with immediate online application.  We have 
also supported our non-Spanish speaking ELLs by ordering library books across a range of topics to include: sports, home, 
school, transportation and an encyclopedia in Bengali for our Bangladeshi students.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

At PS 91, the  home language  is assessed by Fountas and Pinnell in Spanish and support is delivered for one period a day in our 
TBE classrooms.  ENL support (Stand-alone or push-in ESL) is provided according to 2016 NYSESLAT and the NYSITELL results 
(for newcomers) in all classrooms with ELL students.  Our TBE classroom teachers are provided with materials so as to 
incorporate read alouds to improve listening skills as well as speaking skills though turn and talk activities.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

At PS 91, we use the results from the 2016 NYSESLAT and NYSITELL to ensures that all required services/resources support 
correspond to our ELL students' ages and grade levels.   As stated previously, we comply with the mandated minutes for 
Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding categories as reported on the R-LAT, NYSESLAT Exam History 
Report.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We do not share a building.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
At PS 91, our LPT members (Ms. T Ball Douglas, Ms. A Beccia, Mr. A Barillas Acosta and Ms. S. Rodriguez) meet with newly 
enrolled ELLs and their parents when students pre-register.  At that time, we offer suggestions for preparing for school when 
parents register Kindergarten children in June and July.  We discuss the importance of preparing students for school with 
parents and give them ideas on how to talk about expectations for classroom behavior, cooperation and getting along with 
others, sharing and social skills.  We also recommend summer reading programs at local libraries.  Our parent coordinator, Ms. 
Geormari Cruz, meets with and supports our newly enrolled ELL students and their parents at the beginning of the school and 
throughout the school year as new arrivals register at our school. ELL parents are invited for an orientation meeting at the 
beginning of the school year where they learn about our school's reading, writing and math programs as well as the NYSESLAT 
and ELA and Math state exams.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

At PS 91, we do not offer language electives to ELL students.     
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We do not have a dual language program at PS 91.     
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
At PS 91, our professional development plan addresses reading, which is our school's instructional focus as well as writing and 
language acquisition. This plan encompasses all teachers at our school including teachers of ELL students; we hope to improve 
teaching practice in reading and writing instruction in order to raise student outcomes and close the achievement gap.  We 
also hope to provide professional development that will address language acquisition so that all of our teachers will become 
familiar with the concepts, methodologies and strategies that will not only improve their instructional practice but also give 
them better insight in addressing the needs of all learners of the English language.  As a result, independent reading and 
Guided Reading are expected to be evident in all classrooms on a daily basis.  We have incorporated DEAR (Drop Everything 
and Read) into our programs for one period every day.  We hope to observe teachers implementing the information that they 
receive during the professional development sessions on language acquisition, reading & writing strategies and speaking and 
listening strategies.  In addition, our ENL teachers and our administrator provided professional development based on 
information that they received during summer and/or PD opportunities  that were offered throughout the school year from 
the Office of ELLs.  The topics were as follows:  How to Interpret NYSESLAT scores and the Implications for Instruction; 
NYSESLAT test prep: Writing Rubrics and Checklists; Building Writing Skills from Speaking Skills; Writing to Build 
Community;  Practical Tools to Build Academic Language Across the Content Areas: Content and Language Objectives to Drive 
Instruction for Students who are Learning English as a New Language; New York State Common Core Initiative: New Language 
and Home Language Arts Progressions and NYSESLAT testing Procedures and Protocols (8 Monday PD workshops).  
At PS 91, our academic programs, CKLA for ELA and Go Math for our math instruction is Common Core aligned. When planning, 
our teachers include the learning standards in their lesson plans so as to make certain that the standards are being addressed 
throughout their lessons.  If teachers of ELL students require professional development in supporting their students as they 
engage in the Common Core Learning Standards, we provide support through literacy and math teacher teams and grade 
planning meetings.  Teachers (including TBE teachers and ENL teachers) collaborate on how best to provide instruction that 
meets students needs and also meets the requirements of the learning standards.  Our efforts are collaborative so that 
teachers feel supported.  In addition, during pre and post observations, our administrators discuss the need for meeting 
learning standards in each class.  This year our TBE teachers met with Patricia Maldonado, a bilingual consultant for 
Generation Ready,  to provide Q-tel strategies for building academic vocabulary and discussion; this PD spanned over 5 
sessions and was provided to our 3-5 TBE teachers.  Our professional development plan offered for all teachers of ELLs 
supported ELL students as they engaged in the Common Core Learning Standards.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
At PS 91, our guidance counselors assist all students including ELL students as they transition from elementary to middle 
school.  Our 3-5 Guidance Counselor  supports our students in the application process for middle schools, meets with parents 
to explain the process and uses translation services from our ENL staff and parent coordinator so that there is a clear 
understanding of what is expected from students and parents.  Our 3-5 guidance counselor distributes information on Middle 
School Fairs and information sessions on how to apply to middle school.  In addition, she makes school announcements

reminding students of upcoming information sessions, dates and locations.  Translation of the information is made available 
for speakers of other languages.      
At PS 91, our school will meet the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual/ENL teachers as prescribed by CR Part 80. 15% of the required professional 
development hours will be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and 
integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.  For all bilingual and ENL teachers, 50% of the 
required professional development hours will be dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area 
instruction including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for 
English Language Learners.  On June 2, 2017, our assistant principal attended professional development: Co-Teaching 
Symposium: Looking Back to Move Ahead provided by the NYS/NYC Regional Bilingual Education Resource Network at 
Fordham University.  Our school plans to meet with the ENL team to review the information received from the meeting and 
determine how we will address Integrated Co-Teaching in our ENL classrooms.  To begin with, our first ENL/Bilingual Teachers 
meeting took place on October 24, 2016, to address the 2016 NYSESLAT results, student levels and scale scores and how to use 
that information to determine small group instruction and to address the four modalities.   Our professional development 
sessions will take place on PD Mondays.  We will conduct professional development throughout the school year with a focus 
on writing and speaking/listening strategies and of the NYSESLAT with a focus on NYSESLAT writing and the writing rubric so as 
to address the needs of  all of our ELLs. Our PD dates were as follows: 10/24/16, 10/31/16, 11/14/16, 11/28/16, 2/6/17, 
2/13/17, 3/13/17 and 4/3/17.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
At PS 91, our school provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program (Reading and 
Math at separate workshops) language development progress (NYSESLAT Parent Report explaining results, levels and scale 
scores and how they translate into levels), language proficiency results (Emerging, Entering, Transitioning, Expanding and 
Commanding levels), and language development needs in all content areas (Integrated ENL and how it will address instruction 
in English language skills in ELA and content areas subjects).  All communication with parents including memos, calendars, 
notices and letters are sent home in both Spanish and English.  Translation is offered whenever needed by our ENL staff (See 
below).  All pertinent information is also posted on the Parent Bulletin Board at the main entrance of the school as well as on 
the doors and hallways of the mini-school building in both Spanish and English.  We use the School Messenger service to notify 
parents of school events and school closings.  This service provides translation to our parents in many different languages.  In 
addition, every member of our office staff is bilingual and, therefore, able to communicate with parents and assist teachers, 
guidance counselors and other staff members in communicating with parents.  In addition, our LPT team has three members 
that are bilingual in Spanish and English.  On every Tuesday of the school year, we have Parent Engagement time from 2:20 to 
3:00 pm.  During this time, teachers reach out to parents by phone or make appointments with individual parents in order to 
address the goals of the program, discuss individual children's progress, areas for concern and ideas for parents on how to 
support children at home.  Discussions also include language proficiency assessment results and language development needs 
in all content areas.  Our bilingual teachers are available for interpretation and translation as needed during parent 
engagement time. On September 22, 2016, we conducted Back to School evening from 4:30 to 7:30.  We provided translation 
in all classrooms when needed.  We introduced our enrichment teachers and explained our special programs in music, chorus 
and band.At that time, our bilingual/ENL staff provided translation when needed.     
In addition, PS 91 makes ongoing attempts to work closely with our ELL parent population in a variety of ways.  To begin with, 
on October 14 , 2016, we had our ELL parent orientation meeting. In addition, in conjunction with our parent coordinator, our 
coaches, service providers and faculty provided workshops for our ELL parents on the following dates/topics:  October 20, 
2016, Speech Services Workshop (Culbert & Silva - Speech teachers); November 9, 2016, Child Abuse (McCartney -Guidance 
Counselor);   November 15, 2016, Health Lessons (Levine & Pagan-Physical Ed teachers); January 24, 2017, Exploring Math K-2

teachers and PC); May 25 & June 19, 2017, Dreamyard for Parents (Dance instructor & Cruz).  In addition, our Art teachers 
(Pimentel and Barbosa) provided nine workshops centered on holiday art.  Moreover, we provided ENL classes for parents 
from October, 2016 through May, 2017 from 2:20 to 3:30 to support our non-English speaking parents.  During that time, we 
provide child-care services in order to give our parents an opportunity to attend the sessions.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
At PS 91, we offer a parent survey which is distributed and collected by our Parent Coordinator in order to determine parents' 
needs.  Once we have that information, we address common issues or concerns at our parent workshops or on an individual 
basis as needed or requested.  At PS 91, it is our goal to create a welcoming, informative community that addresses the social 
and academic needs of all our students and families.  In order to foster parent involvement, our school offers arts and crafts 
parent workshops throughout the school year for special occasions such as Mother's Day, Father's Day and holidays.  In 
addition, we celebrate our Greatest Guardians on June 6, 2017 and our Spring Culture Dinner, June 20, 2017, to which faculty 
and staff provide homemade food from their native countries along with our parents.   Moreover, our parents are invited to all 
of our school's performances for orchestra, chorus and dance as well as to our awards assemblies and for breakfast to 
celebrate our students who receive recognition for displaying admirable characteristics that support our Character Education 
program (4 times a year).  These specific and important activities foster parent involvement for parents of ELLs throughout the 
school year.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Meridith Struhl Nasjletti, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities 
are adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The data and methodologies that are used to assess our schools written translation and oral interpretation needs 
comes from the Home Language Survey which is completed at registration by each parent. Since the data 
indicates that the majority of our school's ELL parents are Spanish-speaking, we make certain that all of our 
written communication is translated into Spanish so that our parents are provided with appropriate information 
in a language that they can understand in a timely manner. We rely on oral interviews at the time of registration 
as well as the information gleaned from the Student Emergency Contact cards. In addition, we provide oral 
interpretation services whenever needed, such as at registration, Parent/Teacher Conferences, Curriculum 
Workshops and Meet and Greets, informal parent/teacher meetings, and at school assemblies, celebrations and 
graduations. The NYSESLAT Parent Report is also sent home in both languages so that parents are aware of how 
their children scored on the state English exam for language learners. Furthermore, School Messenger is utilized 
so that if there is a need, interpretation services are provided in any of the covered languages. With regard to 
parents who speak languages other than Spanish and who require written translation and/or oral interpretation, 
we have designated Geormari Cruz, Parent Coordinator as our Language Access Coordinator. She attended LAC 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

training on January 19, 2017. The training prepared her to support our school in monitoring our parents' language 
needs; it has also helped her to identify school staff who are qualified and available to provide interpretation 
assistance. In addition, she will be trained on how to allocate funding to provide language assistance if needed 
and also learn how to inform parents of the availability of language assistance services. Using the information 
from the RHLA report (Home Language Report) and the RCPL, it is evident that our population is predominately 
Spanish speaking with a small group of (21) students from Bengali speaking families. Therefore, we will rely on our 
Spanish bilingual pedagogues to support our Spanish speaking student/parent population. We will contact the 
Translation and Interpretation Unit for support for our second biggest population of non-English speakers if 
needed so as to ensure that our Bengali-speaking parents are fully informed. We will also use the Over-the-Phone 
Interpretation resource to support our Bengali-speaking families is needed.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

The major findings of our school's 
written translation and oral 
interpretation needs are gathered 
from the Home Language Survey. We 
have reported these findings at the 
School Leadership Team meetings, 
Parent Association meetings, and the 
Title I Parent meetings. Therefore, the 
school community is kept informed of 
the latest information regarding our 
school's ELL population. Parents are 
informed of the percentage of our ELL 
population attending PS 91 as 
compared to the total population of 
the school. Presently, our school ELL 
population consists of 40% of our total 
school population, or 312 ELL 
students. Our school's languages other 
than Spanish (362) is as follows: 
English (240) Bengali (21),French (4), 
French-Haitian Creole (1), Fulani (1),

conference day/evenings (September 22, 2016, November 3, 2016, 
March 9, 2017, May 17, 20176), official holidays throughout the 
school year, after-school program for ELL students (October 19, 2016) 
fliers announcing ESL parent classes, curriculum workshops in Math 
and English Language Arts as scheduled by the Parent Coordinator, 
New York State testing dates as indicated in the testing calendar and 
any letters from administration to parents. Written translation 
services are provided by a highly qualified in-house certified 
pedagogue who is bilingual and has the ability to translate 

The general rule 
that our school 
follows is that ten 
day before an 
event is to take 
place, a letter/flier 
will be sent home 
in both languages.

receive information at the same time as the non-ELL parents. If there 
is a need to translate parent letters into a language other than 
Spanish, we will contact the Translation and Interpretation Unit of 
the DOE in order to provide the necessary information for parents 
who speak languages other than Spanish and who request written 
translation. If the Translation and Interpretation Unit services are 
unavailable, we would contact an outside vendor to provide written 
translation if necessary.

2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as 

parent-teacher  
conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.  
   

Meeting Name  

Month/Frequency 

of Meetings  

Our school will have formal face-to-face meetings with parents 
throughout the school year such as Parent-Teacher Conferences on 
the following dates: September 22, 2016, November 3, 2016, March 
9, 2017 and May 17, 2017. As for any anticipated informal 
interactions with an attendance teacher (bilingual) or guidance 
counselor, we request a pedagogue (A. Barillas Acosta, A. Beccia, S 
Rodriguez) from our ENL team or a bilingual school secretary to 
translate for parents. We also suggest that parents bring a family 
member or friend to the meetings so that the parent feels 
comfortable and confident. As for phone calls, our guidance 
counselors request translation from one of our bilingual pedagogues 
so that all information is clearly disseminated.  

The general rule 
that our school 
follows is that ten 
days before an 
event is to take 
place, a flier will 
be sent home in 
both languages. A 
reminder is sent 
home the week of 
the event.  

How does your 
school plan to 

provide 

interpretation 

service(s)?  

During our 
Parent/Teacher 
Conferences, 
we assign 
bilingual staff 
members to 
particular 
teachers who 
will be in need 
of 
interpretation 
services. We 
also assign 
bilingual 
teachers to 
each floor of 
the school 
building in 
order to ensure 
that 
interpreters 
are available 
if/when 
needed. 
Teachers are 
provided with

there is no one 
on staff who 
has the ability 
to translate 
into the 
parent's home 
language.  

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of a school emergency, all of our school's office secretaries are bilingual in English/Spanish; therefore, 
they would be instrumental in communicating with limited-English-proficient families. Our parent coordinator who is 
also English/Spanish bilingual would also be required to support communication in the event of an emergency.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Our school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 by informing 
them that limited-English-speaking parents are provided with a meaningful opportunity to participate and have access 
to programs and services critical to their child's education. This information will be disseminated at our first staff 
meeting on Wednesday, September 6, 2017. At that time, they will be given the Over-the-Phone Interpretation phone 
number (1-800-231-0288) and code (109091) for our school to be used by DOE employees only.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Our school will fulfill parental notification requirements for translation and interpretation services as per Section VII of 
Chancellor's Regulation A-663 by posting all pertinent information such as phone number for language assistance 
from the Translation and Interpretation Unit (718-752-7373). In addition, our school will post the over-the-phone 
interpretation services number in our main vestibule, in our mini-building entrance and on our parent bulletin board. 
The flier is available to all staff for Over-The-Phone-Interpretation (1-800-231-0288) with the school code: 109091.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 
 

Our school will use the information gleaned from the Home Language Survey in order to determine language 
preferences. In addition, in order to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services, we will 
refer to the parent survey. This information will help us determine our parents' needs and how/if they are being met 
in a timely manner.
