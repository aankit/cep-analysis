Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

At Harlem Renaissance High School, our mission as a team is to enable students who are over-aged and under-
credited, who often lack the confidence and skills to compete in traditional settings. Our goal is to provide students 
with resources and supports to become successful and collaborative problem solvers, equipping them to address real 
world complexities with integrity and accountability to create pathways for their own success.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 
 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The school wide grading policy emphasizes our focus on culminating assignments (10% Do Now, 30% Class Work and 
Homework, 35% Participation:Speaking and Listening, 25% Benchmark Assessment). We continue this exploration 
with additional resources to integrate the recording studio in student's daily programs, develop both the economic 
and environmental benefits of sustaining and maintaining a year round operational greenhouse and garden, the 
creation of the Harlem Renaissance Media Center that will focus on the creation school-wide news team that would 
include, weekly news video production, journalism class, video editing and producing programs, credit bearing PM 
Classes, Saturday Regents Prep classes, Daily tutoring offered by the LPP Hunter College partnership, year round 
internships supported by LTW, a "limited run' Harlem Renaissance High School student created logo competition 
twice a year, and elective courses which focus on college and career readiness skills, a foundations course focusing on 
the four basic language acquisition skills (speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing), public speaking and social and 
emotional activities to support individual student specific needs.  

 

We partner with Community Based Organizations to further enrich ties between our students and the wider New York 
City community. The New York City Mission Society oversees our Learning to Work program which provides job 
training, paid internships, career workshops, and college preparation for our students. Hunter College Liberty 
Partnership Program provides a social worker, a garden coordinator, social work interns, tutoring, and college access 
resources. Street Corner Resources coordinates our “I Am Peace” Recording Studio and our participation with NYC 
anti-gun violence initiatives. We also work with Marquis Studios as an arts partner, Harlem Hospital, The 100 Schools 
Project, Youth Leaders for College Access and Mount Sinai Adolescent Health. 

 

Each Community Based Organization ("CBO") is integrated seamlessly into the school community. This collaboration 
with DOE staff offers a unified approach for all Harlem Renaissance staff to ensure that we are supporting the needs 
of students by our high expectations for student success beyond high school.  

 

Historically we have had particular success with our ENL and IEP populations who come consistently, often attaining a 
higher graduation rate among this subgroup than our General Education students. This school year, we will 
strategically schedule our IEP students in greater number in specific content area classes where we can focus ICT 
instruction in a more systematic and comprehensive approach. We plan on continuing to support our ENL population 
by offering additional 'stand alone' ENL courses throughout the year in addition to the content specific courses.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

There are currently 17% ELLs at Harlem Renaissance. Approximately 54% of students receive SETSS, and 
approximately 28.28% of students have IEPs or 504 plans. 
. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.

This year we are focusing on the Danielson Framework for Teaching components 3d (assessment) by implementing a 
schoolwide benchmark assessment practice combined with strategies for student self-assessment in classrooms.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

 

 In reviewing observation feedback during the past school year, feedback pertaining to questioning and 
discussion has increased based upon the MOTP ratings generated in July 2018. Assessment techniques have 
had less of an increase, but data has shown we are making progress to improve in this specific Danielson 
element. Will continue to incorporate and strengthen additional formative and summative strategies 
during weekly PDs as well as through teaching coaching which includes, the PCT, Teacher Leader and UFT 
Resource Center Coach. 

  Data from observations for the 2017 - 2018 school year show that teachers who were more effective in 

Domain 3d, as compared to domains 3b and 3c components by .05% and .10% respectively. 

  To address domains 3b and 3c, the 2017-2018 Quality Review provided the following feedback, "The 

principal has stated that it was noticed that there was a great deal of teacher-directed instruction in social 
studies. As a result, observation comments reflected instructional practices to address these concerns as 
the initiative was to move towards a more student-led form of instruction. An informal observation 
feedback included, “As you elicit student responses, you may have a student document student-elicited 
response on the SMARTboard or on chart paper.” Additional responses to support student-led teaching 
that was documented in another informal observation included, “Invite students to respond to other 
students comments by handing out questions in advance to allow students to ease into the conversation.” 
We continue to build upon the Student Engagement Learning Model integrated during last year by focusing 
on more student led discussion strategies and techniques which will include the development of a 
weekly/bi-weekly Project Based Learning Curriculum designed for each content area. 

  Our PCT supported the Professional Development for the 2017-2018 School Year. We focused on meta-

cognition strategies to address the low Regents results from the prior two years. Based upon this model, 
our Regents data improved from June 2017 to January 2018 indicating.  

  The 2018 -2019 School Year will introduce/re-introduce an AP For All ELA class that will expand to at least 

two classes by June, 2018. We have also been given a Math AP for All for Itinerant teacher who train a 
Math teacher in the planning and methodologies of teaching an AP For All Math class for the 2019 - 2020 
School year.  
In end of year conferences with teachers, over half of teachers requested specific practices to be shared at 
professional development relating to address specific individual Danielson components and the continued 
practice of The Student Engagement Learning Model that is based upon the Workshop Teaching Model.  
 Our primary focus the 2018 - 2019 School year will be to focus on the Quality Review Indicators that were 
rated Developing. those Indicators were as follows: 1.2, 3.1, 2.2 and 4.2.

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Students enrolled in English (EET5/6/7/8) and Grade Global History will produce a for each course for the three terms. 
The essays will be graded using the CCLS-aligned rubric. Our goal is a 5% average improvement from the Fall 2018 to 
Spring 2019 in both English and Social Studies, graded June 2018.

The administration will visit each classroom for one round of 
non-file observations providing feedback via email and in person 
on 3d. This allows for a baseline assessment of practice at the 
start of the year and begins authentic discussions about practice, 
not impacted by the pressure of evaluations which go to file.  

Professional Development activities and teacher-lead Best 
Practices workshops will emphasize strategies to teach 
argumentative writing and/or the use of task specific rubrics. 
While teachers choose from a menu of workshops during Best 
Practices periods (C6), at least one workshop offered in every 
session will focus on the aforementioned skills.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
To improve positive two-way communication with all families, TBD {Parent Coordinator} will call, email or write to 
families monthly with positive information about their child, instead of only reaching out with negative or challenging 
information. During this time administration will invite families to discuss student progress, share insights that may 
support teachers in working with their child, and to try at home activities to support learning. Progress will be 
measured towards this goal by tracking outreach in a communication log, taking notes during family meetings, and 
collecting sign-in sheets from events.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
A Pre-assessment exam will be given three times a year (November 2018). 

  Progress reports will be generated twice a trimester throughout the school year to track average student 

credit accumulation 

  We will monitor credit accumulation throughout school year by focusing on incremental credit accumulation 

for all students each trimester. The data will collected at the end of each Trimester as follows: 

  Trimester 1 = 09/05 - 12/04 Progress Report = 10/18 
Trimester 2 = 12/05 - 03/05 Progress Report = 01/17 

Trimester 3 = 03/06 - 06/26 Progress Report = 04/30 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
The benchmark measurement will be graded, and a 2% increase of student scores from the trimester one benchmark 
will show adequate progress toward the goal. 

 

Student benchmark data will be produced at the conclusion of each Trimester.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

 Attendance data 2013-14: 60%, 2014-15: 60% 2015-16: 57% 2016-17 % 2018-19 % 

 The data above shows that our attendance slides lower throughout the year, if we are able to keep the rate up in 
the spring that would be an indication of a victory over the trends in the past three years 

 In an end of year survey teachers indicated attendance as the #1 issue underlying all other issues in the school 

 In a survey of transfer school principals attendance was identified at the #1 issue across all schools 

 Attendance is significant challenge for our students, and impacts their academic growth. School wide attendance 
dropped from the high of 72% average attendance in September to 40% in June. Most months showed a steady 
decline from the initial start of the year high. Significant work is needed to maintain high levels of student 
engagement and motivation. 

 On-time arrivals are also a significant challenge. Average on-time arrival closely tracks with attendance: in 
September, approximately 1/3 of our students arrived before the start of school). By June, only 15% of our students 
arrived by the start of school. Most months showed slow but steady decline from start of year high. 

 During the Transfer School Conference in June 2018, Eskolta consultants shared in an attendance workshop that in 
a broad analysis of transfer school data, frequent live phone calls have proved most effective in producing outcomes, 
even more than home visits. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2018, the Class of 2018 (surveyed in August at the end of the 2016-2017 year) will give five percentage points 
more positive responses than the Class of 2017 (surveyed in November, after applications are complete but before 
results are known) on a college process satisfaction survey.

 At our school teachers are the leaders and administration provides support to expand teacher leadership. As such 
administration leads by example, clarifying teacher misconceptions about student learning just the same way 
teachers are expected to address student misconceptions without negative judgement.  

 Administration participates in the same inquiry process during professional development as do teachers by meeting 
with an administrative inquiry team focused on school attendance. 

 Administration looks at data school wide to identify one area to model leadership and partnership expansion across 
the school. The data below shows some of the data reviewed in choosing the leadership goal for the year. 

 Hunter College Liberty Partnership Program (HCLPP) provided 73 Harlem Renaissance students with tutoring by a 
current college student, for more than 250 hours of tutoring and mentoring over the course of the school year. 

 The NYC Mission Society Learning to Work program provided 73 students with college preparation, including 
working with students and parents to complete FAFSA applications; working with students on all aspects of college 
applications; and providing SAT study sessions and test registration assistance. 

 In 2017 - 18, We focused on improving our Regents pass rates. Many of our students need the skills to overcome 
larger gaps in their foundational academic abilities. Literacy and reading on grade level continue to be a challenge 
for our students, and impact all subject areas. The incorporation of a reading literacy class will be implemented 
during the 2nd trimester to focus on those students who are reading below a 6th grade reading level. An 
assessment exam will be administered to determine eligible students. 

 Regents data will be provided.

 Learning Environment Survey 100% of surveyed parents were satisfied with their “opportunities to be involved in 
your child’s education;” given the low participation in parent-teacher conferences this suggests that the families are 
not accustomed to high levels of school engagement, a significant opportunity for growth and expanded support for 
our students.  

 Over 1600 Parent Outreach attempts were logged by staff and teachers this year, with approximately 1/3 (~550) 
resulting in direct engagement (i.e., not a voicemail) 

 SLT members agreed that parent-teacher conferences are a critical time for parents to engage in their students’ 
education, particularly with respect to establishing a plan for student graduation and post-graduation. 

 A student survey given by our Student Voice Collaborative students showed that over half of our students would be 
interested in participating in study groups outside of class time. 

 Additionally, 43% of students told our Student Voice Collaborative students that they would like more college trips 
planned throughout the school year.

Section 7: Support for Students in Temporary Housing (STH)  

 

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

 

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
All new hires are screened by a teacher-led hiring committee which includes a required demonstration lesson in front 
of our students. Students and teachers debrief these demonstration lessons to inform hiring decisions.  

Significant PR efforts including our community EXPO events, weekly appearances on WHCR radio, our school website 
which has a strong online presence with music and videos produced by our students help the community know about 
our school and help bring larger numbers of applicants to us.  

Specific language has been crafted by teachers and administration for posting positions making clear our community 
expectations for teachers. These expectations include our summer retreat, weekly meetings, teacher-driven inquiry 
work, unit planning, and the demands of working with a transfer school population.  

The school includes a significant number of former New York City Teaching Fellows, including the principal, and our 
unique relationship with that office helps us recruit the best new teachers. 

A strong relationship with our UFT district representative helps us identify highly qualified and experienced 
candidates for open positions. 

When we attend any hiring fair we bring our school banners, video projection highlighting videos of our teachers in 
action, and our brochures which result in our booth always standing out in a singular way among all represented 
schools.  

New teachers are supported with a colleague-mentor as well as by weekly meetings with administration and an open 
door policy to address issues as they arise.  

A detailed staff handbook helps orient new staff to our community norms. Additionally, we hold weekly meetings, 
monthly meetings and daily morning meetings to help new teachers get Just In Time support for their work by 
colleagues of the same department, and the same phase. New staff are also supported by a small professional 
assignment team which meets at least three times each day. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

A secure online staff website provides up-to-date resources for teachers, school event calendars, links to key websites 
and other important supports (lesson plans, citywide instructional expectations, inquiry templates, etc.). 

External consultants are hired as needed for individual departments and at times a consultant has been brought in 
just to support new teachers. 

Regular staff “circles” and retreats provide an opportunity for extended, in-depth conversations among faculty 
members. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
In order to facilitate building knowledge within disciplines, our professional development has three components:  

(a) small group professional assignments;  

(b) weekly departmental planning time;  

(c) online resources.  

Note that these three elements are related in the following ways:  

Many professional assignments are focused on exploring formative assessment strategies, creating a natural link 
between (a) and (b).  

The most successful formative assessments in (b) allow students to self-assess which creates the need post rubrics 
and other resources online for students to easily access. 

Detailed narrative of each component  

(a) Each trimester each teacher (school-wide) will submit an “professional assignment” according to a schedule of 
time-bound deliverables, completed during teacher C6/professional time  

(b) Each Monday teachers will meet by department to compile and analyze a single formative assessment from that 
week, gauging a specific CCLS-aligned sub-skill, and arriving at interventions to increase student outcomes on the 
performance task. Such data driven planning deepens teachers’ authentic use of formative assessment data. While 
the small group projects (a) will represent one initiative per trimester, the collection and analysis of formative 
assessment data will take place each week, across all units. 

(c) The third major structure being adopted this year addresses students’ academic and personal skills relative to the 
more challenging CCLS-aligned performance tasks. As a transfer school many students have inconsistent attendance 
and poor management of handouts previously distributed. These realities disrupt classrooms as students arrive and 
struggle to get on track with project-based work or ask for additional copies of rubrics or task paperwork. By being 
able to access classroom resources online, students will be directed to reference these resources, leaving the teacher 
free to answer content-specific questions. This also will prevent teachers from being distracted by previously absent 
students in the first fifteen minutes of class. This intentional transition from “hand holding” to “handing over” 
responsibility to students to monitor and assess their own learning is also a vital skill for college and professional life 
and will raise the bar in student performance on the CCLS-aligned performance tasks.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

These efforts will be coordinated and integrated with other supports including the CFN, PCT coach and administration 
to ensure that we: 

 Coordinate and collaborate with administrative leads (Principal, AP, and/or Program Director) 

 Track progress towards meeting the projects’ goals 

Share the project, and progress towards meeting the goals with the larger school community

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
In the spring of 2018 teachers participated in a series of feedback sessions and focus groups which led to a redesign of 
our course sequences, separating courses into two groups: culminating and Regents courses. Teachers designed the 
Regents courses to include regular benchmark assessments against which departments will monitor progress to 
mastery of required material. In culminating courses teachers monitor culminating assignments with formative 
assessment practices. During weekly professional development teachers work in lesson study teams to analyze their 
student work resulting from these assessments.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

The School Local Measures Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the principal about the use and 
selection of appropriate multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use 
of assessment results to improve instruction.  

The teacher body unanimously selected the members of the School Local Measures Committee which met in the 
summer before the start of the school year and during the first weeks of the school year to propose and finalize a plan 
for the academic year. The principal adopted all of the committee’s recommendations. Teacher teams have since 
taken responsibility for implementing the recommendations agreed to at the start of the school year. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Harlem Renaissance High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community.  

 

Harlem Renaissance High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand; 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.

Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children 
who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent 
Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central 
office.;

Harlem Renaissance is a transfer school and specifically serves students who have left their previous 
high school and/or fallen behind in credits. All of our ELLs can benefit from additional support, 
especially with the reading and writing demands of Social Studies and English Language Arts classes. 
In response to this, the direct instruction part of the program focuses on honing academic language, 
specifically as it connects to those content areas. Specifically, students will be given various language 
learning resources and individualized support. Since our student population is highly diverse in terms of 
their strengths, preferences, and areas for improvement, the supplemental program will offer students a 
high level of choice and differentiation. The rationale behind this is that it will help all students develop 
skills, especially in reading and writing, which are crucial across the curriculum. Furthermore, we have 
several long-term ELLs and students who were identified as SIFE. We are confident that the additional 
support will be especially helpful for these students. 
 
Supplemental support is open to all ELLs. We currently have 30 ELLs with students at all proficiency 
levels. Specifically, we have 1 Entering level student, 1 Emerging level student, 12 Transitioning level 
students, and 14 Expanding level students. Like all of our students, our ELLs are programmed 
according to their academic requirements, rather than being grouped by grade. In terms of official grade 
level, 4 students are in grade 10, 10 students are in grade 11. and 16 students are in grade 12. In addition 
to these students, we have 11 students who have "tested out," but are still entitled to receive 
accommodations and ENL support. The supplemental support is open to these students, too. The 
rationale for this is that students will provide valuable peer to 
peer reinforcing our Instructional Focus.  Students will support the Student Engagement Learning model 
that  focuses on the four (4) language acquisition skills (Reading, Writing, Speaking and Lisenting). It is 
also worth noting that based on the obligations many of our students have, such as work and/or 
parenting, not all students are likely to be able to take advantage of the supplemental support.  
 
Instruction will be exclusively in English, because we have students with a variety of language 
backgrounds. One-on-one home language support will be provided when possible and pedagogically 
appropriate. 
After school supplemental instruction will begin on October 20th, 2018 and is offered on Wednesdays, 
Thursdays, and Fridays. Instruction begins after the end of the regular school day (2:36 pm) and runs for 
two hours. It is our plan to offer after-school instruction for the duration of the entire school year. After 
school instruction is conducted by a certified ENL teacher. The ENL teacher will be paid using 100% of 
the Title III allocation ($12,366). Title III funding will not need to be used to pay a supervisor.  
 
Materials used for this supplemental program include teacher-created resources, as well as resources 
made available by the New York State Education Department, the New York City Department of 
Education, and other institutions. These resources are currently available and have been paid using other 
funding sources.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The teachers at Harlem Renaissance High School use various forms of teacher-created assessments to inform their instruction 
and planning. The nature of the assessment varies from teacher to teacher and depending on the subject.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teachers are free to create or select assessments as they see fit for their classes.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The most important source of information to identify a baseline, student progress, and areas of need are the NYSITELL and 
NYSESLAT scores of our ELLs. These scores inform our instruction and programming as a baseline. We also consider the 
progress in terms of our students' English proficiency levels according to NYSESLAT scores overall, as well as in the individual 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

subcategories (Reading, Writing, Speaking, and Listening). The ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) also informs us specifically about 
which areas our students are making more or less progress, pointing to areas of need. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

By analyzing NYSESLAT and NYSITELL scores, we can determine whether a student's English proficiency has improved or not. 
By analyzing this data, we can determine which students are not progressing as desired and identify ways to provide these 
students with more support.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
As discussed, we review NYSESLAT scores to inform the program and instruction of our ELLs. We use the RLAT function on 
ATS to view these scores. These scores serve us as a baseline, to measure progress, and identify areas of need. The ELL Data 
Analysis Tool allows us to gain a more detailed understanding of our students' progress and needs. For instance, this tool 
identifies long-term ELLs and at-risk students. We also review Regents results to inform our programming and instructional 
decisions for ELLs.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

These findings are disseminated to the programmer to be considered for programming decisions. These findings are also 
shared with the administration and reviewed by the ENL teacher in order to inform planning. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Harlem Renaissance offers only ENL. All content classes at HRHS are ungraded. Integrated ENL is offered in the form 
of push-in / co-teaching by the content teacher and the ENL teacher. These classes consist of ELLs at various 
proficiency levels and general education students. Standalone ENL instruction is delivered by the ENL teacher. The 
standalone setting is also ungraded and heterogeneously grouped.     

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Proficiency levels, as indicated by NYSITELL/NYSESLAT scores, are used to determine the required instructional minutes of 
ENL. This information informs the push-in schedule for the ENL teacher and the course schedule for the students. According to 
the ELL Policy and Reference Guide, the ENL requirements in terms of weekly minutes for the respective proficiency levels are 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

as follows: Entering (540), Emerging (360), Transitioning (180), Expanding (180), Commanding (90). Of these totals, these 
numbers of minimum minutes are required in the form of standalone ENL: Entering (180), Emerging (90), Transitioning (0), 
Expanding (0), Commanding (0). Moreover, the following numbers of minimum minutes are required in the form of integrated 
ENL: Entering (180), Emerging (180), Transitioning (90), Expanding (180), Commanding (90). Finally, the following numbers of 
minutes can come in either of the two forms: Entering (180), Emerging (90), Transitioning (90), Expanding (0), Commanding 
(0).  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Integrated and standalone ENL services are informed by the understanding that language and content learning should go hand 
in hand. Both aim to facilitate English language development as well as success in a content area as defined by the 
applicable learning standards. The content is delivered in English. When it is feasible and pedagogically sound, teachers may 
provide home language support to the student in the form of home language materials or support. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Several teachers are sufficiently proficient in Spanish to evaluate Spanish-language student work when this is pedagogically 
sound. We also offer various forms of home language support resources that allow students to engage in content while using 
their home language. This includes dictionaries and various digital resources. Moreover, most of our students are able to take 
Regents exams in their home language if they wish, with the exception of the ELA exam.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Instruction, materials, and assessments are differentiated in push-in and standalone settings based on the teachers' 
understanding of and data about student-specific strengths and weaknesses. Students are not strictly grouped according to 
the above categories, but ENL service differentiation is informed by an understanding of these subgroups. Depending on the 
individual circumstance, a student may receive more home language support, as well as more scaffolding in assessment and 
instruction. As mentioned, the students' individual background and experience are important considerations for teachers' 
instructional decisions. SIFE, Newcomers, Developing ELLs, Long Term ELLs, and former ELLs for up to two years are also given 
testing accommodations.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The ENL teacher and content teachers collaborate with the Special Education teachers to meet the needs of ELL-SWDs, both 
those which are described in the IEP as well as those they are entitled to as ELLs. Our Special Education teachers deliver 
services in the form of Integrated Co-Teaching and Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS) and Integrated Co-
Teaching (ICT). ENL services come in the form of push-in and standalone instruction. Instructional strategies used in the 
content areas include purposeful grouping, additional resources, scaffolding and home language support.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
As noted, ELL-SWDs receive services in the form of Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) and/or Special Education Teacher Support 
Services (SETSS). In addition, ELL-SWDs receive support in the form of integrated and standalone ENL as determined by 
their proficiency level. Besides these specific classes, ELL-SWDs are in general education classrooms. As such, ELL-SWDs receive 
their mandated services while also benefiting from the least restrictive environment each day.

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Tutoring and additional support from the ENL teacher are made available throughout the year based on need. These services 
are available to all ELLs and are not subgroup-specific.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Reading ability appears to be at the root of the challenges our ELLs experience academically. This insight is reflected in the 
NYSESLAT scores and confirmed by teachers across subject areas. In response to this, ENL instruction is built around extended 
daily reading.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
English Language Learners are afforded equal access to all services and offerings in the school. The offerings for our ELLs 
include the following: 
 
The ENL Title III supplemental program for ELLs provides after-school support for English Language Learners.  
 
PM school classes meet from November 1, 2017 until March 28, 2017. Classes are offered on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 
3:00 pm until 5:00 pm.  
 
Saturday Regents Prep courses are offered on 10 Saturdays in December of 2017, as well as, January, May, and June of 2018. 
These courses are held from 9 am until 12 pm.  
 
The Learning to Work (LTW) program helps students with job readiness, career exploration, and academic support.  
The Liberty Partnership Program (LPP) offers services, such as academic support, to students at risk of dropping out.  
  
 
 
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
ELLs at Harlem Renaissance High School are provided access to resources including the following list. These resources are not 
specific to any ELL subgroup or content area. Rather, many of these resources may be used across content areas and for all ELL 
subgroups.

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Only ENL is offered at HRHS. Dictionaries are available in the languages of the majority of students. When feasible, students 
are encouraged to use online translation resources to help with content. The ENL teacher and content teachers provide home 
language support when applicable and appropriate. Students are often grouped and encouraged to use their home language 
when working with peers who have the same home language. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The services and resources are informed by the grade level demands of the content areas. Teachers ensure that resources and 
services are always grade appropriate. Services are also designed to be age-appropriate and culturally relevant to the students, 
which is achieved by carefully selecting and designing materials.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
The parent coordinator facilitates the orientation and admissions process and becomes the first contact person for students 
and families. The guidance counselor and the programmer work with students and evaluate transcripts to determine which 
classes students should be placed in. The ENL teacher meets new students as early as possible to ensure that they are 
comfortable in their classes.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

The only foreign language class offered currently is Spanish.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional Development at Harlem Renaissance High School focuses on ensuring that tasks foster metacognitive thinking. 
This work includes considering how to design task that are accessible to ELLs and set up ELLs to succeed. One specific goal of 
this work is to improve and increase the writing of all of our students, including ELLs.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The Peer-Collaborative Teacher at Harlem Renaissance conducts the weekly professional development meetings and works in 
conjunction with the ENL teacher to ensure that each meeting for professional development specifically considers the needs of 
ELLs. As such, all participating teachers will receive weekly professional development that considers the needs of ELLs. 
Attendance is taken during each meeting and an agenda is recorded. This information is collected in a cumulative folder. 
 
The ENL teacher attends sufficient professional development opportunities outside of Harlem Renaissance High School 
throughout the year to ensure that 50% of total Professional Development hours are ELL-specific. This includes, but is not 
limited to, the offerings promoted through the Division of English Language Learners and Student Support. The ENL teacher 
keeps agendas and proof of attendance in a cumulative folder. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL teacher holds individual parent meetings with parents/guardians over the course of the school year. These meetings 
are in addition to DOE-scheduled conferences. These meetings are held in person if possible or over the phone if preferred. 
Meeting times are varied to accommodate parents/guardians. The ENL teacher uses the phone interpreter service whenever it 
is necessary.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

The ENL teacher maintains ongoing correspondence with parents/guardians of ELLs to the extent that this is possible. 
Parents/guardians are notified of parent-teacher conferences through phone calls and letters sent to the home. These 
outreach efforts are conducted in the parent/guardian's preferred language whenever possible. During school events like 
parent-teacher conferences, bilingual staff members, as well as the over-the-phone translation services, are used to 
communicate in the parent/guardian's preferred language.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, James M. Caputo, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We determine the primary language spoken by each parent through home surveys, which are done for every 
student enrolled at Harlem Renaissance High School. Then we evaluate the results to determine translation 
needs. We also interview each family upon registration to determine language needs. Once that has taken place, 
we keep the collected information in files, which are at the principal's secretary office.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

4 Arabic  

35 Spanish  

1 French/Creole  

Please note that when 
need to communicate with 
some of those parents 
arises, often times they 
rely on the help of older 
children, cousins, or other 
relatives who are fluent in 
English and are available 
to help.  

a) all school personnel 
were informed of 
language needs during our
