Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission of I.S. 234 is to ensure that we successfully educate the whole child. All children are different and special. 

We stimulate their individuality by promoting the arts, music, drama, technology as well as rigorous academia 

ensuring that every child has an opportunity to shine. 

We pride ourselves on our nurturing & dynamic community. We ensure that all students are able to question and 
challenge themselves as well as the world around them. We are committed to providing our students with the tools 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

necessary to prepare them for college and career readiness. Our mission is to create lifelong learners; for that is the 

path of true success. 

The Home-School Partnership ensures the importance of parent involvement in each child’s education. Through this 
partnership, our school community will support the students by providing a rich learning environment and a home 

away from home where all students feel treasured and safe. 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Cunningham School of Science and Technology is a family-oriented, safe, and nurturing school whose students come 
from more than 30 different countries. In an effort to prepare our student body for college and career, we empower 
them to think critically and engage in rich peer-to-peer collaboration across all disciplines. Cunningham focuses on 
engineering, technology, math, sustainability, and environmental issues through hands-on STEAM-related activities., 
robotics, coding, Everfi, residencies, field trips, partnerships, and service-learning opportunities. Students will become 
communicators and collaborators while learning new and exciting engineering and technology skills, conducting 
research, applying math concepts, and striving to create a model for a sustainable community. The program heightens 
students' curiosity in STEAM by laying a solid foundation for futures in engineering and tech fields through all subject 
areas by teaching the critical skills that life and work demand. In September 2018, Cunningham is beginning a 
partnership with the Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI) to strengthen literacy across all disciplines.  

Cunningham is one of New York City's most culturally diverse schools with a population that is 24% Asian, 13% 
Hispanic, 18% Black, 43% White, and 2% multi-racial/Pacific Islander/American Indian. The school population consists 
of 1,866 students in grades 6-8. Throughout the school, classes are arranged by designations of Advanced, Honors, 
and Explorers. Within these designations, students with disabilities (SWDs) and English as a New Language students 
(ENLs) are integrated across the programs. The school offers Regents/high school credit-bearing courses in science, 
mathematics, U.S. history and foreign language proficiency.  

At Cunningham, we uphold rigorous academic standards and expectations for students in literacy, numeracy, 
technology, and social citizenship. We commit to the belief that all students can learn, grow, and succeed through 
effort, perseverance, and diligence. The familial atmosphere fosters a culture of sharing, and provides a safe, 
nurturing environment where students thrive and parents and teachers work collaboratively to create possibilities for 
them to excel. The school values the dignity and worth of each member of the school community, and involves 
parents, community, staff, and students in teaching and learning decisions. The school supports the academic, 
personal, and professional growth of each individual and inspires life-long learning among all. Our doors are always 
open to encourage and develop new ideas to meet the ever-changing needs of our students. 

 

Cunningham believes in fostering the growth of the 'whole child' and offers a variety of programs, partnerships, and 
courses as enrichment to engage a wide range of studies and interests. The school offers foreign language, traditional 
band, rock band, chorus, drama, and hosts a state-of-the-art dance studio. The school has partnerships with 
Millennium, Urban Advantage, and Project Citizen. For the students’ social and emotional growth, the school 
participates in anti-bullying programs, TCIS, and peer intervention programs.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Cunningham is a school community with an incredibly diverse range of students including English Language Learners 
(ELLs) and Students with Disabilities (SWDs). Our entering ENL students participate in a short-term welcome class and 
then transition into one of our programs to support them in acclimating to a new language and environment. Our ENL 
students require immersion into the English language and targeted instruction that address students' visual, auditory, 
and tactile-kinesthetic modalities. The instructional needs of our SWD population vary greatly from requiring separate 
small classes to ICT to general education with SETSS support. In addition to class placement needs, some SWDs 
require individualized reading support, and services such as speech/language, OT, PT, and counseling. Many of the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

specific needs of SWDs are met on an individualized basis. Instruction is also delivered to engage visual, auditory, and 
tactile-kinesthetic modalities. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The Cunningham community has made the most progress with our goal for rigorous instruction. Most of the student 
population has demonstrated growth in the use of data and details to articulate the development of ideas and/or 
rationale for problem-solving. This growth has been evident through student performance on the 2018 ELA MOSL, 
teacher observations, and the June 2018 periodic assessment for mathematics. Our teachers have worked in 
professional learning communities to share ideas for lesson planning, host inter-visitations, and engage in 
conversations about student performance to facilitate the growth in the use of data and details. Our school 
administration supported teachers through participating in planning meetings, modeling instructional practices, and 
engaging in Danielson-based conversations about teaching and learning.  

During the 2018-2019 school year, our key area of focus will be building a more supportive environment. Our entire 
school community recognizes the importance of supporting the development of our students in multiple ways 
including social-emotional learning, academic support, building equity for all learners, and empowering students 
through thoughtful feedback. During the 2017-2018, teachers increased their use of meaningful academic feedback to 
support academic performance. The entire faculty will continue to use feedback as a tool for impacting academic 
performance and refine their methods for building a more supportive environment. In addition, supervisors, teachers, 
intervention support teachers (formerly deans), guidance counselors, and teaching assistants are in the process of 
being trained in various social-emotional programs (i.e. TCIS) to support students in their personal growth.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Our beautifully diverse school community is comprised of approximately 10% ELLs. Based on an ongoing analysis of 
ENL student performance, our explicit instruction of academic vocabulary needs to be addressed. Every member of 
our faculty works with our ENL students because they are integrated across our programs. By addressing the 
instruction of academically vocabulary for ELLs, we are also impacting language acquisition of our non-ELLs in all 
classrooms in all subjects across our entire school. Our school is engaged in a partnership with the Continuous 
Learning Program (CLP) which supports ELLs through the practice of improvement science driven by evidence-based 
methodologies. During our CLP process this year, we used a tracking system called 2017-2018 Plan-Do-Study-Act 
(PDSA) to monitor our efforts with ELLs in the area of academic vocabulary acquisition. The data from this study 
yielded that approximately 50% of ENL students demonstrated growth with this skill. Using the information from this 
in-depth study of ELLs has led us to frame our rigorous instruction goal around this need. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 65% of grade 6 ENL students will demonstrate progress in reading comprehension as evidenced by the 
levels of growth between the September 2018 and May 2019 Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) assessment.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
The school will use the ELA MOSL and DRP (for grade 6) assessments to monitor progress that specifically target the 
standards for vocabulary acquisition. These assessments will provide a baseline, mid-year interim and end of year 
benchmarks. The benchmark assessments will be administered in October 2018, January 2019, and May 2019. By 
January 2019, 50% of students will demonstrate 5% progress in the related standards. Additionally, the PDSA system 
will be used throughout the year to monitor progress monthly. Teacher teams will evaluate progress by analyzing 
data from the various assessments to target and refine their instruction. Administration and Teacher Leaders will 
work together to coordinate specific professional development throughout the school year.  

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
Assessments in ELA will be administered in late September 2018, January 2019, and May 2019. The fall-winter DRP 
cycle will be used to measure interim progress.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
In our effort to prepare all learners for college and career, students require social-emotional support along with 
constructive and consistent feedback from faculty members that enable them to set and achieve academic goals. This 
holistic approach to supporting the 'whole child' provides students with valuable information concerning how they 
can both improve their academic performance and manage the dynamics of their changing lives.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 90% of grade 7 students will use teacher feedback and social-emotional support techniques (i.e. TCIS, 
College Access for All) to increase achievement in all subject areas as evidence by overall performance in Pupil 
Path.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
Engaging in a holistic approach to supporting the 'whole child' involves active partnerships with families. Teachers and 
administrators will use the time provisioned for parents throughout the year to share the programs and techniques 
used by trained faculty with students. During our first open school evening in September, parents will be given an 
overview of our social-emotional program by our 'intervention support teachers' and guidance counselors.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The Cunningham community is home to an incredibly diverse range of students. Among our community, we have 
some students in which English is a new language and others students who are increasing their proficiency in English. 
Because we serve a significant population of ELLs and F-ELLs, administrators, teachers, and teaching assistants need to 
refine their instructional approaches to meet the needs of these learners. Our preliminary 2018 NYS ELA exam results 
reveal that our ELL population has the potential to make a great amount of growth during the next school year. In 
order to support the progress of our ELLs, it is essential that the curricula across grades and subjects are connected on 
multiple levels, especially regarding the acquisition of academic vocabulary.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 90% of teachers during common planning time will embed interdisciplinary connections and concise 
learning objectives into lessons to support the acquisition of academic vocabulary for all learners.

The connections between our school, the families of our students, and our community play an integral role in 
impacting students academically, emotionally and socially. One of Cunningham's most important pillars is building 
relationships with families to positively affect the lives of students. Cunningham uses a variety of technology-based 
programs and in-person parent workshops to engage with families regularly. During the 2018-2019 school year, we 
will take additional steps to strengthen family and community ties through the lens of language acquisition. Our 
literacy programs, interdisciplinary 'power words,' and instructional methodologies will be shared both digitally and in 
person with families through monthly workshops. These steps will empower families to foster literacy at home.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
The faculty at Cunningham is teaching in their certified areas. Many of our teachers hold dual certification. All 
teachers must teacher under the license that matches their assignment. Our faculty works closely in Professional 
Learning Communities to create a professional atmosphere of support and collegiality. Every teacher will have a 
common planning period built into their schedules to facilitate interdisciplinary planning and communication 
horizontally and vertically. Teachers will participate in inter-visitations to foster a sense of trust and openness. Faculty 
members are invited to participate in off-site professional development that addresses the 'whole child' ranging from 
TCIS to Continuous Learning to programs hosted by the New York Historical Society. Administrators work closely with 
teacher teams and offer support through coaching, hosting model lessons, and facilitating professional development 
framed around evidence-based instructional practice.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Our high quality professional development will be centered upon the use of quantitative and qualitative data to tailor 
instruction for all learners. On-site and off-site professional development sessions will be offered to the faculty to 
enhance formative assessment techniques and to use the data generated by these methods to set CCSS-aligned 
learning targets for every student. Our Continuous Learning coaches are in the process of training teachers in the 
practice of improvement science to conduct an inquiry about student learning and to use this knowledge to support 
students in every classroom. Our PLCs and common planning teams will meet several times a week in multiple 
configurations to ensure vertical and horizontal continuity within and across each subject area. Facilitating the 
collaboration of all staff members ensures that CCSS lessons are delivered across the school. Many of our staff 
members have an expertise in an area of the curricula and instructional practice. These staff members will present 
workshops and host visitations in their classrooms as part of professional learning cycles. Currently, we have a team 
of core subject teachers revising curriculum maps to ensure that alignment to the CCSS and connections between 
disciplines are at the forefront of every lesson plan. The curricula provided to teachers are endorsed by the NYSED 
(Code X, Passport, Big Ideas) and student work is examined by teams to shape instruction and scaffolds for all 
students. This 'learning through doing' approach to professional development increases professional engagement and 
ensures authenticity of our progress.

Part 3: TA Schools Only 

3a. Use of Program Resources 

Describe how the TA program resources will assist participating children to meet proficiency. 
The TA program resources will assist participating children in meeting proficiency across all subjects in a myriad of 
ways. The resources will be used to reduce class size, to train teachers through on-site and off-site professional 
development in the latest evidence-based instructional practices, to facilitate blocks of time for teachers to co-plan to 
meet the diverse needs of the targeted children, to order individualized subscriptions to MindPlay for targeted 
children, to offer Saturday Academy and after school AIS programs, and to order high-interest texts, materials, and 
technological devices for participating children. in addition to academic supports, TA program resources will support 
the social-emotional growth of targeted students by providing the services of guidance counselors, intervention 
support teachers, and teachers trained in TCIS.  

 

 
3b. TA Coordination with the Regular Program 

Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e., 
providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from 
the regular classroom during regular school day). 
The TA program and the regular education program will ensure that rigorous, high-quality, CCSS aligned curricula is 
seamlessly delivered to all students. Our teacher teams will use multiple forms of ongoing data to provide scaffolds 
and set learning targets for each student. The various types of support (access to targeted programs like MindPlay, 
small group instruction, high-interest texts, content-specific materials) for TA students will be embedded into the 
every teacher's daily planning. Teachers and teaching assistants will work in teams to connect TA program supports 
into the regular educational program to ensure that every targeted student receives access to resources to foster 
achievement.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met.

2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Arthur W. Cunningham School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

W.A. Cunningham will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

Begin description here:            
Our ENL supplemental programs will include a program embedded into the school day by 
Elevated Education and a Saturday Academy. 
Elevate Education will be working with our classes that serve both our ENL and SWD student 
populations. Elevate provides support for students will study skills, test taking skills, and close 
reading strategies through their trained personnel alongside our teachers. The Elevate facilitators 
are specially trained to tailor their presentations for ENLs and SWDs. Our of our missions at 
Cunningham is to support the progress of students who are classified as ENL and SWD. 
The major part of our Supplemental Program is the use of content teachers to provide 
additional  instructional support to approximately 100 students in grade 6,7 and 8,  in Humanities 
and Math. This will be provided through a Saturday Academy program. 
Our Saturday Academy will run for approximately 10 weeks beginning in December and ending 
in April,  targeting transitioning, expanding and long term ELLs. They will meet on 
Saturdays  for three hours, starting at 8:30 a.m. and ending at 11:30 a.m. These groups are 
targeted to provide enrichment support and opportunities that will lead to greater academic 
achievements in the content areas.  Over the last two years we were able to provide additional 
instruction, during the school day, in the content areas through literacy, which resulted in high 
levels of student progress.  Hence the reason to target this population. 
Four content/subject teachers will be involved in this program and one ENL teacher.  The ENL 
teacher will rotate co-teaching with the Humanities and Math teachers. 
Teachers will create units of study based on student needs and specific needs outlined by content 
area teachers. During weekly common planning sessions worked into our teachers' programs, the 
subject/content teachers will collaborate with the ENL certified specialists to look at student 
work, evaluate students' needs, and plan for instruction. 
Two content/subject teachers will co-teach with a licensed ENL teacher and work with students 
through direct instruction. 
**Students will be instructed in English with native language support in the form of written 
texts, dictionaries, glossaries, computer and web based forums. 
**Content area texts will be used during these sessions, augmented by other materials available 
to support instruction of  each unit of study or group of lessons.  Audio reading materials will be 
utilized to provide added support to students as they master new literacy and numeracy skills.

All staff involved with the direct instruction of ENLs and F-ENLs will continue to receive 
professional development turnkeyed by members of the Continuous Learning Team and by 
members of the ENL team during common planning time and during workshops on Mondays in 
instructional strategies for our ELLs. This professional learning will support teachers in their use 
of data from the RLAT along with current, formative measures to address the various modalities 
of students as means of fostering the acquisition of a new language. To refresh their training and 
to further develop new instructional strategies during this school year, the Assistant Principal 
Ms. Wachtel and the ENL teachers Mr. Mena, Ms. Perez, Mr. Kalfas, and Ms. Keiper will 
continue to attend workshops and  study groups implemented/presented by the BFSC and the 
Office of ELLs.  Our ENL/SWD coordinator, Ms. Barquinero, will support the ELL team 
through modeling instruction, training general education teachers in ENL methodologies, and 
leading analysis of ELL assessment data. In addition, a team of teachers is involved in the 
Continuous Learning Program (noted above) which uses the practice of improve science to study 
ELL performance and implement evidence-based strategies to support ELL achievement. The 
information will be turn keyed to other staff members who instruct ELLs. Whenever possible 
content area teachers will also attend these workshops specifically related to their area of 
expertise.  
In addition, Elevate Education will be presenting professional development for the entire staff 
concerning how to support ENLs with close reading and study skills. This PD will be aligned 
with the workshops series offered to students through Elevate. 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

Begin description here:            
Parent involvement is a major part of students' success. Many of the parents of our ELLs are new 
to the country but some have lived in the US for many years.  However many of them are not 
familiar with the elementary and secondary schools in the US and how they operate.  It is 
difficult for them to navigate our school system and to find the benefits that can be afforded 
to/benefit their children. Therefore they need guidance as they go through the process.  Our 
school will provide workshops and/activities that will be helpful to parents: 
"High School Information Night" which is open to all students in our school will be enhanced to 
meet the needs of ELLs' parent population.  Interpretation will be made available to parents as 
they speak to school representatives visiting our school.  This evening runs for three hours and 
is facilitated by our Guidance Counselor and Assistant Principal with participation by 
neighborhood, borough-wide and citywide high schools. 
Elevate Education will be presenting a workshop series for parents about supporting reading and 
studying at home. These workshops will be run during evenings in conjunction with the PA and 
our Parent Coordinator, Ms. Guttenplan. Schedule is TBD. 
Parents consistently ask for adult English classes.  In the past we have provided these classes for 
them during our Saturday Academy.  We plan to run workshops for parents during our Saturday 
Academy. Language accuracy and fluency will help them navigate their new life in America and 
also to support the needs of their children.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At our level, Middle School, most of our students have already acquired early literacy skills, and the IEPs of the SWDs indicate 
their literacy level. Teachers use iReady diagnostics or Fontas and Pinnell to help identify students’ current reading levels. The 
school and teachers also use the LAB-R, NYSESLAT, ELA, Math,  Formal and Informal reading records to analyze the students’ 
progress and needs. The reading levels help teachers to determine students’ instructional level, assist students in choosing 
independent reading materials, and help to set standards and create goals for students' instructional focus. Teachers also use 
school wide benchmark  assessment to further their knowledge of student levels. The results of the data provide information 
about students' strengths and weaknesses. The teachers utilize the data to drive instruction, in planning guided teaching 
groups and to individualize instructions.   This data helps the school in scheduling students to receive support and intervention 
services as required by individual needs. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

At the school wide level teachers meet in various cohorts to look at and analyze data and student work. Teachers use the data 
during common planning, grade level content planning and creation/modification of units of study.  Throughout the school all 
instructional planning is mandated to reflect accommodations for ELLs. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Programs for ELL's are evaluated based on the results of the NYSESLAT and State tests scores.  This year iReady baseline 
assessment is also being used to provide baseline assessment in ELA and Math are being used to provide more specific skills 
information and data on each student. Additionally, the following is a list of approaches that are used as guides for ensuring 
growth in our students learning:  ELL , Portfolios, Formative/Summative Assessments, Annual Yearly Performance 
Report/Progress Reports.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the data is gathered, students are placed in programs during the day and after school to provide the needed 
interventions.  iReady intervention program is used for in class instruction and for home practice in ELA and Math. Additionally 
students are provided opportunities for small group instruction in after school and Saturday programs. The data is also shared 
with content teachers for planning and instructional purposes as they design lessons to meet student needs. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Not Applicable.  6-8  School. 
  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
An analysis of the NYSESLAT indicate that about 15% of the students tested at the commanding level;  about 35% tested at the 
expanding  level;  29% tested at the transitioning level; about 9% tested at the emerging level and about 10% at the entering 
level.   The highest percent scored at the expanding level in grades 6 and 8. For the 7th grade scores were highest at the 
transitioning level.  NYSITELL scores generally mirror the NYSESLAT scores recorded for our ENL population. 
  
An analysis of the NYSESLAT modalities indicate that students perform better in the areas of listening and speaking, and 
require more scaffolding for reading and writing. The same is evident on the NYSITELL.  One particular area that stands out 
about our ELLs,  that we learned from our periodic assessments,  students show higher level of deficiency in vocabulary, with 
particular attention to figurative language and academic usage of words.  The ENL specialists and the content area teachers 
will continue to look at student work to determine areas of weakness and target instruction to meet student needs. Teachers 
will focus on word work to help in improving  outcomes for students. 
  
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

This information is shared with the staff at faculty meeting at the beginning of the school year.  Teachers are also given the 
information as it related to their teaching population. Administrators received this information as they articulate with guidance 
counselors and deans to procure class placements for all students. Classes are set up in May/June and students are 
programmed based on predictive assessments and students historical performance. Students are programmed in classes to get 
the mandated time allocation for instruction in ENL and content supports.  In early September adjustments are made as 
needed for servicing all time mandates for students.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our school delivers instruction in block programming for entering and emerging students in a stand-alone ENL 
program and integrated ENL. Our  grade 7 students in this group are serviced by a teacher dually licensed in ELA and 
ENL.  Our 6th and 8  th  grade groups are serviced by an ENL teacher and Licensed ELA teacher in a co-teaching model. 
On all three levels, the students travel together as a graded group i.e. 6th, 7th and 8th grade. In addition, we have an 
ENL teacher will instruct a short-term welcome class to support entering and emerging students with their transition 
in our Advanced, Honors, and Explorers programs. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not applicable. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Not Applicable. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

All ENL students receive the mandated minutes of instruction in ENL in alignment with CR Part 154.  Entering and Emerging 
receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction and 180 minutes of ENL/ELA for a total of 360 minutes, which are divided into double 
and single periods. Students are homogeneously grouped.  Transitioning and Expanding receive 90 minutes of  ENL and 90 
minutes ENL/Content area  instruction weekly.  This is facilitated by daily single period of  push-in/co-teaching instruction. 
Commanding students receive 90 minutes INTEGRATED ENL in ELA or other Content Areas. 
 
All ENL student instruction is provided by licensed ENL teachers, and/ or licensed content specialists.   
ELA instruction aligned to The Common Core Learning Standards is provided by licensed ELA teachers. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The core content is delivered to ENL students through the push in/co-teaching model.  Students use Common Core 
instructional materials that are modified for understanding complex ideas.  Content area instruction is delivered to ENL 
students through a collaborative approach.  ENL students are grouped by proficiency levels. Entering and Emerging students 
are grouped together. Each of the other level  students are also grouped together. 
  
The school utilizes the “push in” model of ESL instruction. Instruction is standards based and aligned to the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  Curriculum maps have been created across the grades/content so that all out of classroom providers can 
service students consistently. The ESL teacher supports the content teachers and collaboratively, they conduct lessons. The 
teachers make content comprehensible to enrich language development by implementing scaffolds and supports. All content 
curriculum in the school have ENL accommodations  built in. 
  
Teachers use Common Core aligned Code-X  program to support the ELA curriculum. Standards-based activities include a 
variety of genres to enhance and promote student interest.  Reading and writing are heavily embedded in classroom activities 
that are linked to reading selections, and are tailored to meet the reading and writing standards. Native language support is 
provided as necessary through the use of the computer/Ipads, Google translate, glossaries and dictionaries in different 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

languages.   
  
Our Stand alone Entering and Emerging students use the Code X program with supplements from the Inside curriculum which 
is Common Core aligned. 
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

ELLs are evaluated in their native language only when Spanish Speaking students take the Spanish LAB to determine language 
dominance, since there is no bilingual or dual language programs in our school.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

SIFE students and Students at risk are provided with AIS which includes one-to-one tutoring and small group instruction during 
after school intervention classes. Those students are also assigned to their regular ENL and English classes.   
  
b.  Newcomers are a challenge at the middle school level since they are at a point of trying to master communicative English 
and at the same time learning the content that will keep them on track as they prepare for High School.  To help them 
overcome this challenge, teachers infuse the ENL classes with content strategies while at the same time providing multiple 
entry points and scaffolds for mastering content.  Tutoring after school on Tuesdays and Wednesdays provide additional 
support for students.  These programs are designed to improve students’ Reading, Writing, Math, Science and Social Studies 
skills.  Students participate in two instructional program models: self contained and push-in.   Our newly arrived students are 
serviced in a self contained, heterogeneously grouped classes according to grade level. 
  
c.  The goal for ENL students receiving services for 4-6 years is to avoid them becoming long term ELL's.  These students are 
flagged  immediately for targeted intervention.  Their tests scores in ELA and NYSESLAT are analyzed for possible trends 
leading to remediation.  The school’s curricula in all content areas are standards based as mandated by NYSED and 
NYDOE.  Other than those ENL students who are newly arrived, all students participate in the same curricula as non-ENL 
students.  Title lll after school programs and Saturday Academy are provided for and open to all ENL students.  SIFE students 
and Students At Risk are provided with AIS which includes  iReady Math and ELA, REWARDS, one-to-one tutoring and small 
group instruction.  ENL students participate in programs designed to improve their performance on NYSESLAT, ELA and Math, 
and help them to achieve proficiency in a timely manner. 
  
d.   Long term ELL's are targeted by all teachers as being students at risk.  Instructions will be targeted to meet individual 
learning challenges of these students.  They are also invited to participate in after school AIS and supplemental programs 
offered after school. 
  
e.    Transitional support for ENL students reaching proficiency on the NYSESLAT includes immersion in general education 
classrooms with additional scaffolding by general education teachers trained with ENL methodologies, and ENL teachers. 
Students also receive 90 minutes of instructional/academic support from licensed ENL teacher weekly. Instructional programs 
are offered after school for F-ENL students  in ELA and Math through The Common Core Success Academy held 2 hours per 
week. Transitional support for F-ENLs also includes testing accommodations on state exams, continued use of bilingual 
glossaries  Former ENLs are invited to AIS programs after school to prepare for state exams.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
To provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development, teachers use various ESL strategies 
which include scaffolding, use of graphic organizers, visuals, glossaries,  and laptops for reading and writing. All this is in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

addition to the traditional strategies used for ELLs and Special Education students. To meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs 
within the least restrictive environment, our school uses The Common Core Learning Standards based curricular for 
instruction. Teachers and students follow a pacing calendar designed to meet the needs of our school and our students for 
timely delivery of instruction and content. Students are grouped heterogeneously or homogeneously as is needed to meet 
their needs. Students are all instructed using grade appropriate materials with scaffolding, modified and differentiated to 
enable maximum manageability for all students within the least restrictive environment. Content rich texts are available to all 
ENL-SWDs that has readability and comprehension at their level. 
Our Social Studies and Science texts also provide additional activities and support materials that differentiate for our ENLs and 
Special needs students.  Our school does not have a bilingual program nor SWDs who require a bilingual program.    They also 
spend time with non-disabled peers in minor subjects, physical education and the arts. 
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
A concerted effort is made to prepare ENL-SWDs for success in the least restrictive environment.  Instructional material include 
Inside and i-Ready.  Content area teachers are provided with some content materials which supports all student learning by 
providing rigorous curriculum as is mandated by CCLS.  Classes are scheduled to go into the computer lab or have laptops 
brought to the classroom for accessing online content in Study Island and i-Ready.  Accommodations are made by teachers 
to  ensure maximum benefit of the instructional time in the classroom.  
Our ELLs with special needs (depending on their IEPs) are assigned paraprofessionals or placed in appropriate self-contained 
(12:1:1) or ICT settings, which allow these students to learn at an appropriate level and pace. These paraprofessionals assist 
teachers in providing individualized instruction, while helping students to make progress at their own pace and with the 
necessary language supports.  SWDs receive all the necessary services and accommodations dictated by their IEPs.  The ENL 
teacher,  content specialist and special education teachers work collaboratively to provide instruction in the least restrictive 
environment. Team teaching is carefully integrated in order to provide accurate and necessary services to ensure that students 
meet IEP goals. 
In addition, the use of smaller classes with adapted content materials in a blended model has also been successfully 
implemented. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All intervention programs are offered in English at our school and will be provided during, after school and on Saturdays.  The 
targeted groups are students scoring 2.4 to 2.9 in ELA and Math state tests, students scoring below 2.4, entering and emerging 
ENLs and SWDs. 
  
During the day targeted students will receive academic vocabulary support through small group tutoring by content specialists 
and intervention support teachers. 
Students will receive targeted intervention in Math, in our after school academy through targeted, skill based, direct 
instruction that is supported by technology.  Social Studies and Science will be supported through  literacy instruction, using 
content based reading resources.   These interventions will be provided after school and on Saturdays. 
  
Native Language materials are provided to all classroom teachers and for students through content glossaries, use of IPads and 
Goggle Translate.  
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Staff has been trained in the Rewards  and Wilson programs which have been proved  to benefit ENL population with word 
work fluency and comprehension.   This program will be used with self contained ENL students this year, and with some of our 
expanding and transitioning students to support the lack of vocabulary attack skills. 
We will also use Finish Line for one of our AIS programs this year.

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Not applicable. 
 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 School wide enrichment classes and after school clubs and activities are open to all ENL students before, during and after 
school. These enrichment opportunities include:  chess, debate and public speaking, Model UN, dance, yearbook, 
journalism/newspaper, jazz band, drama, basketball, soccer, creative arts, community service, 3-D Sculpture, Mouse Squad, 
and flag football 
  
ENL students are afforded equal access to all school programs. They are encouraged to attend tutoring, enrichment, athletic 
and general school activities. Notifications are distributed in English and in students' native language.   
  
Scaffolding for students is provided through small group instruction and one-to-one tutoring, MindPlay,  iReady Math and 
iReady ELA. Additionally, students participate in  Interim Assessments, quarterlies, and ELL assessments which will be 
monitored and adjusted on a regular basis.   
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All ENL students are support by MyOn Reader, MindPlay, Study Island, Brainpop, and iReady Math and ELA which are all online 
programs in the content areas. These program usage is encouraged for all students.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In the Freestanding ENL program, students have access to bilingual dictionaries and bilingual glossaries, translated texts, 
bilingual audio/visual materials.  They can also partner with other native speakers of same language in the classroom as  peer 
translators. The classroom and school libraries also have several informational and literature text  books in most of the 
languages within the school. Native language support is provided across all content area classes.  Students have access to 
iPads that support the use of native language and new language acquisition through Google Translate. Students are provided 
with dictionaries and glossaries at the beginning of they year and allowed to use them on all exams at the local and state 
levels, and on all assignments. 
Students are given the opportunity to take state tests that are available in their home language. 
  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Services are provided at students' grade level.  Students are programmed this year by grade level cohorts, as opposed to 
bridged .  Therefore all students this year are in grade appropriate classes, with one self contained class on each grade 
level.  All ENL teachers deliver instruction to ENL students in English.  Teachers choose content concepts that are age 
appropriate and matched to the educational background level of the students. Teachers use supplementary materials such as 
graphs, models/manipulatives and visual aids, to ensure that content areas are taught at the levels of student proficiency.  
Teachers introduce meaningful activities that incorporate concepts providing opportunities for listening, speaking, reading and 
writing. Teachers identify various ways to assess our students’ progress using data from, NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, ELL Periodic, 
IReady Math and ELA. 
Assessments, NYS ELA, NYS Math,  Formative assessments to identify students’ preferred learning styles, strengths and 
weaknesses and individual learning needs 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Not applicable. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 All students are given instructions regarding procedures for the first day of school.  Students and parents of ENL students 
know which class they have been assigned before the first day.  Guidance Counselors are available prior to the first day of 
school for familiarizing students with opening day procedures.  Cunningham places newly-arrived students in self-contained 
classes in which they are immersed in English.  Students are provided “buddy” students to familiarize them with the school and 
routines.  Scaffolding for students is provided through small group instruction and one-to-one tutoring. Sixth graders are 
invited a week before school re-opens to meet their attendance and content teachers and classmates.  They also get a tour of 
the building.  During the school year the same services are afforded to newly enrolled ELLs.  The parent coordinator meets 
with the families to tour the building and the guidance counselors' along with translators and ENL pedagogue do initial 
interviews and welcoming of students and their families. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

As with all our students, our ENL students  in 7th and 8th grades are instructed in Spanish as another language.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Not applicable.   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
1. Teachers of ENL students regularly attend literacy and math professional development sessions in which modifications and 
adaptations for language acquisition and reinforcement are addressed.  New curricula in social studies and science have “built 
in” ELL support.  Workshops for “looking at student work” of ENL enables teachers to constantly realign instruction according 
to student needs.  Analyses of performance on NYSESLAT take place in ENL workshops.  Our five TESOL professionals have 
received training from WestEd Quality Teaching organization, and have participated in a series of professional development 
workshops specifically targeting the ENL population. When available, all staff are encouraged to attend workshops offered by 
OIT, WestEd, QTEL, CITE, NCTE, and other providers.  Strategies and activities for differentiation and academic language 
development include: 
* Developing an understanding of changing ENL issues, strategies and methodologies 
*Training on scaffolding of instruction for ENL students is given, to incorporate ENL strategies in all content areas. 
*Emphasis on the development of teaching competencies/strategies  in the instruction of academic vocabulary acquisition and 
writing skills  
Teachers will continue to collaborate in developing and using units of study in the content that addresses the needs of all 
students, especially ENL learners.  Teachers will receive training and continued support throughout the school year as they 
continue to introduce and refine the use of the National Geographic Literacy program "Inside" which is Common Core aligned. 
2. A team of teachers who work with ENL students are members of the Continuous Learning Program. This team trains with 
specialized ENL coaches in the practice of improvement science to study ELL achievement in the area of language acquisition. 
This team attends outside and in-house PD sessions to study ELL performance and shape instruction around the evidence 
presented by students.

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Parents of ENL students are faced with cultural and language barriers.  Therefore, many parents do not have the accurate or 
complete information available to them to navigate the High School application.   Homeroom teachers, guidance counselors 
and other staff members provide language and translation support to parents during the HS application process. Teachers are 
provided with translators for conferences with parents during the high school application process.  Teachers are given time to 
meet with parents throughout the process whenever they are needed. 
  
The 15%  hours of training for all staff and 50%  hours for ENL teacher will be fulfilled as follows: 
The ESL AP and ENL teacher will work with the other instructional AP's to identify appropriate workshops for teachers to meet 
the requires hours and students instructional needs. 
  
All staff will be encouraged to attend workshops offered in-house and off site. These workshop content will be shared with 
other staff members. 
The ENL staff will model activities for mainstream personnel during professional periods and grade conferences to ensure that 
our ENL population receive differentiated ENL services throughout the day. 
ENL staff has also taken  part in additional QTEL/ENL workshops which have provided us with new and different 
ideas for our ENL student population. 
The AP responsible for ELLs  keep a record of all meetings and trainings attended by staff members.  Agenda  and attendance 
sheets will be kept on file by the AP.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parents are invited by letter, phone calls and emails to parent information sessions.  These sessions are held beginning in the 
month of September.  Parents are invited to come up to school during the Tuesday parent engagement time.   If parents 
cannot make it up to school, phone conferences are conducted with translation, if necessary.  Information is shared by the ENL 
teachers and sometimes content teachers. Translation support is provided by school personnel as needed and is available, or 
the translation service desk is utilized. 
  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

1. Parent involvement is a high priority at Cunningham.  We have an open door policy which allows parents to communicate 
with teachers whenever there is a need to address social, emotional or academic needs.  Parents are continuously encouraged 
to become actively involved in our school by joining the Parent Association (PA). Cunningham has a very vibrant and active 
Parent Association in which many parents of ENL's are involved. Parents also participate on the SLT and are vocal participants 
in the decision making process. They also participate in trips planned for families and for students. 
  
Cultural events, literacy, math skills, and test taking strategies workshops are hosted every year for parents.  At least 96% of 
parents come to parent teacher conference twice per year.  Parents also attend ENL classes for adults during our Saturday 
Academy. Parents of ENL's are faced with cultural and language barriers.  Therefore many parents do not have the accurate or 
complete information to navigate the High School application.  Our school hosts a HS night and the families are encouraged to 
participate.   On that night, translators are available for parents needing the service.  Visiting high schools  share information 
and answer parents' questions about the high schools, programs and the process.  Teachers, guidance counselors and other

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Tami Flynn, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At W. Arthur Cunningham I.S.234, we strive to eliminate communication blocks between the parents and our 
school by using translators on staff in a variety of languages. At the time of registration parents/guardians are 
mandated to fill out an emergency card. The card contains a space for the parents to fill in their preferred 
language of communication; both verbal and written. Parents/guardians also fill out a Home Language Survey 
(which they receive in their home language) where they are asked to identify the language in which they prefer to 
receive any written or oral communications and information. This information is then entered into the school’s 
ATS and updated as needed. Interviews are also held with students and parents who speak a language other than 
English at home. These interviews are conducted by the ENL teachers and other staff members who are fluent in 
languages other than English to identify communication translation needs for parents.

2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Staff will be given a copy of the regulation during the first week of the school year. They would also be made aware of 
the resources through the staff handbook and live during staff meetings. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

In an effort to implement Section VII of Chancellor's Regulations A-663 regarding parental notification for translation 
and interpretation services, the staff of IS 234 conducted a needs assessments via personal interview with parents and 
students to determine where a shortage of translated materials might exist for parents. At this time the following 
interventions are in place: 

A. Currently bilingual staff in the primary languages (Russian, Urdu, Bengali, Arabic, Italian, Punjabi, 

Chinese, Haitian Creole, and Spanish) are available on-site throughout the day to assist in communicating with the 
families of our students.  

B. Documents leaving the building are either translated or contain a message that is translated into seven languages, 
directing parents to contact the school regarding the notices they receive for the purpose of being informed of the 
contents of each notice.  

C. Currently, a sign is prominently posted outside the main entrance/lobby and in the main office 

indicating the availability of interpretation services. Smaller versions of the same signs are available at the security 
desk in the main lobby and at the reception desk in the main office for staff member to use while interviewing or 
checking parents into the building. 

C. The school will draw upon the services of the Department of Education's Translation and Interpretation Unit to 
expand the number of school documents that currently exist.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?

A short written survey will be made available to parents who use translation services at school, to indicate their level 
of satisfaction. This survey will be turned in at the main office. From the feed back the team will decide what needs to 
be modified or implemented. Historically our parents have been satisfied with the services received.
