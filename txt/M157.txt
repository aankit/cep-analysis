Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 UASGC Mission Statement 

By working closely with public and private partners, UASGC will provide 
opportunities for economic mobility through access to college and career 
pathways in the growing field of supply chain management and freight logistics, 
the backbone of global commerce. We educate students not just “for the 
occupation,” but “through the occupation,” integrating instruction of industry 
knowledge and skills throughout rigorous academic curricula. Through our 
extensive public and private partnerships, we create opportunities for students 
to participate in a growing and dynamic industry and ensure authentic student 
choice in post-secondary decisions, while providing significant social and 
emotional supports to ensure student success.  
  

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

We are supported by many partnerships, both within our industry and within the community. These partnerships 
operate in service to our students and our school and are critical in providing opportunities for our students. Our 
industry partners include the New York City Economic Development Corporation, CISCO, UPS, the Port Authority of 
New York and New Jersey, the NYC Department of Transportation, CSX Freight, the Metropolitan Transportation 
Council, Arizona State University’s W.P. Carey School of Business, Maritime College (SUNY), Rutgers University School 
of Business, the Apollo Theatre and many others in the industry and community. Through our partners, we provide 
students with significant work-based learning experiences, including mentoring, worksite visits, job shadowing and 
paid internships.  

 

UASGC is a community strongly grounded within its Core Values of Collaboration, Diligence and Respect. We embed 
these values into our daily instructional practice, professional work and into our community building. We have regular 
Town Halls with our students where we discuss and build a shared understanding of these values. We also have a 
strong Advisory Program to provide students with a space for community building and accountability for high 
expectations that we set for them. 

 

Additionally, we believe strongly in the importance of external fundraising to support enrichment programming at 
UASGC. Through the support of our Young Professionals Board, we have conducted significant fundraising to fund our 
growing arts programming and after school robotics courses. We believe that enrichment is a critical part of a 
students’ development at UASGC and that external fundraising is central to ensuring access to opportunities beyond 
what NYCDOE schools would typically be able to provide to their students. 

 

In the 2017 - 2018 school year, we deepened our instructional work placing an emphasis on developing rigorous 
college-ready and career oriented instructional objectives and tasks. We continue to believe that a student’s reading, 
writing and speaking abilities are central to his or her academic success.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

We are continuing to move towards a vision for instruction, which pushes students to the center of the learning, 
making teachers facilitators and empowering students to take ownership over their learning. We will also continue to 
further our work around Restorative Practices to continue to improve school culture and collective accountability for 
individual success. 

 

Collaboration is one of the Core Values of UASGC and is something that we live each day. This value is visible each day 
as our teacher teams work together to build a a shared vision for high quality instruction. We focused intensively on 
building our teacher teams this year. Teachers have spent significant amounts of time examining student work, 
reflecting on their practice, researching new instructional techniques and revising their curriculum and instruction as 
a result. This impact is being felt in the classrooms as we see an improvement in the academic performance of many 
of our most struggling students. This work will continue into next year, with the further development of teacher-
leaders to take on more of the instructional visioning next year. Through the work of teacher-leaders, the principal 
and the assistant principal, teacher teams will focus more intensively on revising curriculum, instruction and 
assessments to further their positive impact on student learning and student achievement. 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The Urban Assembly School for Global Commerce is a Career and Technical Education school that was founded in 
2013. The 2016-2017 school year was our first year at full capacity, with students in 9 th through 12 th grades, totaling 
250 students. This year we have 255 students in grades 9-12. 

 

Our student body is comprised of students from all city Boroughs, with the exception of Staten Island. We are the 
country’s first high school entirely dedicated to preparing students for careers in the industry of supply chain 
management and freight logistics, a growing and dynamic industry.  

 

There are currently 63 students with disabilities attending The Urban Assembly School for Global Commerce, 
compromising 27% of our total student population. Forty-0ne of the 63 students are in the 9th and 10th grade and 
have below reading grade levels. We have seen positive results from our integrated Co-teaching approaches as well as 
from the Special Education Teacher Support Services, Speech and Language Therapy and Counseling. This year we will 
focus on a Three -Tiered Literacy plan that includes Rewards, Grade Level literacy strategies and push in services.  

 

UA Global Commerce services 24 English Language Learners (ELLs) of diverse backgrounds and English levels, 
approximately 5 students are new to the country within the last year. Their home languages include Spanish, French, 
Arabic, Fulani, Mandingo, and Bambara. This year, ELL services will focus on both the granular levels of language use 
such as pronunciation, morphology, and vocabulary, while also developing more global skills such as reading rigorous 
texts with purpose and incorporating analysis into writing and discussion. Students will be encouraged to celebrate 
and explore their cultures and languages in the classroom, and will be provided with culturally relevant texts and 
materials. All ELLs and Students with IEPs are In co-taught classrooms, receiving specialized supports from specialized 
ELL teachers and Special Educators, depending on their specific needs. Students have access to a variety of scaffolds, 
depending on their proficiencies, that allow them to access the same content as their peers. Data from the DRP,

NYSESLAT, and additional one-on-one reading and writing assessments provide formative and a benchmark data to 
support teachers with addressing student needs. 

  

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

At UASGC, we value the elements of the Framework for Great Schools. The previous year, we focused intensively on 
building collaborative teachers through Department and Grade Teams. Department Teams focused on developing 
clear vertical alignment documents to ensure that curriculum and instruction progressed meaningfully from grades 9 
through 12. Additionally, we continued to focus on Supportive Environment through intensive work on our program 
of Restorative Practices. We have set the support systems in place through the Supportive Environment, Collaborative 
Teachers and Rigorous Instruction to be prepared focusing most intensively on Student Achievement in the 2017-
2018 school year. Finally, we have worked to maintain our strong industry partnerships to provide students access to 
opportunities within the Strong Community Ties component of the Framework. 

 

We have made great progress in all of these areas, as indicated by our Quality Review, which took place in February 
2017. We received a Well Developed in both Culture Indicators, as well in the Leveraging Resources/Partnerships 
indicator (aligned to the Supportive Environment and Strong Family-Community Ties indicators). In the QR, families 
indicated that one of the school's strengths is the culture that teachers have built around the importance of post-
secondary choices, which directly connects to our mission statement. Additionally, in reviewing our OORs data, we 
made marked improvement in reducing the total number of incidents in the school and lowered our suspension rate 
to about 30% of what it was in the previous year (even with an increase in the number of students in the school). This 
also shows the progress that we have made in the area of Supportive Environment. 

 

In the QR, we received Proficient ratings in the Teacher Teams indicator, as well as Curriculum, showcasing our 
progress in the Collaborative Teachers and Rigorous Instruction components. Our next steps are to focus on 
increasing the alignment of our Instruction and Assessment to the Essential Features, continuing to improve in the 
area of Rigorous Instruction and then Student Achievement. We are organizing our work for the coming year to focus 
intensively on improving classroom instruction and school-wide systems of assessment. 

 

On the School survey, students, teachers and parents rated the school above 96% in categories relating to cultural 
awareness and Teacher collaboration. 95% of parents/guardians strongly agreed that teaches and parents/guardians 
are partners in education their children. 100% of teachers also strongly agreed that they have the tools and resources 
they need to provide quality instruction to meet the individual needs of students.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
We utilized a range of data sources to determine the areas of focus for the 2018-2019 school year, including Regents 
results (Administrations from January 2015 through June 2018), course credit accumulation data (2016-2018), 2016-
2017 OORs data, 2017 Quality Review feedback, PPO feedback and the 2017-18 Learning Environment Survey data.  

In reviewing the alignment between credit accumulation and Regents results, there is a gap between student 
performance in classes and student performance on Regents assessments. Additionally, feedback from the PPOs and 
the Quality Review indicate that Rigorous Instruction is a significant growth area for the UASGC community in the 
2017-2018 school year.  

To this end, we have developed an instructional focus aimed at improving rigorous instruction within and across 
classrooms: 

At UASGC, students learn grade-level content through reading, discussion and writing. They engage in difficult 
tasks, that promote deep analysis and evidence-based discussion and writing. Teachers support this by creating 
school-wide assessment criteria so that all students are aware of learning expectations, through feedback aligned 
to these expectations. To increase student voice, collaboration and independence with grade level content, 
teachers and students ask high-level questions that promote thinking, and as a result, facilitate meaningful 
discussion and writing that is grounded in evidence. This focus on command of knowledge and evidence, builds a 
trusting and collaborative culture that prepares students for their academic, professional, social, and emotional 
futures after high school .  

To support this focus, we will use the data that we acquired through our Spring 2018 Department Led Inquiry Cycle, 
to study our instructional focus: 

Instructional Focus 

Teachers will focus on improving how they teach analysis and command of evidence in order to improve students 
skills with reading, discussion and writing. 

 

Learner Centered Problem  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

While many students can identify details relating to a claim, they struggle to find evidence that are relevant, 
precise, and sufficient and they struggle to explain why their evidence support their analysis using academic 
vocabulary. 

Problem of Practice 

While we all teach analysis and command of evidence, as teachers we do not have a shared understanding around 
best practices for this and we struggle to explain, provide models, and facilitate student mastery through discussion 
and writing 

Teachers will meet weekly in grade teams to create tasks and analyze student work in service of improving mastery 
of this instructional focus. Additionally, Department teams have chosen common-core and standards aligned 
curriculum to implement in each of the core content areas. teachers will meet in department teams and common 
planning teams to unpack embedded assessments and plan instructional sequences that build towards these 
assessments. Finally, our special ed department will work with small groups of students identified through DRP 
data to address foundational reading skills gaps, using the Rewards Reading program. 

Team leads and admin will meet regularly as an instructional cabinet to unpack teacher evaluation and classroom 
walk-through data and to facilitate the norming of the Danielson components in support of this work.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

By June 2019, we will effectively increase the level of rigor across classes, as evidenced by a 4 % increase in the 
average number of students demonstrating college readiness in ELA Regents exams from, 16 % to 20 %, and Algebra 
Regents from 6% to 10%.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Professional development, beginning on Chancellor's Conference 
Day June 7th, 2018; New teacher on-boarding; PD for teachers in 
pre-opening sessions, Co-planning structures for teachers to 
work on Unit planning during Prose and common planning time. 

Department Team Leaders and Admin engage in retreat to map 
out Department team work for the 2018-2019 school year 

Grade Teams conduct regular planning sessions with Advisory 
teams to develop common structures for developing academic, 
social emotional and college and career goals. Department team 
leaders will meet with their department teams to review current 
and existing curriculum and evaluate the rigor of unit tasks. 
Grade teams will run cycles of inquiry around assessment and 
feedback.  

Department teams will develop coherent units that build 
towards an end of unit task and that include opportunities for 
formative assessment. They will implement the unit, adjusting 
instruction in response to the formative assessment 
opportunities, and analyze the resulting student work from the 
end of unit tasks, to inform the instructional focus around 
teaching and learning. 

Teachers regularly analyze data in Department and Grade Teams: 
Attendance, academic progress, teacher anecdotals, Regents, 
Mock Regents, DRP, and embedded curricular assessments. 

Program multiple teachers to teach Algebra and ELA to create 
authentic co-planning environment. Common planning time 
dedicated to daily lesson planning .  

To provide high-quality mathematics and mathematics-related 
education to all students, the math department will meet weekly 
and develop students’ written and verbal communication skills 
using the Hockman Techniques , including using technical 
vocabulary, constructing viable arguments, and critiquing the 
reasoning of others, through use of curriculum and methods of

best learn mathematics. Math department focus is to develop 
students’ written and verbal communication skills, including 
using technical vocabulary, constructing viable arguments, and 
critiquing the reasoning of others.  

To provide high-quality ELA and ELA-related education to all 
students, the ELA department will meet weekly and develop 
students’ written and verbal communication skills using the 
Hockman method.  

Prose and Common planning time have been restructured to give 
Sped/ELL and co-teacher time and resources to add 
modifications and instructional strategies to the units. 

We will administer early diagnostic tests of basic skills and map 
out intervention for students that are not reaching the 
standards. Departments will develop a student tracker for each 
unit to identify the prerequisites skills that students need and 
track individual and student progress and class trends.  

SpEd and Ell teachers will address literacy gaps in a subset of 
students identified through DRP scores, using the Rewards 
program. Pull out instruction will be conducted during students’ 
ELA classes, during the group work portion of the lesson, 3x per 
week.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
During the 2018-2019 school year, there will be an increase of parent workshops and student-centered events within 
the school so that parents and families feel welcomed and encouraged to engage with the school and support student 
achievement. At UASGC, we believe that the Advisor plays a critical part in establishing a bridge between schools and 
families. The Advisory program will provide guidance for pursuing an integrated strategy to support the exchange of 
information, purposeful interaction, and meaningful participation among schools, families, and community partners 
to support student learning and achievement. Through the advisory program, we will work to help families 
understand our instructional focus and partner with them to best support their children in completing end of unit 
tasks. Through the use of Skedula, Remind, general outreach, parents will have frequent understanding of student's

success. Parent-teacher Conferences will also be an opportunity to communicate with families. Our 5and5 (5 positive 
anecdotes and 5 positive phone calls) program will increase parent to teacher relationships.  

  

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
As we do each year, we will allocate the TL Vision for School Improvement money for summer PD and pre-opening PD 
session. We will engage all teachers in three half day sessions to prepare for the 2018-2019 school year. Additionally, 
as a PROSE school, we utilize our early release time on Wednesdays to engage adult teams in this work. Finally, 
teacher leaders will meet once weekly with the Principal or AP to discuss progress towards instructional goals and 
evaluate school wide progress towards improved implementation of rigorous tasks through the norming of Danielson 
1a, 1e, 3b, c & d. Teachers receive per session and per diem to engage in team meetings, instructional planning, 
tutoring, and professional learning. Additionally teachers are provided with the curricula, trade books, and additional 
instructional resources to ensure that they have all the necessary resources to provide state of the art, standards-
aligned instruction for both core and CTE classes. The addition of a new CTE classroom with 3-d printers and robotics 
tools was funded by one of our CTE partners. Additional partners fund after school programs such as music and art.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
 

One of the areas of focus for school leadership is in developing a consistent system to evaluate progress towards full 
implementation of our instructional focus: 

Teachers will focus on improving how they teach analysis and command of evidence in order to improve students 
skills with reading, discussion and writing. 

We will utilize DRP results and January Regents to evaluate the impact of teachers' improvement of instructional 
practices on student progress.  

By February 2019, we will effectively increase the level of rigor in classrooms as evidenced by a 2% average 
increase in DRP literacy rates. 

  
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
We will utilize DRP results, Mock regents data, and January Regents to evaluate the impact of teachers' improvement 
of instructional practices on student progress. This analysis will happen within Department Teams, facilitated by 
Department team leaders. The instructional cabinet will also take teacher progress into account as it evaluates overall 
school progress.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
We believe that building strong relationships and a strong sense of school culture and community are essential in 
helping students be successful in school. This year, we have demonstrated great success in improving school culture 
and building a strong community through our intensive school-wide implementation of Restorative Practices. For 
School year 2017-18, we are hiring an experienced Dean to support with the implementation of positive incentives to 
foster a supportive environment for both students and teachers. 

 

Our current year to date attendance rate is 79 %, a drop from previous years. The hiring of a new Parent Coordinator 
and the restructuring of our attendance plan will improve attendance for the SY 1018-19. Additionally, the creation of 
a COSA position will improve extra curricular activities for students, making it more appealing to attend beyond just 
academic classes. This year our Seniors and our Freshman and the strongest attendance rates of juniors and 
sophomores. Knowing this, we will work to be more proactive about sophomore and junior attendance in the 2018-
2019 school year and also plan engagement activities for all students to increase their attendance. We will also 
restructure the Attendance Team in the next school year and reorganize the process for attendance taking and 
outreach to families in the 2018-2019 school year. 

 

We want to continue working on this area for the 2018-2019 School Year and have set out the following priorities in 
the area of Improving Culture Systems (Some of these priorities also overlap with Strong Family-Community Ties). 

 

1. Leverage Advisory and grade teams to consolidate communication to families and students and increase 
accountability for students' attendance, credit accumulation and progress towards graduation and college and career 
readiness. 

2. Refine discipline systems, including developing a dedicated Dean of Culture to have a fair and transparent process 
for discipline that embeds Restorative Practices at every level, resulting in lowered suspension OORs rates and 
improved metrics on the Learning Environment survey. 

3. Develop additional access points for parent participation, resulting in increased parent involvement through 
volunteering, celebrations and creative methods of engagement.

Much of this work will also take place within our Culture Team which focuses on Social and Emotional Learning at the 
school. This team works with teachers, students and families on improving school culture through our Restorative 
Practices program.  

 

Finally, the administrative cabinet will collaboratively work on creating monthly town halls that will celebrate student 
achievement as well as attendance as a way to build student culture and engagement. This town halls program, 
coupled with our COSA, after school enrichment programs, Advisory and Grade Programs, will yield an increase in 
student attendance. We will also work to refine and revise our attendance systems and increase the amount of parent 
engagement in the attendance process.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the school culture and learning environment will more effectively support the academic and personal 
growth of students, as evidenced by an increase in the number of students with 90% and above attendance, from to 
48% to 55%. By June 2019, we will also decrease the number of students that are designated as Severely Chronically 
Absent from 27% to 20%.

In partnership with the Urban Assembly network and our CTE 
partners, along-side the work of our CTE Partnership 
Coordinator, as a committee of adult learners, we will 
continue to pinpoint the values that make UASGC unique, and 
wrestle with those ideas as they connect to our own lives. 
With an additional focus on staff development, we will take 
those ideas and develop ways to engage the staff community 
at large in discussion, and bring these ideas to our students in 
advisory, curriculum and through school-wide programming. 
Teachers should be interested in a combination of their own 
learning, in leadership development, and in focusing on the 
mission of UASGC. This committee will do this through:  

Consistent Vision and Core Values embedded in curriculum 
and instructional experiences throughout all classrooms

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
During our Accepted Students' Night, families will be informed about the restorative approaches this school takes as 
an alternative means to punitive forms of discipline. When students are involved in a restorative intervention, their 
families will be notified and invited to participate in the intervention depending on the depth of the situation. Families 
will also be notified based on the outcome of that intervention by the student's advisor. During parent orientation 
and conferences in September, restorative justice coordinator will conduct workshops to inform parents of student 
services.  

Advisors will conduct weekly parent outreach and continue to log 5 positive referrals through our online 
parent/student system skedula. Through Skedula parents have real time data about their children's attendance, 
academic progress, behavior and positive referrals. Parents and students will receive monthly heatmap student 
profile data . Advisors will email parents information on how we support students through our restorative justice 
approach. Parents will be invited to our monthly townhalls to celebrate student achievement. Parents will also get 
important information via our automatic phone system.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As shared in the previous sections, we have demonstrated strength in building out our teacher teams this year, 
indicated by our Proficient rating on the Quality Review in the Teacher Team indicator. We want to continue 
leveraging this strength in our school, as we are already seeing a positive impact on teachers practice. For instance, all 
Department Teams are meeting regularly and all department teams engaged in at least one cycle of inquiry, looking at 
student work to drive changes to their instructional practice. Additionally, Department Teams all engaged in rounds of 
intervisitations, visiting each other's classrooms and provided feedback to each other. We want to expand this work 
into next year, through the support of the Teacher Facilitators and grade Team leaders to further expand our work in 
this Framework Element. 

 

Overview of Professional Learning at UASGC: 

At UASGC, we believe professional learning should be differentiated, teacher-driven and rooted in teacher inquiry 
team work. We value collaboration and teacher-leadership. In the 2018-2019 school year, we shifted in our approach 
to professional learning to one of small group inquiry throughout teacher teams within the school. We are also 
working to build capacity within the staff to expand access to coaching, so that teachers are able to work with non-
administrative coaches to implement feedback and learn new instructional strategies. 

Teacher teams are primarily organized into Grade and Department Teams. Teacher-leaders will receive on-going 
facilitator training to lead their teams through Department Team Facilitators Meetings on Mondays after school and 
Grade Team Facilitators Meetings on Tuesdays after school.  

Modes of Instructional Improvement (How do teachers improve their practice at UASGC?) 

  Direct Coaching by Instructional Facilitators 
  Direct Coaching by External Coaches (Borough Field Support, Superintendent's office, Urban Assembly) 
  External PDs 
  Department Intervisitations, Aligned to Inquiry Work, Taking Ideas from Colleagues 
  Observation of Model Classrooms

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

From the initial development of the school proposal in 2012 and through the transition of the new Principal in Spring 
2017, we identified three Core Values that drive all of the work within the school, from the Principal’s approach to 
leadership to interactions adults and students – Collaboration, Respect and Diligence.  

In service of the Core Value of Collaboration, school leaders have actively worked to develop teacher and staff teams 
that meet regularly and have clear, established buckets of work on which to focus. Teams are critical to the 
functioning of the school and drive the work around instruction, student interventions and support, attendance, 
operations and post-secondary preparation. The principal has also prioritized hiring and built a strong team of 
collaborative professionals who believe that team work is central to the success of all students at UASGC.  

Building collaborative teams and expanding distributive leadership opportunities was a significant success of the 
2017-2018 school year. We firmly believe that effective school leaders involve many members of the community in 
making decisions in the school and leading initiatives. The more teachers and staff members are engaged in doing the 
meaningful work in the school, the better the school and students will perform.  

We will continue to grow our teacher-leadership and focus school leaders on improving their work to, in turn, 
improve teacher pedagogy, resulting in improved student achievement.  

As mentioned in the previous section, we have outlined specific areas of focus for the 2018-2019 school year. The 
areas of focus that are aligned to Effective School Leadership are: 

1. Develop teacher-facilitators to support instructional improvement through coaching, evaluate quality of curriculum 
and tasks and facilitate teams to use assessment data and student work analysis, resulting in improved teacher 
practice (and student achievement). 

2. Focus school leader feedback and feedback processes/routings around Danielson and alignment to literacy and 
content standards, resulting in improved teacher practice (and student achievement). 

3. Develop system for school leaders to regularly evaluate progress towards instructional improvement (including 
teacher practice and student learning. 

4. Ensure roles and responsibilities of out of classroom staff are clearly defined and understood by all and that team 
members are held accountable for their roles and responsibilities and systems under their role, resulting in school 
leaders focusing on instruction and culture, increased communication and increased accountability for student 
performance outcomes.

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, school leaders will build teachers’ capacity to use assessment in the classroom, including an aligned end-

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By February 2019, we will see an improvement in teacher pedagogical practice, as indicated by the Danielson Rubric 
(a 0.2 growth, from a 2.4 to a 2.6 in 3B- Questioning and Discussion), as well as improvement in student performance, 
as indicated by Regents pass rates. We will regularly analyze the progress of teachers' pedagogical growth within our 
Instructional Cabinet. Utilizing TeachBoost as well as an internal feedback monitoring system, we will ensure that 
there is regular and continuous reflection on how teacher practice is improving.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

According to the 2017-2018 NYC Survey, 67% (City average 89%) of teachers agreed that, at their school, teachers 
work closely with families to meet students' needs and 72 % (City Average 90%) teachers agreed or strongly agrees 
that, at their school, school staff regularly communicate with parent/guardian about how parents/guardian can help 
students learn. At UASGC, we believe that the the Advisor is the key person that helps establish and sustain the 
relationship between school, student and parent. The new Resilient Scholars curriculum along with the 6 week 
advisory cycle that includes goal setting, will give advisors tools and resources to communicate with students and 
parents During CTE classes, we will institute and messaged the career pathways for all students and communicate 
those pathways with parents with newsletters and a workshops during Parent-Teacher Conferences. We will also 
expose all grades to the College and Career Trajectory plan.  

We have many resources/partnerships at the school to support student and family social and emotional health, 
including a guidance counselor, Advisors ,CTE Partnership Coordinator a Youth Development Leader and our arts 
partnership with The Apollo Theater. We also have a school-wide grading policy and now use Skedula so parents can 
log in and see grades and email teachers at their convenience. We will pilot the new text feature on skedula to send 
periodic informative and positive messages to parents.  

Our focus for this year is to strengthen our outreach to parents by using advisory to set, revisit and reflect on goals. 
Using this cycle through out our marking period allows us to use the Wednesday Prose time to communicate with 
parents in a positive and informative manner. and to best use the additional constructional hours for parent outreach 
to build stronger relationships with our parents.  

Our Areas of Strength: 

 Systems of home-school communication include text blasts and phone blasts.  

 Events planned for Parent Engagement, including Summer BBQ, Thanksgiving Potluck, Breakfast with the Principal 
and others. 

 Monthly parent outreach events planned and executed, in addition to Open School Night and Curriculum night. 

 Allocation of resources to provide for a Partnership Coordinator who develops and maintains relationships with 
partners, including Community-Based organizations and industry partners, to provide enrichment experiences for our 
students.

 Partnership with and support from the Urban Assembly to build strong network of enrichment supports for our 
students.  

 Industry partnerships that have allowed students to participate in paid summer internships. 

 Strong work-based learning program that allows students to learn about the supply chain management and freight 
logistics industry in and around the New York City community. 

 Monthly parent newsletter mailed home, featuring enrichment opportunities for our students. 

 

Areas of Growth: 

 Increase the number of parents participating and the range of ability to participate. A few parents participate 
regularly; we need to increase the number of parents who are participating in events. 

 Increase the number of enrichment opportunities available for our students, especially in the areas of visual and 
performing arts.

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

The Administrative Team will work with SLT/PTA to determine 
processes in order to communicate more effectively with parents 
and encourage greater family and community engagement. We 
will utilize “familiesinshool.org,” “sparkaction.org,” and 
“boostup.org” to provide some initial entry point to our work 
and provide us with the ideas about how we can increase and 
improve our communications with families and parents. The 
SLT/PTA will meet monthly with a focus on increase 
parent/community involvement and communication. They will 
help to create strategies and assist in the implementation of 
these strategies. The SLT/PTA will lead a Freshman parent 
orientation and curriculum night in September. The parent 
coordinator and SLT/PTA will gather data from fall's parent 
orientation and curriculum night and continue outreach to 
parents, as evidenced through parent phone calls and e-mails, 
documented on Skedula. This team will determine if family 
participation and involvement goals are reaching success 
through weekly meetings.  

The school will host four parent/teacher nights per year (two 
more than the mandated DOE parent/teacher nights) when our 
mid-cycle grade reports are released to communicate with 
parents how students can pass the cycle. Mid and end cycle 
progress reports will be mailed home six times a year. The 
administrative team will will use an online grading system 
(Skedula) that allows parents and students to access all grades 
for all classes. The school will host parent workshops on the 
following topics during the year.  

● Using Skedula and the UASGC website  

● College application process and financial aid (Juniors) 

● Our CTE and Internship Program

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
UASGC has a hiring committee that operates to develop and refine hiring practices for the school. We have developed 
a rigorous rubric for evaluating teacher candidates that is aligned to our core values and beliefs about children and 
how they learn best. The hiring committee begins work in February of each year to identify and begin the recruitment 
process for teachers at UASGC. All teachers must complete a demonstration lesson with at least one group of 
students at the school, during the regular school day, prior to being considered for a position. 

We determine needed qualifications for teachers in the early stages of the hiring committee and identify potential 
candidates based on their demonstrated qualifications. Teachers are assigned specifically based on their license area 
and in accordance with the needs of the department. We hire specifically to pair newer teachers with more 
experienced teachers. 

We have weekly professional development sessions that are collaboratively planned by the Instructional Cabinet. This 
committee consists of the Principal, AP, UFT Chapter Chair and Teacher Team Leaders and teachers from each 
instructional department to ensure that all voices from the teaching staff are heard within these meetings. We 
evaluate the impact of professional development by conducting regular inter visitations with members of the 
Instructional Cabinet. 

We engage faculty in a wide range of community building activities to ensure that staff feel connected to each other 
and the larger school community. Additionally, we have embedded a mentoring program to support new teachers 
through partnerships with experienced teachers in the school.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
PD is collaboratively developed by the PD Committee, which includes members of all teaching departments as well as 
the UFT Chapter Chair and the Principal. To ensure that we are aligning our work to the rigorous demands of the 
Common Core, we have identified a high leverage Common Core standard, aligned to our instructional focus of 
reading, writing and speaking, to continually study and evaluate student work and its alignment to this standard. We

focus our study of student work as well as intervisitations around this focus standard. To uimprove pedogogy, we will 
focus our Professional Development on 1e and 3d 

Additionally, we regularly provide feedback to teachers around the implementation of the Common Core standards 
identified in teacher-developed unit plans. Additionally, we provided pre-opening professional development during 
the summer that allowed teachers to engage with the expectations of the standards and bring them into their regular 
planning practices. Paraprofessionals are also included in our professional development program.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. THe Urban Assembly for Global Commerce, in compliance with the Section 
1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The Urban Assembly School for Global Commerce will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions;

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

The Urban Assembly School for Global Commerce, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of 
student achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and 
programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) Exams, WIST, and Department created reading, writing, and speaking  CCLS aligned 
assessments.    
The insight of the data has shown that in general ELL students perform lower in reading assessments than the other school 
populations.  This information is used to develop school-wide literacy programs and classes, and ENL teachers provided 
targeted instruction through push-in and pull-out.  This is reflected in our school schedule.  We will continue to gather data 
around language acquisition through regularly scheduled DRP assessments that will help us see growth and target instruction.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

We meet at the beginning of each semester as a department to review data and make sure that students’ schedules 
appropriately cover their needs. We also meet with content teachers to review data and discuss how ELLs can be supported in 
their content area classes. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Students’ performance on classroom activities, Regents exams, Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) scores, NYSESLAT scores    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We meet at the beginning of each semester as a department to review data and make sure that students’ schedules 
appropriately cover their needs. We also meet with content teachers to review data and discuss how ELLs can be supported in 
their content area classes. Additionally, grades are updated weekly. We review class work feedback with students and meet to 
discuss low assessment scores when necessary. We also use class assessments to guide or alter class assignments and lessons. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
NYSESLAT, and ELA/US/Global Regents are given the most priority when evaluating and informing our ELL programs. The 
majority of our schedules are focused on supporting the students in their ELA and Social Studies classes as this is where they 
have shown the most need. These assessments will not only determine their class schedule, it will also determine how often 
they will receive support from the ELL teachers in either standalone or co-taught classes. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The scheduling team and the ENL department work closely together to make sure that programs reflect students’ needs. We 
use NYSESLAT scores to determine who will be given a period of Standalone ENL, and we use Regents scores to make decisions 
regarding which content classes will be co-taught by an ENL teacher. Once initial programs have been created by the 
scheduling team each semester, they are reviewed by the ENL department before being finalized. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The program is determined by grade and proficiency level. As we have a small school and a small number of ELLs, we 
are able to create the program to integrate most students into one standalone class every weekday. This standalone 
class is mostly transitioning and entering students -- the students that require the most minutes with an ENL teacher 
per week. The students that have reached expanding or commanding are either in half week classes or only receive 
co-taught instruction in either ELA or History classes. 
 
Most of the students that are the same grade level and proficiency level are group together and often have many of 
their core content classes together. This can only change if a student has passed the Regents and the class and does 
not need to fulfill that requirement anymore. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

ELL students receive different amount of instructional minutes based on their proficiency level.  ELL students with beginner to 
transitioning proficiencies are programmed with an alternate schedule where they can receive ENL class in place of literacy 
class.  An ENL teacher will also co-teach either their ELA or History class. Students with expanding to commanding proficiencies 
will be placed in co-taught ELA or History classes (based on their Regents scores). 
 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Teachers are responsible for translating documents as well as providing scaffolded activities and questions. GoogleTranslate is 
also utilized to meet the needs of ELL students with monolingual staff. Students are provided with ipads or laptops to facilitate 
their inclusion and participation in classroom discussions and activities.    
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Informal assessment of home language by bilingual teachers; analysis of classwork collected in the home language; additional 
protocol to be established to evaluate students’ home language. If there is no teacher that supports a specific home language, 
outreach to parents is done to ensure that they are still utilizing the home language in order to foster growth in both English 
and their native language. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. Create material to meet students at their level of understanding including pictures, graphic organizers, multimodal 
materials, technology that supplements language acquisition, and use home language to build their vocabulary.  Offer 
alternate assignments and assessments so that students have the opportunity to demonstrate growth. b.  Scaffold instruction 
using home language to build their academic vocabulary, translate documents, and use of multilingual word walls.  Depending 
on availability bilingual staff will also provide language support in their classes. c. Assessments are provided in their home 
language as well as English so that students can translate the academic content.  We also provide bilingual glossaries. Students 
are also provided with modifications on assignments, as well as additional support by meeting with their content and ESL 
teachers to improve their craft.d. We use school-wide focus on reading, writing, and speaking skills to develop meta cognition 
and meta-linguistic skillse. All previous strategies are available if needed, and will be used depending on student need to 
understand the content. Additional support in grammatical and morpho-syntax.

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

Teachers use bilingual glossaries, google translate for oral and written activities, multilingual word walls, and create scaffolded 
assignments with focus on whole language development. 
 
Below is a supporting document that is staff is given.   
Below are some of the accommodations it is their right to receive: 
All ELLs get extended time (time and a half) on major projects and assignments.  This includes major project deadlines as well 
as in-class tests/quizzes.  ELLs should also get extended time when answering any oral assessment content questions. 
All ELLs are entitled to a bilingual/English dictionary on major tests and assignments, including the Regents Examinations 
Please note that they are not entitled to an English-only dictionary 
When doing oral examinations, ELLs should be read the questions/passages aloud multiple times, as in the Regents 
Below are some accommodations that we recommend: 
Many ELLs struggle with English grammar and punctuation.  Allow ELLs to complete extra drafts and give them explicit 
grammar corrections so that their ideas are not marred by their language skills. 
Sit ELLs next to bilingual peers or have bilingual peers sit in on their presentations, if possible.  Allow these peers to translate 
questions/assignments for low-level ELLs. 
Modify assignments for low-level ELLs.  For example, if the class is writing a 4 page essay and you have a beginner ELL who is 
struggling with English, their assignment could be to write one, strong paragraph in English.  If you are doing a Science 
experiment and they need to do a several-page write-up, allow beginner ELLs to demonstrate their understanding in a 
different way, and modify the length expectations of the write-up. 
Below are some accommodations you should avoid: 
Do not allow ELLs to translate huge passages of their work via an online translator.  This often results in a nonsensical text and 
is not helping them learn English.  Instead, allow them to use online translators to translate individual words, when they are at 
a level at which they can provide some words in English themselves 
Do not allow ELLs to copy from their peers.  Often beginner ELLs will attempt to do this in groupwork.  Instead, encourage ELLs 
to write whatever they can in whatever language, and then have their peers (or you) help to translate and revise it. 
Do not set low-expectations for ELLs.  They should be working hard in your class.  Give alternative assignments instead of 
simply cutting assignments.  If you have modified the length of an assignment, make sure they are putting in a similar amount 
of work as their peers by requiring multiple drafts and deep thinking in their work.  Call home when they are not participating, 
just as you would for any other ELL.  Bilingual office staff and Team 5 teachers can help make these phone calls.  You can also 
use the DOE’s translation hotline: 718-752-7373 ext. 4. 
 
Special Accommodations for Beginner Level ELLs 
Every spring, all ELLs are given the NYSESLAT exam, which determines their official level of English proficiency.  Newcomers 
(students who came to this country less than a year ago) and beginner level ELLs (as determined by the NYSESLAT) are allowed 
special modifications at FHS: 
Beginner ELLs are allowed to complete 9th and 10th grade portfolios in their native language and/or a mix of their native 
language and English.  If possible, they should be put in groups with facilitators and peers who speak their native language 
Beginner ELLs are allowed to complete the work presented and content knowledge section of their panels in their native 
language, with a facilitator who speaks their native language.  They should still be writing their papers and cover letters in 
English, for all subjects. 
It is important to recognize that beginner ELLs will have a different role in your classroom than other students.  You need to 
modify assignments for them to be successful.  This does not mean that you need to translate all assignments into their native 
language.  Instead, you should play around with some of the following ideas: 
o Sit them in heterogeneous groups with higher-level bilingual students 
o Allow them to use dictionaries and online translators to access the material 
o Modify the length of written assignments to fit what each student is capable of 
o Give lists of sentence starters to help students begin the writing process in English 
o Allow peers to translate written and verbal instructions for them 
o Try to include multiple intelligences in your lessons – don’t just rely on verbal and written skills. (For example, many ELLs feel 
most successful when completing math projects, hands-on science experiments, or activities that involve music or visuals) 
o Put Spanish subtitles on any movies you show

o Give ELLs a preview of the material the day before, through pictures or their native language, so that they can participate 
fully despite the language gap in the following day’s lesson 
 
REMEMBER!!! 
***Many ELLs also receive Special Education services.  Make sure you are also adhering to the modifications they are 
guaranteed on their IEPs. 
***Over-the-phone translation services are available for free from the Department of Education.  Call their translation hotline 
at 718-752-7373 ext. 4. 
 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
As a community, UASGC values an inclusion model, but we also recognize that students might struggle as a part of this process, 
especially several of our students come from a school environment that is called “Special Class” or “Self Contained” meaning 
they are in a small class with the same group of kids and the same teacher all day.  Although there are benefits to this 
experience as it pertains to skills, it is not supposed to be a place where students stay forever.  We recognize that a student 
can’t BE special ed because special education is a service, they receive special education services with the goal and intentions 
of entering the least restrictive environment for their needs.  Scheduling allows students to have multiple program settings in 
one IEP, for example, they may need Pull out/Push in for Math, but ICT for English.  In Science, the young person may need no 
support at all. 
  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
In all content areas, the targeted interventions include Saturday school invitations for extra prep time for the Regents. The ENL 
department will support the grade teams in understanding and knowing how best to support the students in their classes.  For 
reading, there is also a targeted pull out class that focuses on foundational reading and phonics. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We have organized time in the summer to meet and curriculum plan as a department. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All students have the opportunity to sign up for the Big Brothers Big Sisters mentoring program, sports teams, variety of 
enrichment activities after school, Saturday Academy activities, and special focus is made to allow students to participate in 
field day activities.  ELL students are provided interpretation/translation of all documents regarding any enrichment 
opportunities. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
When practicing for the Regents, students are provided translated exams or translated questions. Rosetta Stone is used to 
provide supplemental practice  to help students develop their reading, speaking, and writing skills.  In addition, students carry 
ipads and laptops to support their learning and communication with their teachers.  Bilingual dictionaries are provided for 
each student. 
 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

Home language is utilized to build students’ academic vocabularies. Materials provided to students are provided in their home 
language as well as English. Home language is also used to scaffold instruction. Documents are translated, and multilingual 
word walls are utilized.  Assessments are provided in their home language as well as English so that students can translate the 
academic content.  We also provide bilingual glossaries. Students are also provided with modifications on assignments, as well 
as additional support by meeting with their content and ESL teachers to improve their craft. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
The school utilizes the students’ home-language academic level as well as their NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, and DRP exams to 
establish the grade level (in English) at which students are functioning, and use scaffolds as necessary to ensure the growth of 
these students. 
 
From our Grading Policy Intervention Document, students can request the following accommodations: 
Homework: 
·         Depending on the assignment and their workload in all classes, some special education students may not have the 
stamina to complete an assignment at the same level as their peers.  They can be given an opportunity to revise their 
assignment if they wish to earn a higher grade. 
 
Formative Assessments: 
·         Quizzes:  Students need to mark at the top of the paper that they did not have time to complete it and then come after 
school or during lunch.  You can also allow them to multi task during the next part of the lesson if that works for what you are 
teaching, without announcing it to the class.  Just give the student a “look” saying, “Keep working, you’re doing good” 
·         Oral Presentations:  Never rush then to complete the presentation.  If they are struggling due to being nervous, you can 
ask them to videotape it or complete it in a smaller group setting at a later time. 
·         Reading and Writing:   They may require additional time after school or during lunch to finish the assignment. 
·         Revision:  The majority of our students require two to three drafts of a paper to get a passing score.  With ELL  students, 
it may take them 5 or 6.  If they choose, they can continue to revise (even for a formative assessment) 
·         Please note:  STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO TURN IN DRAFTS EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT COMPLETE.  (in other words, they 
can’t just “do nothing” and then say “I get extended time” and expect that to happen.  The Drafts serve as benchmarks to 
EARN extended time to get to the next round. 
 
Summative Assessments 
·         In Class Essay: They may require additional time after school or during lunch to finish the assignment. 
·         Test:  Some need a separate location or additional time.  They must get this in order to be in compliance with their IEP. 
·         Project/Paper: Revision:  The majority of our students require two to three drafts of a paper to get a passing score.  With 
ELL students, it may take them 5 or 6.  If they choose, they can continue to revise (even for a formative assessment) 
·Please note:  STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO TURN IN DRAFTS EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT COMPLETE.  (in other words, they can’t 
just “do nothing” and then say “I get extended time” and expect that to happen.  The drafts serve as benchmarks to EARN 
extended time to get to the next round. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Rosetta Stone and Duolingo are used to provide supplemental practice  to help students develop their reading, speaking, and 
writing skills.  In addition, students carry ipads and laptops to support their learning and communication with their 
teachers.  Bilingual dictionaries are provided for each student. 
 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
When students first enter the school a multidisciplinary team meets with the student.  The school administrator, guidance 
counselor, secretary, and ESL/ENL teacher meet with the new student and provide orientation in a small group setting 
designed specifically for ELL newcomers.  The new student is paired up with another student who speaks the native 
language/dialect. This student will help the newcomer assimilate into the school community. Staff uses technology such as 
Google Translate, a translator, or the DOE translation hotline to inform the student regarding rules, regulations, and every-day 
procedures of the school. If no one who speaks the native language is available, an interpreter is hired for the day. New-

coming ELL students are given pictorial props to express basic needs, such as using the bathroom.  Ipads and laptops are also 
provided for students to aid and foster communication. 
 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Mandarin and Spanish 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

 
N/A 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Select teachers will be sent to DOE for PD and will then be expected to share the training with the rest of the school staff 
Developing students’ capacity for writing argumentatively and responding argumentatively, while ensure that students have 
the opportunity to read, write and speak consistently within daily classroom instruction. 
Theory of Action: 
Instructional practice impacts student learning 
When we, as a school community, focus on students’ reading, reading, writing and speaking, student reading levels improve, 
as measured by the DRP assessment 
Students need to write and speak daily to improve their writing and response 
Adult team work impacts student achievement   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The PD committee will establish professional development opportunities within the school and ENL teachers will be sent out to 
receive additional PD.  This will be focused on how to engage our ELLs in all content areas. Additional support will revolve 
around reading strategies and comprehension activities. 
  
ELL teachers also lead PDs around strategies to help with ELLs (and specific students in general, as our population is so small). 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

 

Grade-team meetings and parent-teacher conference meetings are provided throughout the year.  Bilingual Spanish teachers 
interpret during conferences, and for other languages we use DOE translators.  ELLs are placed in advisories, like the rest of the 
student body. Their advisors will be responsible for maintaining thorough contact with parents, and will be made aware of the 
DOE phone translation service if they don’t share a common language with the parents. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Translate documents and communication, Thanksgiving Pot luck, talent shows to promote cultural diversity, offered to 
chaperone on trips, teacher availability during parent outreach to discuss student progress.   We will use the DOE translation 
services. Parent Coordinator does intensive outreach to parents for all school events and utilizes bilingual office staff to 
communicate messages verbally to parents over the phone. There is also an annual Multicultural night where students, 
parents and teachers can share their cultures.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Erin Gehant, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,
