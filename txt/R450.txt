Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Curtis will be a nurturing community where all of its members will have the desire and opportunity to achieve their 
fullest potential.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Curtis High School is a comprehensive academic public high school serving grades 9 – 12. After Staten Island 
consolidated with the City of Greater New York in 1898, the first public building erected in the new borough was 
Curtis High School. The school was built on a hill that commands a panoramic view of the New York Harbor, but the 
elevated site was chosen more specifically so the people in Manhattan could see the new school. Since it opened its 
doors in 1904, the school, built in collegiate gothic style, has made its mission to provide excellent education and a 
nurturing community for all of its members. To that end, the school is organized into small learning communities 
(called “houses”) that give students and faculty the opportunity to maximize teaching and learning in a more 
personalized manner. The small learning communities are: 

  Computer Business Institute 

The Computer Business Institute offers students the opportunity to learn Microsoft Office applications, E-Commerce 
and an Introduction to Computer Science which includes web design and computer programming. The course 
sequence leads to an industry-recognized certification as a Microsoft Office Specialist in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 
along with an opportunity to participate in Co-Op education. 

  Human and Legal Studies Academy 

The Human and Legal Studies program offers students the opportunity to gain a basic understanding of law as the 
foundation of human society and our role as citizens in the justice system. In addition to standard academic curricula, 
students interact with representatives from the legal community, including district attorneys, judges and special law 
enforcement agencies like the FBI. 

 

International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (Screened Program) 

The International Baccalaureate program offers students a unique, rigorous curriculum in Humanities and STEM-
related fields authorized by the International Baccalaureate Organization. All students are expected to achieve an 
Advanced Regents Diploma, and will also take numerous Advanced Placement (AP) courses in addition to their 7 
required International Baccalaureate courses. 

  Media Communication & Video Journalism Institute 

The Journalism Institute offers students opportunities to explore the following: writing, layout design, 
photojournalism, documentary film, broadcasting, emerging technologies and print production. Students publish 10 
newspapers annually, a yearbook and literary magazine. The program includes partnerships with colleges and local 
media. 

  Naval Junior ROTC 

The Navy Junior ROTC program is a leadership and citizenship training program co-sponsored by the Department of 
Education and the United States Navy. The curriculum is divided into three areas: academic, military skills and physical 
fitness. 

  Practical Nursing/Nursing Assistant (Screened Program) 

The Nursing program offers two State-approved Career and Technical Education (CTE) health career programs. The 
Practical Nursing program includes 798 clinical hours in addition to the curriculum. These students are then eligible to 
take the NCLEX State Board examination for Licensed Practical Nurse. The Nursing Assistant program includes 108 
clinical hours along with a curriculum that allows students to take the NYS certification exam to be certified as a 
Nursing Assistant.

  Performing Arts 

The Performing Arts program offers students the opportunity to study dance, theatre or music through a variety of 
classes that are enriched by after-school performances and partnerships with Roundabout Theater, Battery Dance 
Company, Theatre for New Audiences and The College of Staten Island. Course offerings include: IB Dance, Modern 
Dance, Ballet, Composition, Theatre I, IB Theatre, Chorus, Piano, Guitar, Orchestra, Concert Band, Symphonic Band 
and Jazz Band. 

 

School for International Studies (SIS)/Honors AVID Program (Screened Program) 

The SIS program offers a challenging curriculum in the humanities and the possibility of a student exchange with the 
Netherlands, Italy, France and/or Spain. All students are expected to take Advancement Via Individual Determination 
(AVID), a minimum of four AP classes, four years of a World Language, IB certificate classes and graduate with a NYS 
Advanced Regents Diploma. 

  Visual Arts 

The Visual Arts program offers students the opportunity to study fine arts or graphic design through a variety of 
classes that are enriched by after-school programs and a design partnership with Roundabout Theater. Course 
offerings include: Drawing, Painting, AP Art History, IB Art and/or CTE Graphic Design using Adobe CS Suite. 

Extracurricular Clubs and Activities 

At Curtis HS, a vast array of extracurricular clubs and activities allow students to explore new or continuing interests 
outside of the traditional classroom. 

PSAL Sports Teams 

At Curtis HS, there is an outstanding tradition of strong PSAL sports teams in both girls and boys sports. Our teams 
routinely compete for Island and Citywide championships under coaches who are predominantly teachers at Curtis 
High School. 

Foreign Exchange Program 

Through our foreign exchange program, Curtis students host visitors from countries such as Spain, Italy, France, and 
Netherlands and also spend time living with families abroad in those countries as well.  

Instructional Support Services 

Students with Disabilities (SWDs) and English Language Learners (ELLs) are provided with instructional support in all 
houses in response to demonstrated needs, as well as, city and state mandates. Based on an historical data review, 
particular attention is given to first and second year students because the possibility for dropping out of high school is 
elevated in those years. A coordinated afterschool program initially designed to support athletes, has expanded to 
include students who are not involved in sports. Forward PASS (Pursuing And Sustaining Success) assigns “success 
coaches” for all participants while structuring activities to ensure academic achievement and youth development. 
Curtis is committed to educating all students in the least restrictive environment. Teachers differentiate instruction in 
response to students’ learning styles and data gathered from multiple sources. 

Curtis HS has built a rich and enduring history of excellence in serving the Staten Island community since opening in 
1904 – making it the oldest public secondary school on Staten Island. Curtis has numerous partnerships with 
community-based organizations who support the academic, social-emotional, and health & well-being of our 
students. Curtis HS is a Community School that partners with Children’s Aid as a lead agency in implementing its 
community school strategy. In addition to the support of a full-time Community School Director (CSD), Children's Aid 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

operates a School-Based Health Center where students receive comprehensive preventive and primary health 
services, including medical, vision, and mental-health services. Through a partnership with the United Federation of 
Teachers Community Learning Schools (CLS) initiative, Curtis is supported by a Resource Coordinator to assist with 
coordinating the services and resources available for our students and their families as well. Our vision is that a 
community school is more than a neighborhood. It is that place in the hearts and minds of its members that 
understands that an obstacle to one is an obstacle to all. The Curtis community school will be a partnership of 
students, parents, staff and community members that invests in creating, supporting, and sustaining learning 
environments that allow students to progress successfully towards college and career goals. 

Career and Technical Education (CTE) 

Through collaborations with various local business and industry partners, Curtis HS offers its students opportunities to 
engage with these CTE partners in career exploration activities, including internships and work-base learning 
experiences. Courses in nursing, computer/business, journalism/new media, law, graphic design, performing arts, and 
fine arts expose students to first-hand learning experiences in career fields of interest and teach students valuable 
post-secondary readiness skills that prepare them college and/or career opportunities beyond Curtis HS. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Curtis High School is a high school that enrolled 2,558 students from grade 9 through grade 12 in 2017-2018. The 
school population comprised 6% Asian, 37% Black, 39% Hispanic, and 16% White students. The student body included 
6% English Language Learners and 19% students with disabilities. Boys accounted for 47% of the students enrolled 
and girls accounted for 53%. The student body included 64% free lunch eligible students. 

 

An analysis of patterns and trends related to achievement of English Language Learners indicates a need for support 
in core content subjects, particularly English Language Arts and Social Studies. Data for Students with Disabilities 
suggests that support is required to improve achievement (particularly credit accumulation) in English Language Arts 
and mathematics. 

Student Achievement: Data from the most recent School Quality Guides indicate the following results in the student 
achievement metrics:

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

In order to improve student achievement, the instructional focus at Curtis for 2018-2019 states that "If we maintain 
structures and protocols to continually deepen the expertise of all faculty and staff within a positive, collaborative 
learning environment, then curriculum & instruction will be strengthened and all students will feel supported and will 
be engaged in activities/experiences that promote high levels of thinking, participation, and ownership that lead to 
college and career readiness." Within this focus there will be an emphasis on continuing to develop teachers' 
expertise and skill in questioning and in facilitating discussions to ensure that instruction is rigorous and aligned to the 
Common Core Learning Standards. In addition, strengthening the formative assessment process will be another key 
area of focus. A third area of focus for 2018-19 will be around implementing culturally relevant education for our 
students. As such, teachers will participate in collaborative professional learning activities and students will engage in 
challenging classroom activities within a safe and supportive environment. 

Framework for Great Schools (FFGS) 

- Rigorous Instruction: Engaging curricula and instruction are provided by nurturing the professional growth of 
teachers and staff. Data from the 2017-18 Quality Review and the NYC School Survey indicate regression in this 
element of the FFGS compared with 2016-17 results. The 2017-18 Framework Element Score = 3.06 (Meeting Target). 

- Supportive Environment: A School-Wide Positive Behavior Support (SWPBS) plan establishes a culture in which 
positive behavior is the norm. Expectation matrices draw attention to explicit positive behaviors to create and 
maintain a supportive and safe learning environment built around the core values of Punctuality, Respect, Integrity, 
Discipline and Effort (P.R.I.D.E.). Data from the 2017-18 Quality Review and the NYC School Survey indicate similar 
performance in this element of the FFGS compared with 2016-17 results. The 2017-18 Survey Element Score = 2.67 
(Approaching Target). 

- Collaborative Teachers: Teachers strengthen the professional learning community by leading and participating in 
professional development. Structures and protocols are embedded, including common professional periods in the 
four major subject areas, that provide a forum for daily and weekly collaboration and continuous improvement. Data 
from the 2017-18 Quality Review and the NYC School Survey indicate similar performance in this element of the FFGS 
compared with 2016-17 results. The 2017-18 Framework Element Score = 3.42 (Meeting Target). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

 

- Effective School Leadership: The leadership team consisting of the principal and assistant principals support building 
capacity and improving results for all through the lens of the FFGS. Data from the 2017-18 Quality Review and the NYC 
School Survey indicate growth in this element of the FFGS compared with 2016-17 results. The 2017-18 Framework 
Element Score = 3.87 (Meeting Target). 

- Strong Family-Community Ties: Partnerships are developed with the assistance of our Community Learning School 
partners, parent coordinator, resource coordinator, PTA, parents, and district leadership, and community-based 
organizations to provide resources to our community school. Data from the 2017-18 Quality Review and the NYC 
School Survey indicate growth in this element of the FFGS compared with 2016-17 results. The 2017-18 Framework 
Element Score = 3.09 (Meeting Target). 

The most progress made between 2016-17 and 2017-18 occurred in the Strong Family-Community Ties element of the 
FFGS. An element of focus for 2018-19 will be Rigorous Instruction which fell from "exceeding target" to "meeting 
target."

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
At Curtis HS students learn best when they are actively engaged in challenging and relevant learning activities and 
assignments that emphasize deep thinking and support the development of understanding. The school’s Instruction 
emphasizes a "practice makes progress" approach where accurate and meaningful feedback guide students toward 
learning targets. 

Such activities most often include high levels of student participation in discussion and reflection.  

Examples of teaching practices that provide multiple entry points, supports, and extensions to all students include: 

 

Lessons that are planned with multiple scaffolds, such as questioning and discussion techniques, graphic 
organizers, sentence starters, and technology, to promote opportunities for all students to be cognitively 
engaged. 

  The grouping of students (whether whole group, small group, or pairs) is done purposefully based on 

knowledge of the students. 

  The grouping of students (whether whole group, small group, or pairs) is done strategically to match the 

lesson targets/objectives and correlated activities. 

Examples of instructional practices that promote high levels of student thinking and participation include: 

  Accountable talk strategies that facilitate student-to-student interaction, build students’ academic 

vocabulary, and maximize opportunities for all students to make their thinking visible. 

  After posing a question, teachers use strategies, such as pair-share and turn-and-talk, to enable students to 

contribute to direct discussion with one another and practice reasoning and communication skills. 

Curtis was designated as a School in Good Standing by the New York State Education Department for the 2017-2018 
school year.

Based on data from School Quality Guide, Quality Review, NYC School Survey, STARS Scholarship Reports, Items Skills 
Analysis Results, and Advance Data Reports, Curtis has developed the following instructional focus for 2018-19: 

IF our faculty and staff work together within a positive, collaborative environment using qualitative and quantitative 
data to ensure every student has access, opportunities, supports, and interventions to learn at high levels and achieve 
their greatest potential, THEN all stakeholders will be engaged in relevant and rigorous activities/experiences that 
promote an equitable, excellent, and empathetic learning environment that ensures the postsecondary readiness of 
every student. 

The following areas will be emphasized in relationship to the instructional focus: Questioning and Discussion 
Techniques, Engaging Students in Learning (Activities and Assignments), and Culturally Responsive 
Teaching/Education. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
To establish and maintain a culture of learning at Curtis HS, messages are communicated about expectations for 
learning, achievement, and effort through various structures. A particular emphasis on four A’s – attitude, 
attendance, achievement, and accountability – has been messaged throughout the school community. In addition, a 
schoolwide positive behavior system (SWPBS) developed around the acronym PRIDE (punctuality, respect, integrity, 
discipline, and effort) was introduced in 2014-15 to celebrate positive behavior. Teacher development is grounded in 
descriptive, actionable feedback connected to the Danielson Framework for Teaching.

As a multi-session school, Curtis HS currently operates under a School-Based Option (SBO) by which structured time is 
scheduled each Wednesday from 7:45-8:45 AM for professional collaborations. Staff meet on Wednesday mornings 
for faculty conferences, professional learning community (PLC) meetings, small learning community (SLC) meetings, 
and professional development cycles. In addition, a daily common planning period is programmed for teachers in the 
four major content areas – English Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies. 

Examples of how teacher teams are promoting the implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards and the 
instructional shifts include: 

  Classroom intervisitations provide opportunities for colleagues to share promising practices and engage in 

 

conversations about implementation of the CCLS and instructional shifts. 
Structured time is strategically scheduled enabling co-teachers in Collaborative Team Teaching classrooms to 
meet and plan regularly. 

  Technology team meetings focus on identifying strategies to appropriately integrate technology into CCLS-

aligned curricula across subjects. 

Examples of the use of data within teacher teams to improve instruction include: 

  Teacher teams for courses within subject areas review item analysis and student-level data to refine 

 

curriculum and create common assessments. 
School data inquiry team reviews Progress to Graduation Tracker data regularly to identify Cohort R students 
for focused intervention planning. 

  Teacher teams use a form of the Atlas protocol for looking at student work to adjust lesson plans and set 

learning targets/objectives. 

Examples of structures to support distributive leadership include: 

  Teacher-led common planning time. 
  Teacher-led intervisitations with colleagues. 
  Measures of Students Learning (MOSL) committee meetings. 
 

Staff-led attendance committee meetings.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The School Leadership Team (SLT) develops the school CEP goals after review of data and with input from all 
stakeholders. All stakeholders understand the school’s long-term vision to increase post-secondary articulation and 
persistence in achieving college and career readiness skills. The SLT and staff regularly review the school’s progress 
towards attaining short-term and long-term goals. 

Based on analyses of an array of data sources, including but not limited to, the 2016-17 School Quality Guide, 2017-18 
NYC School Survey, 2017-18 Quality Review Report, 2018 Panorama Survey, and 2016-17 New York State School 
Report Card, the SLT developed the five goals for its 2018-19 Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). 

The school has formed a number of strong partnerships in its community school to support all learners in meeting 
academic and social development needs. Two lead CBOs, Children’s Aid and the UFT Community Learning Schools 
Initiative, have emerged as indispensable partners in the community school work. 

The principal and cabinet make on-going strategic and sustainable decisions that are aligned with the school's goals. 
Funding decisions include identifying non-DOE resources to support capital, operational and academic needs. 

The principal and assistant principals provide timely and actionable feedback aligned to the Danielson Framework for 
Teaching. They use Advance observation data and other measures for teacher development and to provide on-going 
targeted professional development through coaching, mentoring, peer-to-peer support, inter-visitations, etc.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Teachers are recruited from various sources: 

1. New York City Department of Education Open Market Transfer (OMT) System 

2. New York City Department of Education New Teacher Finder (NTF) 

3. Local colleges and universities 

4. Student teachers 

Teachers are provided with mentoring according to the requirements of the NYCDOE. Additionally, new teachers are 
paired with more experienced teachers who provide support. Subject-area supervisors provide support and guidance 
for new teachers to ensure that they adjust well to teaching. 

 

The Basic Educational Data Survey (BEDS) completed in June 2015 identifies over 95% of our teachers as being highly 
qualified. One (1) Naval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (NJROTC) instructor is not considered highly qualified 
because New York State does not issue a permanent certification in NJROTC instruction. Although the BEDS survey 
lists 4 language teachers as not highly qualified, those teachers are delivering the majority of instruction in licensed 
areas in which they are highly qualified. We are actively seeking out licensed Spanish teachers from all local colleges 
and universities. The Assistant Principal Foreign Languages/ESL and the Assistant Principal Administration attend 
hiring fairs to recruit licensed Spanish teachers. The Assistant Principal Administration continually searches the open 
market hiring system for highly qualified teachers in all subject areas. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).

Common daily preparation periods are built into teacher schedules in English, mathematics, science, and social 
studies. Collaborative team meetings help to ensure the implementation of rigorous curricula aligned to the Common 
Core Learning Standards. Weekly professional development on Wednesday morning and daily common professional 
periods give teachers opportunities for cross-grade conversations, curricula development and lesson planning. Faculty 
and staff attend professional learning opportunities provided by the Superintendent's team, the Borough Field 
Support Center team, and the NYCODE central team to build the capacity of all staff to deliver rigorous and engaging 
curriculum to support student achievement.

multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teachers participate in the Measures of Student Learning (MOSL) committee to select the assessments that are used 
in the Advance teacher development and evaluation system. A review of the options for MOSL selections available for 
high school teachers in each content area is completed by the MOSL committee to build a culture of collective 
responsibility for the outcomes of all students. Even though the State measures are the principal’s decision, the 
principal involves teachers in the selection process to ensure that teachers understand the process and feel that their 
voices are heard. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Curtis High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 
The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children and by sharing information with them regularly. Parents are encouraged to 
actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Teacher Association, and Title I Parent Committee as 
trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community to support effective parental involvement and 
student achievement for all families.  

Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms (of parents and students) will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the 
needs of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Curtis High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:

outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 

other members of the school community. 

  

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on 
the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to consult their members for additional input. To increase 
and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 

school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 

implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are 

allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 

Parent-Teacher Association and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and 

ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 

families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 

assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 

environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 

events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 

accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 

support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality 

Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
The community school strategy organizes the resources and assets of the school and the community to establish a 
path to student success. The strengths of the school and community are leveraged to address potential barriers to 
student academic success, including, but not limited to, physical health, mental health, poverty, etc. The community 
school strategy complements and strengthens academic instruction leading to improved academic outcomes 
including course pass rates, Regents exam pass rates, and promotion rates.  

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
The goals of the Community School are aligned with the following CEP goals: 

1) By June 2019, the percentage of students accumulating 10+ Credits in their 1st Year (Cohort X) will increase by a 
minimum of 6.0% as measured by the School Quality Guide metric for Credit Accumulation. 

2) By June 2019, the percentage of All Students with 90%+ Attendance will increase by a minimum of 4.0% as 
measured by the School Quality Guide Supportive Environment metric. 

3) By June 2019, a professional development plan will be implemented with an emphasis on building teacher capacity 
in Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques and Demonstrating Knowledge of Students resulting in a minimum 
increase of 0.2 in the average rating across all observations of 3b: Using Questioning and Discussion Technique as 
measured by Advance reports. 

4) By June 2019, the percentage of accurate contact information for parents/guardians of all students will exceed 80% 
as measured by Blackboard Master reports. 

5) By June 2019, Family and Community Ties will be strengthened to a minimum score of 3.00 as measured by the 
Strong Family-Community Ties metric on the School Quality Guide. 

 

In addition, the following goals will further support school priorities for SY 2018-19: 

6) By June 2019, the percentage of 1st Year (Cohort X) students who are chronically absent will be reduced by a 
minimum of 5% as measured by daily attendance records. 

7) By June 2019, school staff will work collaboratively with School Based Health Center (SBHC) staff and each of our 
community school partners to reach a minimum SBHC enrollment rate of 75% as measured by enrollment reports. 

8) By January 2020, the Postsecondary Enrollment Rate of students in Cohort U will increase by a minimum of 5% as 
measured by the School Quality Guide. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

9) By June 2019, a minimum of 80% of all students will have completed vision screening at Curtis High School. 

 

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students? 
Achieving our Community School Goals will help provide a clear path to academic success and postsecondary (college 
and career) preparedness by providing universal, selective, and targeted interventions and resources that address 
potential barriers to the academic, social-emotional, and personal growth of students.

o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.

The English Language Learner (ELL) population at Curtis High School needs support in both the 
academic and socio-emotional settings. In order to successfully integrate these students into the 
English academic mainstream and prepare them for college and career success we have created 
several programs and classes designed to foster learning English for authentic purposes in both 
the social and academic arenas. These programs are designed for all English Language 
Learners/Student with Disabilities (SWD) students in grades 9-12, including newcomers, 
Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE), and Long Term Absence (LTA) students. 
Some of the supplemental programs we will create after school  are: 
1- An English Language Arts (ELA), NYSESLAT enrichment and remediation class will take 
place after school, at 3:45-5:15 on Mondays, and at 3:05- 4:35 on Wednesdays beginning 
September, 2018 and ending June, 2019. The focus of our enrichment activities are three-fold: a) 
improving the students' critical reading capabilities by developing close reading/annotation 
strategies; b) improving the students' writing by developing  assignments that bridge the gap 
between high school and college and c) increasing our students' Tier II and Tier III vocabulary 
awareness. d) increasing the NYSESLAT scores by one level for all students. The NYSESLAT 
scores from May, 2017 showed an increase of 7.9% from the May, 2016 scores (6%). The total 
number of students that scored Commanding was 7.9% compared to 10.6% from th the previous 
year. Although not all students scored Commanding, many of them improved their scores within 
the same proficiency level. The number of students that took the NYSESLAT in May, 2017 was 
178. Eleven students scored Expanding, lower than last year's number. That was a considerable 
decrease from the previous year.  However, 14 students scored Commanding (7.9%) last year. 
That was a considerable increase from the previous year. The Supplemental Program we have 
after school has definitely increased the number of students' proficiency from one year to the 
next.  Instruction will be delivered by a certified English as a New Language (ENL) teacher and 
a certified English teacher. The class will be team taught by both the licensed ELA teacher and 
the licensed ENL teacher. Home language support will also be incorporated into the daily 
lessons.  Based on data from past Regents examinations , the NYSESLAT, and in-school 
assessments, instruction will be aligned to the Common Core standards and incorporate best 
practices as prescribed in Danielson's Framework for Teaching. Differentiated instruction and 
accountable talk will be incorporated as part of the daily lessons.  The targeted population 
consists of English Language Learners, grades 11 and 12, including SWDs and LTAs.  Classes 
will continue through June, 2019. Classes will meet Mondays and Wednesdays from 3:45 PM to 
4:45 PM.  The program will begin as soon as the money becomes available and will end in June, 
2019. The total number of sessions will be 112 if the money is available by October 17, 2018. 
Materials will be supplemental and distinct from the materials used in class. The students and the 
teachers will be using a variety of materials such as; "Academic Vocabulary Toolkit 1" by Kate 
Kinsella; publisher Cenage Learning, "Focus on Learning 1, Bridging Vocabulary", the publisher

is Pearson-Longman, and "Close Reading Notebook" also published by Pearson-
Longman.   Classes will be created on Skedula. Teachers will keep records of attendance, student 
scores and program notifications to parents in Spanish and other home language that are 
represented by the students. 
 
2- A support class for newcomers will continue for the school year 2018-2019, after school, at 
3:45-4:45 on Tuesdays and Thursdays beginning September, 2018 and ending June, 2019.  Since 
we have a large number of newcomers this year again, the class will be taught by a 
licensed  bilingual teacher and a licensed English and ENL teacher. The teachers will address 
any socio- emotional problems students have encountered in their new environment, whether it is 
at home and/or in school. Some of the International Baccalaureate Program students will attend 
the support class in order to help the newcomers and to welcome them into Curtis H.S. and to 
make a difference in how they feel about being in a new country. They will also be there for 
any content area support.  The teacher will also offer enrichment activities such as using the 
Hochman writing program across the content areas, and discuss team building and extra-
curricular activities that are offered in the school. This past year 2017-2018, the techers planned 
many activities after school and during the school day. They went to the 9/11 memorial, the 
Statue of Liberty, and the local library. During the year, the ELL Guidance Counselor, in 
conjunction with the licensed Bilingual/ENL certified teachers, will come in once a month to talk 
to students about issues they may encounter such as legal status, pathways to higher education, 
and opportunities they have even if they are undocumented, as provided by the Dream Act and 
ASAP. They will also discuss the requirements for graduation in New York State, classes they 
are mandated to take, i.e. ENL and Home Language Arts (HLA) classes, explain the mandated 
NYSESLAT exam and how their scores determine the number of ENL classes and whether they 
will be placed in the TBE Program based on their NYSITELL scores and the Home Language 
Survey when they first come into school.  The guidance counselor is a native speaker of Spanish 
as well and will be able clarify or explain the mandates required in the United States, specifically 
New York State. 
 
3- An enrichment Algebra class will take place after school, at 4:50-5:35, Monday to Thursday 
beginning in September, 2018 and ending June, 2019. Instruction will be in a bilingual setting, 
Spanish will be the language of instruction, taught by a certified Math teacher, in conjunction 
with a licensed bilingual teacher. The class will include 10th, 11th, and 12th grade ELLs that did 
not pass their Regents exam, including SWDs and LTAs, and utilize innovative technology such 
as the rapid response interactive student assessment system and students personal Chromebooks, 
which are available in the classroom for daily use. 
 
 
Curtis High School currently employs four certified ENL teachers and two certified bilingual 
teachers.   The ELA/NYSESLAT enrichment and remediation class will be taught in English 
using ENL methodology, with home language support. The language of instruction for the 
Algebra class will be a bilingual class setting, (Spanish-English). Finally, the support class for 
the newcomers will be taught in Spanish and English for any ELL student that wishes to attend. 
This year the Newcomers Club grew immensely. The number of students who joined the Club 
increased by 50%. Not only did the Spanish speaking students attend but our next big ELL 
population, Arabic speaking students also came on a regular basis.  
 
Materials teachers will use are textbooks in English for the ELA/NYSESLAT class as well as 
additional reading materials such as short stories, novels, essays, informational articles, etc., that 
align with the Common Core standards. In the Algebra class the teacher will use the bilingual 
Algebra textbook that aligns with the new Common Core exam in Math. Students will also use

the on-line workbook that is aligned with the textbook.  Since Curtis HS has instituted a chrome 
book  initiative beginning with the International Baccalaureate and SIS programs, we have 
extended the initiative by providing chrome books for all ELL students out of the Title III grant. 
This year 2017-2018 we ordered 40 mini iPads for the Ells in their Living Environment and 
Earth Science classes and English classes. These were bought with the Title III money. Achieve 
3000 was ordered this year for our ELLs and the program is available for them during the 
summer.  In addition, supplies that the teachers and the students will use that we need funded out 
of the Title III grant are supplemental materials such as large post-it paper, markers, pens and 
pencils, and stick-it note pads.

Professional Development (PD) for the Title III Supplemental Program is designed to improve 
instruction for our ELL students, including the SWD and LTA students, to increase credit 
accumulation, increase the Regents exam pass rate, and to increase the NYSESLAT scores by at 
least one level. We have Professional Developments because Title III teachers need support, 
therefore, Curtis High School's Professional Development for the Title III   Supplemental 
Program is as follows: 
1- Curtis High School's Professional Development day is every Wednesday morning from 7:45-
8:45. Teachers of ELLs, including ENL/HLA teachers and all content-area teachers of ELLs, 
will attend the scheduled in-house professional development. The PDs are held through June, 
2019. The tentative dates for the Professional Development are, September 19, 2018,  October 
17, 2018, November 22, 2018, and December 19, 2018.  We will also have four Small Learning 
Community meeting in the spring, 2018 semester. The meetings will take place once a month, on 
Wednesdays. We will have a total of four meetings per semester, which will be an average of 
eight meetings a year. We also will meet on the Chancellor's Conference Days Days, November 
7, 2018 . Each of our meetings will be an hour in length. The meetings we have during the 
Chancellor's Conference Days will be 90 minutes in length.  Of course, this component will be at 
no cost to the program. The ELL guidance counselor will also attend the meetings to help 
teachers understand and learn how to deal with certain issues that the ELL population faces. 
Topics that will be covered are differentiating instruction in the ENL, HLA, and content area 
classes and incorporating vocabulary-building activities into instruction on a daily basis. 
"Scaffolding Instructions for ELLs", a new resource, provided by Engage NY, for literacy and 
mathematics will be studied and the instructional strategies will be incorporated into the English 
and Mathematics classes. The instructional strategies are aligned with the Common Core 
standards. The instructional strategies will also be used in the ELA/NYSESLAT remediation/ 
enrichment class and in the Algebra class.  Lesson study groups will discuss and create unit plans 
and align lessons to the Common Core standards.  Working closely with the English Department 
we will incorporate a structured writing initiative, such as the Hochmann Writing Program, in the 
ENL classes. The ENL teachers will facilitate some professional development Wednesdays on

how to incorporate ENL methodologies, such as scaffolding strategies, to content-area 
teachers.  The teachers that provide the PDs will be recommended to receive PDs from outside 
the building such as those offered by the District office and the ones offered by the Field Support 
Team. Agendas and Sign-In sheets are available every Wednesday mornings. They are kept on 
file in a binder, in a cabinet that is exclusive of the Assistant Principal. Minutes are then recorded 
and sent to the Principal.

  name of provider 
  how parents will be notified of these activities 

Begin description here:            
  
Parents of ELLs are invited to various activities and meetings throughout the school year. We 
believe that the more parents are involved in their children's  lives, the better their children will 
perform in school. The Assistant Principal has Agendas, Sign-In sheets and records, including 
minutes in a binder and are kept in a locked file cabinet in her office. The invitations and 
brochures we send to the families are in multiple languages and they are also kept in a file 
cabinet.  
1- Every year, before the holiday season, the PTA organizes an International Celebration. Parents 
of ELLs are invited to bring a specific food that represents their countries. Parents are invited to 
attend the celebration via telephone calls in their native language; notifications are also sent 
home in English and in their own language. Many parents and students attend the celebration. 
 
Topic 1: International Celebration 
Rationale: Increasing parental involvement by celebrating the many cultures at Curtis HS 
Date: December, 2018 
Time: 7:00 PM- 9:00 PM 
Name of Provider: Curtis HS Foreign Language/ENL Department 
Audience: students, teachers and parents 
 
2- The Multi-Cultural Club at Curtis H.S. is a melting pot of the many different cultures 
represented by our student body. The club organizes a Multi-Cultural event every year. Students 
perform dances and/or sing songs that are representative of their countries; after the 
performances refreshments are served. Parents are invited and again letters are sent home in 
English and in their native languages.  Telephone calls are made in the various languages and 
announcements are made in the Curtis Parent Newsletter, a monthly that is mailed to the 
families. Many parents attend the event and refreshments are served afterwards. 
 
Topic 2: Multi-Cultural Celebration of the Arts 
Rationale: to heighten awareness of the arts and culture of our many different ethnic groups 
represented at Curtis HS 
Date: May, 2019

Name of Provider: the Multi-Cultural Club 
Audience: student body and faculty 
 
 
3- The ENL Guidance Counselor and the Parent Coordinator advise parents of any Community 
Board Organizations or agencies that may meet their needs. A representative of El Centro del 
Emigrante, a non-profit organization, comes to Curtis H.S. to speak to parents of ELLs about the 
many issues with which they are faced. Some of the issues they discuss are immigration, jobs, 
college, their rights as immigrants, etc. Curtis HS also purchased FM transmitters and receivers 
called "Talk and Listen" kits.

Name of Provider: El Centro del Emigrante 
Audience: Parents/guardians of our ELL students 
 
4- Curtis H.S. has strong ties with the New York Immigration Coalition and the Mexican 
Consulate. With the help of these organizations and the cooperation of the Mexican Consulate, 
we host an adult education program based on the Consulate's Plaza Comunitaria model. Plaza 
brings a ready-made, technology rich menu such as Native Language pre-General Education 
Diploma (GED), GED, civics, cultural enrichment, and job training as well as a strong ELL 
component and native language workshops. We offer free English and computer literacy classes 
to the parents. The classes are held every Thursday, from 7:00 P.M.-9:00P.M. in the school 
library. 
El Centro del Emigrante offers parents free clothing and free food. This school year, 2017-2018 
Curtis H.S. offered free cooking classes every Wednesday evening, from 6:00-8:00 P.M. Parents 
who attend are given hands on cooking classes and after the classes are over every Wednesday, 
parents take home food from our food pantry.  Parents are also informed of the Translation and 
Interpretation services via the New York City Translation and Interpretation Unit. The Language 
Assessment Kit by the New York City Department of Education is used at Curtis H.S. as well.

5- We will schedule two award days for our ELLs attending the after school program. Parents 
will be invited to attend the ceremony to honor the students with the best attendance, most 
improved grades, and the highest average. The ceremonies will take place twice during the 
course of the year, once during the mid-year mark of their classes and the second ceremony will 
take place in June. Parents will be invited via telephone calls, letters will be sent home, and 
announcements in the parent newsletter. All communication with families will be in English and 
in their home language. This year the celebration was held in Room 440 and it was a great 
success. Many students attended, as well as some parents. The two teachers that were the 
coordinators of the after school Newcomers Club presented the certificates to the students. 
Students and staff brought in home made food from their country. This event really had a 
positive impact on our ELLs.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The assessment tools Curtis High School uses to measure early literacy skills are the AGS Reading Level Indicator, Empower 
reading program, in-class reading comprehension assessment, Academic Language and Literacy Diagnostic (ALLD), and 
portfolio writing assignments.  These assessments provide us with the basic reading level of each student as well as their 
writing abilities. It also provides us with word recognition skills of each student.  The reading comprehension assessments 
provide us with an indication of what skills the students need to develop, such as inferencing and visualization. The ELA scores 
provide us with an indication of the students’ listening, reading, and writing skills. The information we gather from the 
students’ test results helps us determine how instruction will be delivered and what we have to focus on in order to help the 
students progress to the next level. Based on the data, ELL students do poorly in the reading assessments, specifically the 
comprehension part. They also do poorly in the listening part of the test. When Formative Assessments are incorporated in the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

classroom practice, it provides the information needed to adjust teaching and learning while it is happening. Teachers' lessons 
are focused on reading and listening activities in order to help students improve their listening and reading skills. Curtis HS also 
purchased the web based Literacy program "Empower" for additional support.Formative assessments inform both teachers 
and students understanding at a point when timely adjustments can be made. This allows for student involvement about their 
own work. USing formative assessments allows students to be accountable for their work, therefore , if students are very 
aware of the formative assessments, they will become more involved.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

After careful review of EDAT teachers focus on whatever skills students need in order to improve one or more of the four 
modalities; reading, writing, speaking, and listening. The structures we have in place at the present time are teacher-created 
assessments and an on-line literacy program "Empower". Teachers are required to give "exit slips" before the end of each class 
to formatively assess their students' progress.Teachers also visit colleagues' classes to observe and integrate new strategies in 
their own class rooms. Students self assess and reflect  on their learning through a classroom rubric, on a daily basis.  This 
allows the teacher to see the students' perspective of their learning.  The data from the Regents, the uniform mid-term exams, 
and the uniform final exam inform us of how to plan and deliver instruction. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
  We evaluate the success of our programs by looking closely at our data and making decisions based on attendance rate, 
graduation rate, Regents exams, NYSESLAT results, and the ELA regents as well as anecdotal teacher evaluations.  The Inquiry 
Team meets twice a month after school to review this information;  we also meet every Wednesday morning for one hour for 
our weekly Professional Development with the ELL content-area teachers, the ELL guidance counselor and the assistant 
principal to evaluate student performance in the content-area classes, ENL classes, the Home Language Arts classes, and the 
bilingual Global History classes.  Additional tutoring opportunities as well as an ELA class Regents class created for 11th and 
12th grade ELLs  are planned in order to give students the opportunity to fulfill graduation requirements and to come closer to 
Commanding in the NYSESLAT, as well as passing the ELA Regents. We also created an after school, after period 10 at 3:35 until 
4:15 in room 436.  Socio-emotional support is also discussed; we have implemented an after school support class for all ELL 
students who need socio-emotional support. Additionally all staff involved with the ELL population discusses  the need to help 
develop the program for the ELL students for the next semester.  Students are encouraged and welcomed to come to the 
Assistant Principal’s office during their free periods or lunch periods to discuss any problems or issues they may have.  Each ELL 
student’s program is examined on an individual basis and is tailor-made to meet his/her individual needs.  This year our 
projected graduation rate for ELLs is 82%.  A conference with each student is scheduled with the guidance counselor; report 
card grades as well as attendance records for each subject area are reviewed as well as any remedial class attendance. Each 
student is then asked to focus on any specific problem, and set their own personal goals to perform better in the areas that 
they feel are most important.  As goals are met the student sets new goals.  Students are encouraged to reflect on his/her 
academic progress on a weekly basis and chart that progress, which is then periodically monitored by the guidance counselor 
to ensure that the student stays on task and continues to grow academically and emotionally.  Parents are aware of the 
support we give their children.  If a parent comes to us with a problem or if we become aware of a problem we meet with the 
parent and refer the child and the parent to a school based psychologist.  Additional counseling services are also available 
through our Community Health Center located in our school which has a Spanish speaking psychologist.  The student  with the 
parents’ permission attends counseling sessions. For the Spanish speaking students and parents there is a Spanish speaking 
social worker who attends the initial meeting and subsequently meets with the student. Progress is measured using teacher 
generated tests and Regents from past years. We also use uniform mid-term exams and uniform final exams. At the end of 
each marking period we also assess students in all content areas, including Mathematics. Students progress are identified by 
using the results of the NYSESLAT and for students new to the country and school, we use the results of the Spanish LAB or the 
NYSITEL. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Summative assessment data is used to provide feedback to students and inform parents. The course goals are measured by 
the results of the summative assessments, and new course goals are set for the following year.  The assistant principal targets 
students struggling with graduation requirements and with colleges that help students establish themselves with the local 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

college. We provide after school tutoring four days a week, from 3:40 PM to 4:40 PM. Saturday classes are available for 
tutoring from 9:00 AM- 12:00 PM. We also have peer tutoring between the International Baccalaureate  students and the ELL 
students that need help in content areas.  Students know that the ENL/Foreign Language office is always available to them, 
whether they have issues with academics, social, or emotional issues. The office is always open to them to speak with the 
assistant principal or one of the HLA teachers whom have had similar backgrounds. Finally, we also work closely with the 
Community Health Center when there are serious issues that need to be addressed immediately. The social worker is also a 
Spanish speaker who sees many of our students. Students are encouraged to attend after school tutoring which takes place 
from Monday through Thursday. We Also offer Math and English tutoring on Saturday morning from 9:00AM to 12:00PM.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 N/A    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Based on the information on the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) 139 students were tested, 16 (11.5%) scored Commanding. 
Twenty students that took the NYSESLAT scored expanding and scored 3 or 4 on the ELA with 65% or greater.  The number of 
NYSESLAT takers that advanced 1 profiency lever was 44; 17 students advanced 2 proficiency levels and 1 student advanced 3 
proficiency levels.  Unfortunately three students regressed 1 proficiency level. Forty four students who took the 
NYSESLAT remained at the same proficiency level as the previous year.  Data shows that 9th graders scored highest in the 
Speaking modality, the writing , and the listening modality. Seven students scored at or below the 25th percentile growth and 
scored at level 1 or 2 on the ELA. There were five students who scored at or below the 25th percentile  and scored 1 or 2 on 
the Math.  According to the EDAT, students' needs are as follows; 9th grades did the poorest in writing ( 15 students ), 10th 
graders also scored low in writing, 20 students in all.  The academic interventions we have in place are as follows; mentoring 
programs with peer students, language support in the bilingual content area classes.  HLA classes to support the students' 
home language, English classes with ENL support in a team taught environment.  
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We program our ELL students accordingly, based on the data results of the NYSESLAT, ELA, EDAT, Spanish LAB, 
NYSITEL.Students who scored 1 or 2 in math or ELA are offered tutoring three days a week; Tuesday, Wednesday, and 
Thursday in room 436. We also offer a English class for students in the 11th and 12th grades that did not pass the English 
Regents or scored low. The class is part of their programs and it meets five days a week, period 10 in room 236. Saturday 
school is also offered to the students that need extra tutoring. The classes start at 9:00 AM till 12:00 PM. They are able to 
attend both Math and English classes. Members of the ENL Department meet twice a month to discuss the students' 
assessments and we discuss what the next steps will be for the students. We also discuss their socio-economic development 
and the guidance counselor further investigates the students' situation.  
The school's leadership committee is comprised of the assistant principal, teachers of ELLs, the guidance counselor of ELLs, and 
parents who are part of the school leadership committee. The team meets twice a semester to discuss the needs of our ELL 
students.  The parents of the school leadership is well aware at these meetings that the staff is implementing the structures of 
the ELLs' needs. It is during this time that the assistant principal distributes the results of the NYSESLAT and a teacher of ENL is 
present as well and assures the team that every teacher has received a copy of the students' NYSESLAT results. At the end of 
each semester and when the State test scores are available, the assistant principal of the Foreign Language/ENL department 
invites members of the school leadership and the the assistant principals to analyze the ELL scores on the NYS exams. The 
specific questions that are analysed by the team are questions related to comprehension, in both English and Spanish, 
vocabulary used in the questions and the students' understanding of the vocabulary.  We also discuss what programs we can 
provide for the students that did not pass the NYS exams. We also analyse the results of the NYSITEL to determine the 
students' strengths and weaknesses in order for teachers to adjust their lessons.  Students work will be reviewed at the end of 
each marking period to determine if the student work has improved based on the data we reviewed, especially the specific 
questions that students did not do well in. Every semester Curtis HS conducts a PASS review. This committee consists of 
members of the School Leadership team, school members of the SLC. The PASS review allows the members of the school 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72 

 

 

leadership team, parents to be accompanied by the staff members of the committee and various groups are organized and 
observe different aspects of the school, including the classrooms.  After accessing ATS scores and we meet with the school 
leadership team, lessons are differentiated based on their academic needs. We continuously review student work and progress 
at Curtis HS. Our focus is to offer our ELLs quality school work and we want to ensure that they are getting the best education 
possible. We review their work and progress and differentiate lessons, offer tutoring, including adjustments made to their 
programs.  We try to always meet the needs of the students based on their learning gaps, which are revealed in the data we 
analyse. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

        Instruction is organized departmentally.  ELL students receive the mandated ENL classes through the ENL/Foreign 
Language Department.   ELL students are fully integrated in the school's Small Learning Communities, taking elective 
classes according to their expressed interests.  All classes are taught by NYS licensed teachers.  ENL classes are 
organized homogeneously based on proficiency level established by NYSITEL, Spanish LAB or NYSESLAT results as per 
CR Part 154.2. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

     Instruction is organized departmentally.  ELL students receive the mandated ENL classes through the ENL/Foreign 
Language Department.  Subject-specific ENL and bilingual language classes are offered in Mathematics, Social Studies 
and Science.  ELL students are fully integrated in the school's Small Learning Communities, taking elective classes 
according to their expressed interests.  All classes are taught by NYS licensed teachers.  ELL classes are organized 
homogeneously based on proficiency level established by NYSITEL, Spanish LAB, and the ELE,  NYSESLAT 
results.   Students in the TBE classes take  teacher-created assessments and the ELE scores. There are levels of 
HLA classes; Beginning, Intermediate, and Advanced. These classes are offered five days a week and they are 
integrated into the students' programs. Heritage speakers are not placed in the TBE Program, they are placed in the 
ENL classes and Spanish classes we offer to our American students. 
 
Transitional Bilingual Education Program: 
     (1)  Entering - 360 minutes of ENL, 180 minutes of ENL/ELA instruction, 1 HLA class and 2 bilingual content area 
classes weekly 
     (2)  Emerging - 180 minutes of ENL instruction, 180 minutes of ENL/ELA instruction, 1 HLA class and 2 bilingual

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

             Based on the results of the LAB and Spanish LAB and NYSESLAT, students are placed in the appropriate level of 
instruction for the mandated number of minutes, in the program chosen.  All classes are taught by NYS licensed 
teachers.  Consistent with CR Part 154, students receive the following mandated minutes of instruction depending on ENL 
level: 
ENL and ELA: 
     (1)  Entering - 360 minutes of ENL instruction and 180 minutes of ENL/ELA weekly 
     (2)  Emerging - 360 minutes of ENL instruction 
     (3)  Transitioning - 180 minutes of ENL instruction 
     (4) Expanding - 180 minutes of ENL instruction 
     (5) Commanding - 90 minutes of intergrated ENL in ELA or content area weekly 
When possible and deemed to be in the student's best academic interest, students are offered additional ELA instruction as 
per responses to intervention (RTI) to ensure that the student will perform well on the NYS ELA regents and the NYSESLAT, 
while meeting standards for college readiness.   
Transitional Bilingual Education Program: 
     (1)  Entering - 360 minutes of ENL, 180 minutes of ENL/ELA instruction, 1 HLA class and 2 bilingual content area classes 
weekly 
     (2)  Emerging - 180 minutes of ENL instruction, 180 minutes of ENL/ELA instruction, 1 HLA class and 2 bilingual content area 
classes weekly 
     (3)  Transitioning - 90 minutes of ENL, 90 minutes of ENL/ELA instruction, 1 HLA class and 1 bilingual content area classes 
weekly                           
     (4) Expanding - 180 minutes of ENL/ELA instruction,1 HLA class and 1 bilingual content area classes weekly  
     (5) Commanding - 90 minutes of integrated ENL in ELA  
When possible and deemed to be in the student's best academic interest, students are offered additional ELA responses to 
intervention (RTI) to ensure that the student will perform well on the NYS ELA regents and the NYSESLAT, while meeting 
standards for college readiness.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
    Both Entering and Emerging ENL students have 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week in Global History, Earth Science, or 
Biology and Algebra 1 and 180 minutes of ENL/ELA instruction.  In these classes the self-contained model is observed.  The ELLs 
are grouped together and receive content area instruction with ENL methodologies in English with Home Language support 
and instruction is aligned with the New York State Common Core Standards. The home language support is also available at 
Curtis H.S, because the Bilingual/ENL certified teacher and coach visits the content area classes on a rotating schedule to 
provide home language support. The licensed ENL teacher  also meets with content area teachers during professional 
development sessions. Both Ms. Kelly and Mr. Davis meet with various content area teachers after school to discuss the 
support and specific topics to help teachers and students. Content area class rooms are provided with Home Language 
libraries, bilingual dictionaries and textbooks that are ENL specific for each content area. Most content-area teachers have 
been sent to workshops dedicated to the instruction of ELL students. These teachers also regularly attend both in house PD 
and PD offered outside of the school building during the school year by the Department of English Language Learners and the 
workshops offered by the Borough Field Support Office. We offer two Global classes where instruction delivery is as stated 
above.  
        Expanding and Commanding ENL classes are mainstreamed in most content area classes.  ENL content area classes in both 
American History and Economics are offered to the  ENL students, in order to enable the ELLs to pass the American History and 
Government Regents exam. Expanding students have 180 minutes of ENL/ELA instruction, one HLA class (for those students in 
the TBE program), and one bilingual content area class weekly. Students in th ENL program have 180 minutes of ENL 
instruction.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74 

 

 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Since the majority of ELLs are Spanish speakers, we first give them an oral exam followed by a teacher-created literacy 
test,  where the students are tested in Spanish. Based on the results of the diagnostic test the students are placed in a  Home 
Language Arts class and a bilingual class.  This year we have over one hundred students enrolled in the Transitional Bilingual 
Program.  Students are evaluated in the classroom via formative assessments, student portfolios, and the ELE test 
scores.  Teachers align instruction with the Common Core Standards for the Home Language Arts curriculum      
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Curtis HS offers Students with Interrupted Formal Education the tutoring classes that take place after school, from 3:35-
4:30.  These students are students who attended school in their country. They are also students who attended school in this 
country, returned to their country for a period of time and then returned to the US again. SIFE students are also students that 
attended Kindergarten in English (L2), attended 1st and 2nd grade in their country. Differentiation is a way for teachers to alter 
their instructional strategies to help students with mixed abilities and learning styles as well as level of understanding reach 
their academic potential. The teachers at Curtis give the SIFE and Newcomer students supplemental material in order to grasp, 
for example the vocabulary and ideas that were taught. For the Developing students and long term, and former ELLs more 
complex material is given to the assignments. Students who need to pass the ELA and/or Algebra are given the English prep 
class during PERIOD 10. SInce some students also need an a prep class for Algebra, they attend Saturday school for the Algebra 
class.  SIFE students also attend English and Math classes on Saturdays from 9:00 AM- 12:00 PM.  Students are scheduled 
during their regular school hours for an Algebra 1 and Intergrated Algebra support class as well as a Literacy support class. The 
"Newcomers' Club, a regularly scheduled socio-emotional support class, was also scheduled to meet on Tuesdays and 
Thursdays for one hour, from 3:45-4:45; during this class a Spanish-speaking Guidance Counselor addressed such topics as 
college readiness, rights of the students when it comes time to apply for college, and other related topics of interest to 
ELLs.   At the beginning of the fall semester 2017 , ELLs were given the NYSED Oral Questionnaire for SIFE students,  then a 
diagnostic reading test is administered in order to establish their reading ability (ALLD).  The ENL students use a Web based 
literacy program, called Empower, in order to improve their literacy skills.  All students selected for this class are mandated to 
attend the  Literacy class during their regular school day, Monday through Friday. Licensed ENL teaches were trained in the 
Empower program. Tutoring is also available Monday-Friday, periods 10 and 11.  An ENL licensed teacher, is in charge of the 
literacy class and tutoring.  Students that have been identified as SIFE/SWD students are enrolled in one of the Home Language 
Arts class. They are also enrolled in the Algebra classes. 
        Curtis High School will continue to expand our Transitional Bilingual Program for the school year 2017-2018.  We will 
expand the program to the Science Department by adding a bilingual Earth science class.  As of this moment, however, we 
have purchased the Visual Learning DVDs for Living Environment and Earth Science.  "The Newcomers' Club", a Guidance class 
for academic and social-emotional support, will also be added during the expanded day high school hours, 5:45-6:45, Monday-
Thursday. "The Newcomer's Club" will again be conducted by a Spanish-speaking College and Career guidance counselor and a 
Spanish speaking Spanish teacher.  In addition, CHS will continue to implement the Literacy class for those students who 
qualify to attend.  The Empower web based literacy program will be used as well for Entering and Emerging ENL students 
during their regular school day.  SIFE/SWD students will also be scheduled to attend a team-taught literacy class with a 
Reading Specialist during their  regular school day and/or a team-taught Math skill-building class, according to the students' 
needs. 
    b)     For ELLs who are newcomers (are in the US less than three years) instruction will be delivered using ENL strategies 
and instruction.  ENL and content area teachers have attended training offered by DELLS and PD offered by BFST. The 
classrooms are supplied with bilingual dictionaries and home language libraries. Students are programmed for a literacy class 
in addition to their required ENL classes.  Based on the Parent Choice letters we also program these students in a Transitional 
Bilingual Program. At present we have three Home Language Arts classes, two Global classes, and two Algebra classes. 
Tutoring is offered to these students as well after school, periods 10 and 11in the content area and in ENL. ELA tutoring is also 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75 

 

available on Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. For these students we also offer Empower, which is used in the students' 
regular school day program. During the regular school day an ELA review class will be scheduled and team taught by an English 
teacher and a licensed ENL teacher. 
d)  At present Curtis High School has 38 Long-Term ELLS (6+ years).  The ENL guidance counselor of Curtis High School 
continues to monitor the progress of the students by recommending placement into the Home Language Arts classes for 
Spanish speaking students, a class where the Empower literacy program is used daily and a literacy class.  Empower is 
presently used in three of the ENL literacy classes. If the SIFE grant is awarded this school year Empower will be purchased and 
used in the ESL and Literacy classes in order to increase the students' literacy skills. A class targeted for these students is in 
place specifically for the ELA instruction during periods 10, Monday through Friday. This class is scheduled during the students' 
regular school day. The class will be team taught with a licensed English teacher and a certified teacher of ENL.  In addition, the 
ELLs go to tutoring and attend review classes offered during Saturday School in order to build their literacy skills. Based on the 
literacy skills in their home language, they will be placed in the Home Language Arts class which meets five periods every day, 
Monday to Friday. This year  four Home Language Arts classes will meet periods 2,3, 5, 7, and 9. A mentoring program for 
these students is being planned as well as support group which will meet every morning during period 1. The group will be 
monitored by a teacher who has experience with ELLs and is an AVID-trained teacher/mentor here at Curtis H.S. 
 e) Former ELLs, those that scored Expanding and Commanding are mandated to ENL services for two years.  We ask these 
students if they want to remain in the "L" House and take classes offered by one of our other small learning communities, or if 
they want to be in one of the other seven Small Learning Communities of their choice.  We explain to them that if they choose 
to go into another specialty houses they are still must attend 90 minute classes of ENL or a content area/ENL class. The 
majority of students opt to stay in the "L" House, although they take additional courses offered in the other 
houses.   Commanding students are scheduled for a support class that meets twice a week. Expanding students who passed 
the ELA also are scheduled for the support class. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
  Students identified as ELLs/SWD who are required to have ESL services are monitored by the Instructional Services 
Department as per protocols established to write annual goals through Annual Review Conferences.  At these yearly meetings 
parents, students, teachers (Special Education and General Education) and a compliance coordinator review how the students 
are performing academically in all subject areas including ENL.  Once every three years, the School Assessment Team (School 
Psychologist and Social Worker) evaluates each student in Special Education in preparation for a new IEP.  Recommendations 
as to future ESL services are made at this meeting. 
ELLs who do not come to Curtis High School with an IEP and have difficulties in the ENL and ENL content area classes are 
evaluated by the subject teachers, a Special Education teacher as well as the Assistant Principal of Pupil Personnel Department 
for possible placement into Special Education. However, this procedure is not done for at least one year after the student has 
been attending Curtis High School. The ENL teacher initiates the process of placing an ENL student into Special Education after 
observing the ENL student over a period of time.  The documentation includes notes on the student’s academic performance 
or behavioral problems in class in comparison to the other ELLs who are progressing well.  The teacher will send guidance 
referrals to the Assistant Principal of Pupil Personnel, who will begin the interview process for placement into Special 
Education. The instruction is delivered via the Stand Alone ENL class with native language support. The teacher, a licensed 
Special Education and Bilingual teacher, supports them in Spanish using WILSON methodology; materials used (i.e. books) are 
also available in the Home language.  ENL methodology and instructional strategies are employed.  Bilingual dictionaries are 
also used and kept in the class rooms. Students identified as having IEPs will be tested with modifications as indicated on their 
IEPs. Students with disabilities are provided the testing accomodations specified in their IEPs. Spanish-speaking students with 
IEPs will also be placed in the Home Language Arts class if the data indicates that their literacy skills in their native language 
are low.     
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
      Students identified as ELL/SWDs are placed in mainstream classes at Curtis H.S. in the content-area, except for the 
Home Language Arts classes, Math support class, and the Global1 class, and this year in the Earth science bilingual class. The 
curriculum  follows the New York State standards as well as the Common Core Standards across the disciplines. Instructionaly, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76 

 

teachers differentiate instruction based on the data we have gathered according to the Universal Design for Learning (UDL). 
Academic rigor and balanced literacy are evident in the classrooms. Students identified as ELL/SWD are placed in CTT classes in 
the content areas and are given Foreign Language and elective courses. The required courses that students take in order to 
satisfy graduation requirements are given to ELL/SWD students.  The required Regents exams that they need to take to qualify 
for an Advanced Regents Diploma are also administered to these students.  Students who are ELLs/SWD are programmed for 
all their classes with the rest of the mainstream population, except for their ENL and/or Home Language Arts classes.     
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 Intervention services for ELLs in ELA, Math, Science, Global History, English, and US History include, but are not limited to: 
•     After school tutoring: ELA, Math, Global History, U.S.History  
•     Literay support classes for SIFE students and Home Language Arts Classes (3 levels) 
•     Saturday tutoring-content area 
•    Empower support for literacy-SIFE students 
Most of the intervention services offered at Curtis High School are conducted in English and Spanish.  Classes in Math and 
History are conducted in English and Spanish as needed by the students. The Global 1 class is also conducted in both languages 
and the home language is used as needed by the students.  The Home Language Arts classes and the Algebra classes are 
conducted the same way as described above..  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 For the upcoming year we will re-create a literacy and NYSESLAT review class,  a “Club Connect” for socio-emotional support 
as well as a college and career readiness component.  The college office counselor, who is a native Spanish speaker, will push 
in two days a week to discuss such topics as resume writing, the college application process, the rights of undocumented 
young people and college, and the process and vital information about becoming a legal resident.  Budget permitting, more 
ENL licensed teachers will be hired in order to be in compliance with the new mandated New York State regulations. We will 
also expand our TBE Program.   We will also add an American History ENL class with a licensed History and ENL licenses. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Curtis High School will not discontinue any programs or services for the ELLs.    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 Tutoring for the ELA, Math, Social Studies, both Global and US History, and the Sciences (Living Environment, Chemistry, Earth 
Science) is available after school, Monday through Friday during 10th and 11th periods in the school library.  One of our 
licensed ENL/Bilingual certified teacher is also available  to help and support our students. Tutoring is offered on Saturdays for 
all content area classes. The classes begin at 9:00 a.m. and end at 12:00 p.m. A SIFE Literacy class will be offered as well during 
the students regular school day, Monday-Friday in Room 422. ELLS are offered equal access to programs such as the 
International Bacclaureate classes if students excel in their previous courses.  Students are placed in the IB classes if they show 
mastery in the subject area and a strong desire to be in the class.  Many ELLs at Curtis H.S. are placed in the IB Spanish, Italian, 
or French classes.  This is true for the other content area classes as well. ELLS are encouraged to participate in a Curtis H.S. 
after-school activity; many students play soccer and have been offered scholarships to colleges when they graduate. The 
peer tutoring program after school which is a volunteer program for International Baccalaureate  students meet three times a 
week, Monday,Tuesday, Thursday, after period 10, from 3:40- 5:00 PM. The two groups of students interacting also had the IB 
students ask the ELLs what after school program they are interested in. Based on what the ELLs like to do, the IB students will 
go with his/her group of ELLs and bring them to the sport they are interested in joining or a club they want to join. The IB 
students will stay with our ELL students at the various  club meetings until the ELLs make friends with the other students in the 
club. The school leadership makes sure that all school programs are all inclusive by sending invitations to ELLs by e-mail  and 
also giving them the invitations personally to the students. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77 

 

 Empower, a web-based Literacy program, is used in the beginner and intermediate levels of ENL classes.  The students use the 
program in one of their Stand alone  ENL classes.  The targeted groups are the SIFE students and SWDs. Some English classes 
also use the program for SWDs and students in the lower third percentile.  The ENL department provides materials and books 
that facilitate learning.  Bilingual dictionaries in languages spoken by our ELLs are ordered every year as well as bilingual Global 
History, US History and Algebra classes for the bilingual Spanish classes.  For the Home Language Arts classes books ( short 
stories, magazines, novels ) are ordered every year for each level.  Over $15, 000.00 is spent on new material every 
year.    Students have access to computers in the classroom where teacher driven instruction is the focal point of the lesson, 
followed by specific instruction given to the students when they have to access Empower as a re-enforcement of the lesson 
and interaction on the web site between teacher- student and student-student. The program is used everyday as part of the 
teachers' lessons. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

  Home Language support is delivered via the Transitional Bilingual Program in the five Home Language Arts classes, taught by 
the Foreign Language teachers. Assessments are delivered via teacher created exams in the home language in the  Global 
History class, two Algebra classes, and the Living Environment. These classes are  team taught by the certified Science teacher 
and the Bilingual certified teacher.  In the ENL classes Spanish is also delivered by two of the three certified 
ENL/bilingual certified teachers. Assessments are delivered via materials teacher give students in their native language. The 
Foreign Language teachers also support our Spanish speaking students in delivering the language whenever possible.  Our 
office is opened to all students, especially our Ell population, and they know that we are here to help and support them. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 Students are placed in age appropriate grade levels in their content area classes. If a student fails a content area class one 
semester, he/she is placed in an extended day class and is scheduled for the content area class that is grade appropriate.  ELLs 
are placed in their appropriate level in ENL classes based on the students’ NYSESLAT and NYSITEL scores.  Students are placed 
in the Home Language Arts classes based on their literacy skills in Spanish, from the result of the Spanish LAB test, and if they 
are SIFE (Students with Interrupted Formal Education). Students are placed in the appropriate grade level in Science, Math, 
and Social Studies classes.   Curtis HS has all required services and resources in all language represented by our ELL students. 
Some of these resources and required services is in all the signage in the school building. The Parent Handbook is in the 
process of getting translated in the various languages, and teachers always give ELL students materials and homework in their 
native language, including the teachers in the content areas that teach ENL students.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 Newly enrolled ELLs are offered the “Bridge Program” during the summer before they begin school in September.  In August 
there is a Freshman Orientation; students are programmed to attend and are given a mock schedule run.  We plan to add the 
“The Newcomers' Club” class in the spring, depending on the outcome of the 2015-2016 grant money that will be awarded to 
us. ELLs are invited to participate in the International Festival every December.  Many ELLs participate in this event because 
they can show off their traditions, food, and culture to the students and their parents.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

 ELL students are offered to study either Spanish, Italian, or French. We program students up to and including the three year 
sequence in a foreign language which terminate with a LOTE exam.  Students in all language classes including those in the 
Native Lnaguage classes are encouraged to continue in the IB/AP Spanish, Italian or French classes.  Many of them take 
advantage of the opportunity.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78 

 

 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
  At Curtis High School we have a support team of ENL and content area teachers that share and discuss strategies.  They have 
created an online “tool box” that all teachers can access via Google drive.  The team meets monthly to develop and share 
strategies and to evaluate data.  And the “tool box” continues to grow for the benefit of all teachers.   ENL teachers attend the 
Wednesday morning f (7:45 A.M. to 8:45 A.M)., professional development workshop at Curtis H.S. They also attend outside 
PDs offered by The Office of English Language Learners on a regular basis.  Content area teachers are also encouraged to 
attend  outside PDs that they can then turn key to other teachers in their content areas.  
 Secondary bilingual teachers that are instructing in languages other than English need professional learning opportunities that 
build their competence and confidence with academic discourse in languages other than English. Many bilingual teachers have 
not had the opportunity to engage in deep study of the subject matter and pedagogy in languages other than English. Their use 
of the language other than English in instruction is usually limited to translating. To engage students in deep disciplinary 
discourse as they develop concepts and build skills in student's native language, teachers need a stronger command of the 
academic language in the targeted language of instruction. Their command of the language other than English in the 
disciplines would be enriched through professional development delivered in the target language that helps them learn and 
practice academic discourse in the target language for the discipline.   Therefore, ENL and bilingual teachers are sent out to 
PDs offered by the NYC Office of English Language Learners.  Teachers also meet once a month to discuss strategies and add to 
the online "tool box" that is available to all teachers.  Their section of  the online tool box contains lesson plans in the target 
language (Spanish).  The bilingual The ENL coach also meets with the content area teachers to discuss and help with 
instructional strategies.     The tentative calendar for professional development to non ELL teachers is October 19, 2017, 
November 16, 2017, December 14, 2017. The calendar dates apply for the spring, 2018 term. We meet once a month with 
non-ELL teachers. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
During our "Small Learning Community" meetings and staff development days prior to the start of classes, the guidance 
counselor and the assistant principal prepare staff in assisting ELLs as they transition into high school. We discuss problems 
that ELLs face and inform the staff to whom they must refer the students if and when a problem arises. Some of the problems 
that ELLs deal with, especially when they new to the country, are housing, work related issues, immigration, and lack of 
parental/guardian support. The guidance counselor helps the students transition. He also helps them with homeless assistance 
if the need arises.     
Each school must provide professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs of 
English language learners.  A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all 
teachers prescribed by CR Part 80 must be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-
teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners. For all bilingual and English 
as a new language teachers, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours must be 
dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79 

 

 

teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.  Therefore, at Curtis High 
School all ENL, HLA and Bilingual Content Area teachers attend outside PDs designed to meet their needs by the Department of 
English Language Learners.  They turn key these PDs to all content area teachers that support ENL instruction at Curtis High 
School.  It is mandated that all teachers, regardless if they teach ENL students or not, attend one of those PDs a semester. The 
PDs have an emphasis on language and academic language acquisition for ENL students.  There is also an emphasis on 
academic language in Spanish because of our Transitional Bilingual program  (Spanish). Our Wednesday professional 
development, which meets for an hour, from 7:45-8:45 A.M. , also satisfies the required hours for professional development. 
Teachers are awarded certificates for having completed the required professional development. Explanation of the services 
required by the State and Federal Government are discussed as per Jose P. These include services mandated for ELLs/SWRs 
where schools in the Eastern district of New York are required by federal court to appropriately evaluate, place, and provide 
services for these students. Advocates for Children of New York continue to monitor the implementation of the Jose P 
judgements and orders.The Assistant Principal of the Foreign Language/ENL?TBE Department will keep the Attendance sheet 
and the agendas for each meeting. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
 Curtis High School is a Community School that has many CBOs that have partnered with our school.  We make ELL parents 
aware of our existing services for students and families and we ask if there are others that would be beneficial to them. Our 
workshops that are specifically held at different times during the year to discuss student goals, language development 
progress, etcetera, in the content areas and their requirements requirements. We also use the over the phone translation 
services. These services were also utilized in the previous years.The translations are provided by our ELL students' guidance 
counselor, a native language Spanish speaker. The translation services for the other languages represented at these workshops 
are provided by material translated in the languages spoken and understood by the parents/guardians.  
 
The parents' one on one meetings with parents are held throughout the school year, approximately twice a semester. We had 
one in October 18, 2017 and the next one will be the beginning of December. There, the guidance counselor discusses the 
students' goals, the language development progress, language proficiency assessment, and language development needs in all 
content area. 
  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Although Curtis High School is a Community School that has many CBOs that have partnered with our school. At Curtis HS we 
offer parents computer classes every Tuesday and Thursday from 7:00-9:00PM. The parents are taught the basic use of the 
computer and they also learn how to apply for jobs. We offer cooking classes every Wednesday evening from 6:30-7:30PM and 
the parents can take home the meal they cooked and also help themselves to the food pantry. Curtis HS also invites the 
Mexican Consulate once a year, in March. This even takes place from 10:00 Am- 4:00PM. Many parents attend the meeting 
because the Consulate help the parents fill out many forms they are required to do and also they advise them on many 
immigrant issues. They also give them attorneys names in the case that they want to become either citizens and/or obtain a 
visa.  We make ELL parents aware of our existing services for students and families and we ask if there are others that would 
be beneficial to them. If there is something that they request that is not already available, we ask our Community School 
liaisons to look into how we could incorporate it or where the family can go to receive the help that they need.  Parent 
involvment is not as high as we would like to achieve, but constant outreach by the guidance counselors, teachers and 
Comminity School liasions are making progress to the goals we have set for all parent involvement. Letters are sent home and 
given to students to inform them of any free services that are available through the school and other agencies or community 
organizations. The Parent Coordinator sends letters home and calls the parents/guardians to inform parents of the services 
available to them; for example, free English classes in the school library every Thursday evening from 7:00 P.M. to 9:00P.M.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The data used to assess Curtis High School's translation and oral interpretation is the number of entitled students 
registered at the school and the HLQ. Depending on the home language, we provide all written information in the 
language they fully understand. Letters sent home to inform parents/guardians of an upcoming event or meeting 
is in their native language so that they can completely understand what is being conveyed. Erickson Translation 
and Interpretation Services, a company located near Curtis H.S. also provides services for us in a timely manner. 
We also have the option of using the Department of Education's Translation and Interpretation Services. 
Additionally, we are fortunate to have many members of the staff who speak many of the languages represented 
in our ELL population. All posted signage in the main lobby are in multiple foreign languages, The student/parent 
handbook distributed to LEP parents/guardians at the Freshmen Orientation and at the mandatory parents' 
meeting is also written in various languages; Spanish, French Creole, and Arabic. Spanish interpretation at these 
meetings is provided is provided by staff members. Other languages are available as well via staff members and 
the translation services provided by the DOE.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of a school emergency limited English Proficient families are informed via telephone and by a person who 
speaks their language. If nobody in the school speaks their language we use language line. We also call all the 
telephone numbers that the student provided on the Emergency contact sheet. We communicate with the 
parents/guardians by sending the surveys at their homes in the languages spoken by the parents/guardians.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

The Assistant Principal of the ENL, TBE /Foreign Language Department holds meetings with staff twice a year to 
ensure that staff is aware of the goals of the Chancellor's Regulation A-663 and to inform staff of the resources we 
have available at Curtis H.S. to meet compliance. 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage

  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

At Curtis H.S. we provide parents of ELLs a copy of the Parents Bill of Rights in many languages. These documents are 
distributed at the mandatory parents'/guardians meeting, at Freshmen Orientation, when we hold a parent 'House" 
meeting, and the guidance counselor meets with all parents of over-the-counter registrants to review these materials. 
Due to the large number of ELLs, we have signage posted in multiple languages through-out the building. Front desk 
personnel use this signage to assist them in directing non-English speaking parents to appropriate locations where 
they are assisted using already mentioned translation services. All parents of non ELL students receive notices of 
services, including the bill of rights via telephone spoken by one our staff memebrs who speaks the same language as 
the parent/guardian and we also send notices at home in the language understood and spoken by the parent. Usually 
staff members translate documents in different languages. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Part E: Each year the parent coordinator circulates a parent survey prior to Parent Teacher Conferences to gather 
feedback from parents concerning the delivery and availability of services. The School Leadership Team (SLT) conducts 
an annual PASS review of the school design to assess all aspects of the instructional program and administrative 
policies. The PASS review includes parents from the SLT as well as any parent who wishes to participate. When the 
funds are available, like they are this year we will have the surveys translated by the DOE Translation Company and 
we will also have staff members translate the surveys in the different languages spoken by parents of ELLs and non 
ELLs.
