Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

John Bowne aims to provide every student with an opportunity to succeed. We expect that all of our students will be 
challenged to meet high academic standards and will leave John Bowne as literate, committed, inquisitive learners for 
life. We provide all students with a challenging learning community so that they can be prepared for a collegiate and 
professional environment and become contributing citizens of the world.  

 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

It is our goal to develop strategies within our comprehensive education plan, which engage students in rigorous 
academic instruction, enhance relations, improve communication among students of different backgrounds, foster 
positive attitudes towards school and learning, assist acculturation for our ethnically diverse population, promote 
strong community ties and propel students into their future professional and vocational aspirations. Each John Bowne 
High School student is motivated and encouraged to exceed and meet the Standards, to respect and appreciate 
individuals of different cultures, and to be a contributing citizen to their community and country. 

 

Our school community defines a rigorous classroom as one in which students develop the capacity to understand 
content that is complex, ambiguous, and personally challenging. Rigor in mathematics is defined as students 
demonstrating conceptual understanding, procedural skill and fluency, and application. We implement a wealth of 
professional learning workshops to ensure teachers design curricula that is rigorous in accordance with activities that 
fall within level 3 and 4 of Webb's DOK as well as those outlined by Hess' Cognitive Rigor Matrix.  

 

John Bowne is home to many programs including our CTE (Career Technical Education) Agriculture program, S.T.E.M. 
(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) program, A.C.A. program (Academy for Creative Artists), JROTC (Junior 
Reserve Officers' Training Corps), Law Program, Bowne Liberal Arts Institute, and our Arts Program. With over 3,600 
kids representing over forty languages and sixty countries--our school is a diverse melting pot of students deeply 
passionate about and committed to their unique and varying specialized fields of interest.  

 

The school hosts a career day highlighting careers, trades, and occupations. Students learn about the types of 
colleges, careers, and potential future potential appointment trajectory. The school also leads multiple college trips to 
Yale, Harvard, Cornell and New York University, as well as many others and has partnerships with professional theater 
companies such as Primary Stages--which allows for students to regularly see Off-Broadway productions, participate 
in talk-backs with professional actors and writers, and take advantage of their "Teen Wrights" program on site at 
Bowne, with professional playwrights. Additionally, we have partnerships with A.M.D.A., Mason Gross School of the 
Arts-Rutgers, SUNY Cobleskill, Queens College and Queensborough Community College.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

John Bowne presently serves 624 ENLs (inclusive of Bi-lingual Chinese and Bi-lingual Spanish programs). We provide 
ELL services for all levels from entering (including SIFE) through commanding as well as services when students test 
out.  

 

Our school also has 554 SWDs (Students with Disabilities) ranging from self-contained classes through mainstream as 
we provide the least restrictive environment. Through flexible programming, we provide an array of educational 
options to provide a quality experience. The testing of both ENLs and SWDs require tremendous effort and planning. 
We have self-funded an additional psychologist to assist with suicidal ideations, FBAs, de-escalation crisis work and a 
small caseload to help bring our school into compliance. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

In accordance with the Framework for Great Schools, our school made the most progress in collaborative teachers in 
which teachers are supported and nurtured, and where our professional learning community has provided 
opportunities for teachers to collaborate, take instructional risks that encourage professional growth and 
development, participate in a wealth of professional learning both inside and outside of the school, borough, city, and 
state, and country.  

Our school's key area of focus is continuing to improve rigorous instruction by implementing more frequent learning 
walks by our SLT, opportunities to analyze data and use the data cycle to spiral curricula and drive instruction, to 
increase the number of CTLE profession learning workshops offered here at Bowne by our very own Literacy Coach, 
housed in our on-site UFT teacher center, ensuring higher levels of academic discourse in all classrooms fueled by 
analyses of complex texts and tasks, in which students are required to cite textual evidence to make their thinking 
visible. Additionally, our course of action to improve rigorous instruction is to both analyze and use data from 
Advance to improve developing and ineffective practices, with an emphasis on making use of formative assessments 
in the classroom to ensure teachers are frequently monitoring student learning and misunderstanding and making 
mid-course corrections based on collected evidence of learning.  

 

Teachers are engaged in frequent classroom observations with meaningful actionable and timely feedback. Student 
achievement is enhanced through the improvement of identified competencies such as 3D: Assessment, designed to 
support both the teacher and student in progressing to the next level.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Our strength lies in co-planning and teachers working together.  

Based on feedback from the Superintendent's Office, PLF, LCI Consultant, evaluative Advance observation reports as 
of May 7, 2018 reveal that 3B (Questioning/Discussion) and 3C (Engagement) were the Danielson competencies 
identified as areas in need of focus, including student to student discussion around the task and engaging students in 
higher order thinking, increasing the level in rigor.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, John Bowne High School will increase the level of rigor in classrooms (Danielson 3C- Engaging Students in 
Learning) by increasing peer to peer discussion (Danielson 3B- Using Questioning and Discussion Technique) and using 
formative assessments and adjusting instruction according to the needs of the students in the class (3D: Using 
Assessment in Instruction). This will be evidenced by 

  Quality prompts and tasks incorporating higher level DOK tasks made evident by an increase of 3% in Effective 

or Highly Effective ratings according to Advance data in Danielson's 3B: Questioning and discussion techniques.  

  Equity in student voice and discussion through the use of protocols as evidence by an increase of 3% in school-

based PLO offerings on techniques that ensure most student voices are heard.  

  Demonstrating responsiveness and flexibility in class instruction based on formative assessments and mid-
course corrections based on collected data as evidenced by an increase in teacher evaluations of 3% in 3D: 
Assessments.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Core subject teachers in Math, Science, and Social Studies (led by 
ELA and ENL) will dedicate a minimum of one week to surveying 
four selected topics and texts relative to such controversial 
topics, to cultivate the following literacy skills across all content 
areas in preparation for our interdisciplinary research paper, 
which is level 4 performance task and fosters both rigorous 
instruction and thoughtful, peer to peer discussion. Specifically, 
teachers across all content areas will cultivate the following 
literacy skills across all content areas: citing textual evidence in 
support of analyses, engaging in close reading via annotation and 
identifying the author's purpose. 

Literacy Coach to facilitate teacher meetings to support 
implementation.

The school-wide research paper will be addressed and presented 
at PTA and SLT meetings, sharing with families how to support 
their children at home and specifically on evaluating the validity 
of sources and an ability to substantiate an argument using 
relevant and thorough textual evidence and sound reasoning. 

Differentiated Instruction for students with disabilities and for 
those whom English is a new language (ENL). These students will 
receive the assignment in November as opposed to February to 
ensure extended time to complete as well as page length

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Many staff members are in possession of professional certificates mandating professional learning hours that are CTLE 
approved. PLOs will be aligned to needs identified and discussed between the Literacy Coach, APs, and the Principal 
based upon what we are seeing in the classrooms and trends such as 3B and 3C competencies. Time continues to be 
one of the most precious commodities. Teacher teams require time to engage with each other to analyze student 
work and assessments to inform instruction and resources must be utilized to ensure the time necessary for teacher 
to engage in professional learning and collaboration. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, increase the number of students receiving a 65 or higher (55- Safety Net) on Regents exams:  

 

 
o  ELA (3%) 
o  Algebra (5%) 
o  Geometry (3%)

promote extended thinking. 

 

Provide opportunities for teachers to review task exemplars of 
significant cognitive challenge, moving teachers towards 
classifying a task as "rigorous." In these professional learning 
opportunities, teachers will be able to distinguish rigorous tasks 
from those of little or only moderate cognitive challenge. 
Committee members will receive resources such as the Common 
Core Learning Standards, the Danielson Framework, as well as

Attendance was for most of the 2017-18 school year, hovering at 85.5%. Based on a plethora of factors, student 
attendance declined. We believe that based on social and academic supports in addition to outreach, the Bowne 
Bucks program and My Brothers Keeper initiatives, the attendance will rise to a minimum goal of 88%, an increase of 
2.5%, for school-wide attendance and a goal of 5% for period attendance evident from ATS reports. We also believe 
that by co-creating success plans with parents, guidance and students, which will be periodically reviewed with 
stakeholders, attendance will rise. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the

Time-bound.  
By June 2019, John Bowne will increase opportunities for parental and community involvement through PBIS 
implementation, parent workshops, and Career Day in addition, period attendance will increase by 5% and daily 
attendance will increase from 85.5% to 88% or higher as evidenced by ATS reports.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Our strategies to attract Highly Qualified Teachers are multi-faceted. During our screening and interview process for 
new teachers, our levels of expectation become imminently clear. Our questioning of teachers during the interview 
process cuts to the core of their knowledge of being Highly Qualified. Our typical battery of questions includes lesson 
development, questioning techniques, their use of reading and writing techniques for classroom tasks, how they 
implement and use homework assignments, their knowledge of data and its usage for group instruction and 
differentiation, their comfort level with behavioral techniques and strategies, knowledge of CCLS and Regents exams, 
technological capabilities and experience and the level of parent involvement they seek. Before being hired, a demo 
lesson is frequently utilized. Teachers are supported by our Literacy Coach and various teachers, and teacher teams 
providing additional support. Teachers meet with APs for level 1 interview and then with AP and Principal and often 
other members of the school community for level II interviews that then lead to demo lessons. Mentoring is provided 
to all new teachers via pre-determined mentors with backgrounds in support of the content area teachers are 
teaching. Principal frequently corresponds with new teachers to check in and provide support. New teachers are 
assigned departmental "buddies," teachers are provided with a wealth of PLOs, teachers receive a post-observation 
conference for both informal and formal observations to ensure timely, accurate, and actionable feedback to ensure 
high quality pedagogy as well as participate in learning walks and visit AP classrooms, utilized as fishbowls to support 
learning.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Professional Development time has been generated in faculty meetings, department meetings to further develop an 
understanding of the CCSS. Curricula have and continue to be modified to increase the amount of writing in each of 
our classrooms across content areas. Also, daily PD by in house literacy coach with a daily, weekly, monthly 
professional learning calendar. Teachers have also been registered to attend Professional Learning Opportunities 
hosted by the Queens FSC across all content areas and subjects.

Teachers participate in the decision making process through the use of committees, and teams that share decision 
making responsibilities. For school wide decisions, staff are surveyed for feedback/input in the decision making 
process. 

Some examples include: 

● MoSL Committee – 4 teachers, 4 assistant principals to select MoSL assessment; multiple meetings with Principal 

● Professional Development tailored to staff demand/requests 

● Data Teams by Grade Level and by Department 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. John Bowne High School in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

John Bowne High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
The school will provide instruction focused on homework, Regents Prep, and additional instruction in various subjects 
in ELT/after-school setting instructed by teachers at a per session rate.  

 

CSD and CS team integrate common core standards and social emotional learning (SEL) into afterschool programming 
(Culinary/Nutrition, Creative Arts, Dance, etc.). Programming through CS team will be safe, supportive, and 
motivational to encourage students to become involved in school community and increase attendance. Students will 
be connected to supportive adult in school building for social emotional support through programming, which will 
enable staff/teachers to focus on instruction in the classroom.  

 

CS will produce and support school programming for families to engage and involve them in the school community 
such as parent/child workshops in afterschool enrichment subjects, Family Night, Celebrate the Cultures of Bowne, 
and SAFE showcases.  

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
-70% of 21C enrolled on track seniors will apply to at least three institutions of higher education and receive 
acceptance to a minimum of one. This will be tracked with support of Naviance partner in school. 

-60% of enrolled students in school’s portion of Academic Enrichment for 21C enrolled participants will demonstrate 
improvement in corresponding classes and Regents exams. 65% will self -report increased confidence and 
participation in these classes. 

-75% of enrolled students in afterschool programming will self-report increased knowledge in topic chosen and/or 
improvement in pre- to post evaluation tool relative to involvement/connection to school environment 

-70% of identified students in SAFE programming will demonstrate improved attendance compared to previous school 
year 

-70% of identified students in SAFE programming will demonstrate improvement on pre- to post evaluation tool 
relative to SEL trait development including indicators of wellbeing (emotions, behaviors), emotional skills (resilience, 
coping), social skills (friendship, conflict), learning skills (work management, engagement), and perceptions of school, 
home and community support. 

-100 guardians will be serviced through workshops. 100 will participate in celebrations and/or student achievement 
events during 2017-2018 school year.

100% of all students identified as needing Success Mentors (30-35 21C enrolled participants with 80-89.9% YTD 
attendance in previous year) will be paired with an appropriate mentor and receive additional attendance oversight 
and support. 60% of identified students will demonstrate improved attendance compared to previous school year. 

 

 

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?

Part 3c. Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following: 
1. 

Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and 
together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will 
lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.

The ENL/ELA Title III Supplemental Program aims to foster the development of the academic 
and literacy skills necessary for success on the ELA Regents Exam. This program specifically 
targets those students who have previously taken the Common Core ELA Regents and received a 
score of 64% or lower.  Materials used in this program include: ELA Regents exams from 
nysedregents.gov, school-based “Rocking the Regents” resources from the ELA and ENL 
departments, Collections, and a selection of Common Core Reading from the grade 11 and 12 
ELA curriculum.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Instruction is carefully tailored to each individual student’s needs based on state assessment 
scores on both the CC ELA Regents and the NYSESLAT.  Formative assessments from grade 
level ELA and ENL support classes are also used to determine the skills focus of the 
program.  Targeted skills include: reading comprehension strategies, identifying author’s 
purpose, identifying and analyzing central ideas, paraphrasing textual evidence, inferencing, 
developing an argument, and decoding the language of multiple choice questions. 
Social Studies 
The Social Studies Title III Supplemental Program is designed to raise student achievement on 
both the U.S. History and Global Regents Exams.  Instruction caters to each student’s individual 
needs based on social studies exams and school-created baseline assessments. Reading and 
writing scores from the NYSESLAT are also analyzed and used to guide the design and delivery 
of targeted instruction. 
Within the program, certified instructors focus heavily on reading comprehension and academic 
writing skills.  Targeted skills include:  text annotation, multiple choice strategies, interpretation 
of maps and charts, determining author’s point of view as well as citing and paraphrasing textual 
evidence to support thematic essay writing.  Title III instructors also emphasize building 
background knowledge on challenging historical topics that may be new or unfamiliar to 
students. 
Chinese Language Arts 
The Chinese Language Arts Title III Supplemental Program is designed to meet the 
interdisciplinary needs of both native and non-native Chinese learners.  This integrated program 
utilizes Chinese Language Arts in an effort to raise student achievement on all state Regents 
exams.  All Chinese Language Arts teachers also target the critical-thinking skills necessary for 
success on the ELA Regents exam. 
Instruction is carefully tailored to each individual student’s needs based on all state assessment 
scores and native and non-native Chinese baseline assessments.  Materials used in this program 
include:  state regents exams, integrated Chinese language textbooks and workbooks, and 
integrated Chinese character workbooks.  Targeted skills include: note-taking, annotation, 
decoding, summarizing, inferencing, and paraphrasing textual evidence. 
Mathematics 
The Mathematics Title III Supplemental Program is designed to meet the needs of students who 
need additional academic assistance in deciphering, decoding, and solving complex 
mathematical concepts.  The program aims to foster the development of the necessary critical-
thinking skills necessary for success on all Mathematics Regents Exams.  
Materials used in this program include:  Mathematics textbooks and workbooks, online Regents 
exams, teacher-generated materials, and in-house baseline assessments.  Data analysis of 
midterm and final exams allows instructors to target the types of questions and problems that 
pose the greatest challenge to English language learners. Instruction therefore focuses heavily on 
the deconstruction of word problems as those have proven to be the most challenging for English 
language learners. 
  
Based on the needs of the students, teachers build literacy using strategies to best support 
learning across the curriculum, and develop the academic language that will ensure success in 
high school. We emphasize the four skills, listening, speaking, reading and writing to develop 
English proficiency. Student centered learning, portfolio assessments and project-based activities 
are used to evaluate student progress. The use of scaffolding techniques and the latest technology 
in computer based reading and writing instruction support English Language Learners in 
accelerating academic learning. The proposed program will include rigorous content and 
application of knowledge by improving higher order thinking skills in order to prepare students 
for college level writing. Supported curricula will include, Benchmark Book Series, for our 
entering and emerging students.  Other supported curricula will be materials that are

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards in Mathematics, ELA, Science, and Social 
Studies, we will also be using the Achieve 3000 software.  Teachers will use strategies that 
emphasize close reading and the teaching of reading complex, informational text based on the 
Common Core Learning Standards. Teachers will select texts that increase in complexity over 
time. In addition, our ELLs need to increase their abilities in listening and speaking.  
Teachers record attendance via sign in sheet of students, and submit to AP ENL every 2 weeks.

Begin description here:            
In order to prepare teachers to teach academic language and challenging content, John Bowne 
H.S. Literacy Coach, J. Hsueh and Bilingual coordinator, Grace Yu, will provide 2-4, two hour 
Professional Development sessions, conducted as a cycle, during after-school hours in October-
April 2019. The following teachers will receive training: C. Newton,  V. Negri, S. Chyn, T. 
Liew, I Ramirez, I. Abreu, K. Cedeno-Rodriguez, E. Galindo, A. Sanchez.  J. Zhang and D. Cho, 
C. Faraj,  C Park, and P Gussmann   
Data such as Regents, formative assessments and NYSESLAT results show that ELLs need 
support with academic language and the comprehension of complex texts.  To ensure that 
students receive content knowledge, build English language proficiency and meet the rigorous 
demands of the Common Core Learning Standards, we will provide PD sessions on the topics 
listed below: 
SIOP 
 Core Academic Language Instruction   
  Increasing Text Complexity: Reading Strategies to Enhance ELL Instruction 
  Vocabulary Explicit Instruction for ELLs 
 
Participants will also analyze student work from classroom and state assessments in order to 
modify lesson plans, unit plans and curriculum maps based on the data found from analysis.   
Ms. Richards is a recognized CTLE provider and receives ongoing training from the UFT 
teacher center.  Both Ms. Richards and Ms. Yu are currently being trained for SIOP 
certification.   This PD will positively impact the ELLs by increasing regents scores,  preparing 
them for college and careers.

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We assess early literacy skills of our ELLs through teacher created assessments.  We evaluate data for ELLs based on class 
grades, regents scores, passing percentages, data gained from teacher teams after evaluating student work,  NYSESLAT scores, 
and EDAT data. The data helps teachers make informed decisions about student grouping, planning lessons and materials 
preparation.   We are currently in the stages of developing a reading inventory to assess Spanish and Chinese bilingual new 
admits.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We have a newly created bilingual coordinator position who will be working with the NLA and interdisciplinary teacher 
teams to create formative assessments.  We used the NLA Spanish Assessment from schoolnet to test students native

language literacy level.  Our bilingual coordinator  held teacher team meetings to address data, we also use teacher teams to 
analyze assessments from the math, science and history and english departments along with ENL teachers to analyze Regents 
and midterm exams of our ELLs.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evalulate the success of our programs for ELLs based on NYSESLAT and regents data. For the past three years, over 100 
ELLs have scored proficient on the NYSESLAT. 45.16% of ELLs scored 65 or higher on the June 2017 Common Core ELA regents. 
Uniform common in each department as well as Native Language Arts assessment.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We have a bilingual/ ENL tutoring program in all content areas through Title III.  We also offer AIS for students on an as needed 
basis throughout the day.  If students are in need of credits, we offer PM school and Saturday school programs. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to question here:    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We use the EDAT to identify students at risk of making minimal progress.  We also use EDAT to determine students English 
language Proficiency Levels in which we inform all content area teachers so that they can use the information to guide 
instruction.    We analyze Regents data between ENL and content teachers to discuss findings and revise curriculum maps to 
support ELLS.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We offer Professional Learning Cycles for all teachers of ELLS such as "Equity for ELLS" in which teachers analyzed EDAT data to 
inform instruction of their specific students.  We have interdisciplinary teacher team meetings to discuss common assessments 
and analyze Ell data from midterm and final exams.  We have team leaders and grade leaders in place to turnkey findings.  We 
also discuss data and findings from EDAT, Regents etc. for ELLS at cabinet meetings.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

We offer a freestanding ENL program. Students are placed in heterogeneous groups, 9th   and 10th   graders are 
together in one class and/or 11th   and 12th   graders are together in one class. Integrated and standalone ENL are 
implemented as per CR Part 154.2. Students receive core content classes and integrated ENL.. Content area teachers 
use ENL methodology to deliver instruction in science, social studies, mathematics, and ELA.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

We also offer a Transitional Bilingual Program in both Spanish and Chinese. TBE teachers use the home language to 
deliver instruction to students of various levels of content mastery and literacy development. Mathematics, Social 
Studies and Science classes are taught in Spanish and Chinese.  Students are grouped in each content according to 
ELP levels.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

All ELLs, including students in bilingual, integrated and stand-alone offer home language support. Our instructional program 
includes a Transitional Bilingual Education in both Spanish and Chinese. We also offer a freestanding ENL program. The 
schedule allows for all mandated minutes. The mandated minutes include the following: Entering: 225 minutes of integrated 
ENL per week and 450 minutes of stand alone ENL per week, Emerging: 225 minutes of integrated ENL per week and 225 
minutes of stand alone ENL per week, Transitioning: 225 minutes of integrated ENL per week and 225 minutes of ELA per 
week, Expanding: 225 minutes of ENL per week, Commanding: 225 minutes of integrated ENL per week.  ELA is the core 
content area for the integrated ENL classes. Home Language Arts is offered 225 minutes per week in the bilingual Spanish and 
Chinese programs. Home language arts classes are aligned to the Common Core Standards. All proficiency levels are 
receiving co-taught classes  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Chinese and Spanish speaking students in the TBE program receive instruction from bilingual teachers in content areas such as 
Living Environment, Earth Science, Chemistry, Global Studies, U. S. History, Economics, Geometry, and Intermediate Algebra. In 
stand alone and integrated ENL classes, newcomers and LTEs are grouped heterogeneously or homogenously depending on 
their skills and deficiencies and the assigned task. Students increase proficiency through practice in listening, speaking, reading 
and writing.  
       Based on the Common Core Learning Standards, teachers focus on activities and scaffolding techniques that enhance 
critical thinking skills and the language proficiency needed to pass content area classes and regents exams. Through self-
assessment, rubrics and checklists, our programs effectively anchor reading and writing strategies in content areas. Students 
learn to cite textual evidence and draw inferences from the text.  Teachers engage students in writing arguments to support 
claims with clear reasons and relevant evidence. In accordance with the school wide policy, ELLs write interdisciplinary 
research papers. Classes are involved in close reading of complex articles and current research topics selected by students. In 
order to allow ELLs access to academic discourse, ENL teachers follow a unified unit sequence that includes a wide range of 
content area themes. In addition, ENL /ELA classes follow the ELA curriculum. Teachers have been trained on using scaffolding 
techniques to make content comprehensible. In addition to using graphic organizers and audio-visuals to build vocabulary 
development, the following strategies are also incorporated: pairwork based on language proficiency, explicit teaching of 
reading comprehension i.e. identifying main idea, cause-effect, fact-opinion and context clues. Additionally, building semantic 
awareness, active engagement in accountable talk, student-to-student interaction, partner reading, identifying tiered 
vocabulary words and activating prior knowledge. Skills based curriculum maps in various content areas are used that focus on 
skills such as paraphrasing,  inferencing, formulating questions, identifying author's purpose, word choice, note-taking and 
summarization.   
        To maximize instruction, ELLs are grouped based on proficiency levels. Through peer editing, self assessment, rubrics, and 
meaningful feedback from the teacher, student writing is enhanced. Instructional Materials - ENL teachers use materials from 
the    ELA curriculum, Benchmark series, text exemplars from the Common Core Learning Standards, informational text, 
articles from Achieve3000, web based writing program Write to Learn, Active Skills for Reading, Longman Social Studies, 
Longman Science, Gateway to Science, etc.  
         There are also a number of existing services for long term ELLs. Based on NYSESLAT scores, LTEs are strategically 
programmed one period daily for classes in Empower3000. Empower3000 students participate in a web-based program that 
helps to improve literacy and build writing and vocabulary skills. LTEs are also programmed for support in classes that 
terminate in a regents in content areas such as English Language Arts, Algebra, Living Environment, Global Studies and US 
History.    
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   To ensure that students are evaluated appropriately in their home language, the following assessments are administered to 
ELLs as per state guidelines: Spanish LAB, ELE ReadingTest, Chinese Reading Test, and Regents Exams. The results are used to 
for instructional planning and to provide services in bilingual classes. Students use bilingual dictionaries in their home 
languages to enhance comprehension in  classrooms across content areas.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 After school instructional support classes are offered to ELLs who require more than four years to graduate. SIFE receive 
instruction in oral skills and pre-reading through differentiation and are grouped homogeneously in ENL for three periods 
daily. Teachers focus on increasing literacy through content area themes and explicit vocabulary related instructional 
strategies that are differentiated at each level. By scaffolding academic language and building phonetic awareness, teachers 
support the specific needs of SIFE. ELLs in school less than three years and Long Term ELLs have been scheduled to take the 
ELA and Global Studies mock regents, ELA acuity exams, ELL periodic assessment and ELA regents. Former ELLs receive 
continuing transitional support for two years after reaching proficiency on the NYSESLAT. Students receive bilingual 
dictionaries and glossaries, extended time on exams, and after school instructional support classes as well as a co taught 
English class with ENL teacher.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELLs identified as having special needs receive individual and prescriptive plans that are designed to facilitate differentiated 
instruction. These students are provided with related services and resource room as indicated in their IEP. Our goal for ELL-
SWDs is to move them to higher NYSESLAT levels and to become proficient in English. We provide them with culturally relevant 
material.The computer based program Achieve3000 is incorporated in the daily instruction of ELL-SWDs to improve literacy 
levels.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our goal for ELL-SWDs is to move them to a less restrictive environment. Where possible, we place students in an ICT setting. 
We have ICT classes in every core subject, giving students access to the general population in a larger setting. We have 
increased the number of classes so that more students take advantage of being moved to a less restrictive environment. 
Teacher teams use differentiated instructional strategies and techniques such as daily logs, peer reading, word lists, wall 
charts, student proofreading, flash cards, repetition and other alternate ways of explaining to support ELL-SWDs.     
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Title III funding provides after school instructional support classes to support SIFE, Newcomers and Long term ELLs in ELA, 
Math, and other content areas.  
English as a Second Language and Native Language Arts Chinese 
• Bilingual Chinese Living Environment, Chemistry, Earth Science 
• Bilingual Spanish Living Environment, Chemistry, Earth Science 
• Bilingual Chinese Global Studies and U.S. History and Government 
• Bilingual Spanish Global Studies and US History and Government 
• Bilingual Spanish and Chinese Mathematics    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

We plan to expand our uses of checklists for monitoring individuals and groups of students, student self-reflection of their own 
progress in learning and tracking their grades. We will follow the model recommended by NY State and incorporate 
freestanding ENL and integrated ENL and ELA instruction involving two individually certified teachers co-teaching for the 
required number of minutes for each proficiency level in the integrated ENL/ELA classes.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

n/a    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are represented in all programs and are afforded equal access.  ELLs are informed of school programs by bilingual 
guidance staff who make visits to classes. Guidance counselors inform students about extra-curricular activities, school clubs, 
sports teams, interpreting transcripts and college planning. The bilingual parent coordinator sends letters to parents informing 
them of school programs. Translation services are available at PTA meetings and parent-teacher conferences. College office 
counselors are bilingual and invite colleges with bilingual staff to come to the school to speak to ELLs.  ELLs attend after school 
instructional support classes on week day afternoons and Saturdays. Students participating in the Saturday ENL College 
Readiness Program increase academic language and awareness of the college application process. They also go on field trips to 
colleges and museums.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Smartboards are used in ENL classrooms to build literacy, scaffold meaning and deepen understanding of vocabulary.  ENL 
teachers use ELA curricula, social studies and science content based materials, the Benchmark series, text exemplars from the 
Common Core Learning Standards, non-fiction informational text, Active Skills for Reading, Longman Social Studies, Longman 
Science, etc. In addition, we implement web based technology such as Achieve 3000 and Write to Learn. In addition, emerging, 
transitioning, and expanding students utilized the Academic Vocabulary Toolkit and English 3D to increase academic word 
knowledge in class two days per week.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In order to support the home language, bilingual dictionaries and glossaries are available in ENL, Home Language Arts and 
bilingual content area classes. Library books are also available in the students’ native languages. Instruction is provided in the 
New Language Arts Chinese and Spanish classes to transfer skills to English. For example, students read texts in Home 
Language Arts that are taught in ENL and ELA classes. Students read the text in the home language and discuss, read and write 
about the same text in the home language and in English in alignment with the CCLS.  ELLs receive supplemental instruction, 
academic support in regents preparation in after school and Saturday tutorial programs.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The resources that we use correspond to the ages and grade levels of the adolescent ELLs that we serve. We organize and 
analyze data to ensure that ELLs receive appropriate to the cognitive needs and services for ELLs SWD's.   We program 
according to grade level in order to provide equitable access .    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
No co -location 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We have orientation activities to assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. During evening workshops, 
the students and parents receive information about ENL and bilingual program choices. They also participate in school tours 
and presentations from the different departments. At various times throughout the school year, we hold ELL parent meetings 
with translators present, to inform parents and students of our instructional programs, graduation requirements, academic

progress in English language acquisition in ENL classes, English language proficiency results and language development needs 
in all content areas.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Language electives offered to ELLs include Chinese Creative Writing, Advanced Placement Chinese and Advanced Placement 
Spanish.     
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our literacy coach, Joy Richards,  provides professional learning to the following: all ENL, bilingual and content area teachers in 
science, mathematics, social studies, and special education. In addition, guidance counselors, school psychologist, speech 
therapist receive training at the guidance department meetings, AP Organization, A. Sencer provides orientation to school 
secretaries and parent coordinator. Assistant principals receive training during cabinet meetings. 
The literacy coach offers professional development to ENL and bilingual teachers in the following areas: Co-teaching Strategies, 
CR Part 154 regulations, Integrated ENL Orientation, Close Reading Strategies, Effective Questioning Approaches, Peer 
Intervisitiation, etc. AP ELL, T. DiMaggio, provides PD to Title III teachers after school and during ENL department meetings in 
areas such as best practices for co-teaching, teacher modeling, reading complex text, citing textual evidence and student 
generated questioning. AP English, S Remeika, provides PD in aligning ELA content area instruction with integrated ENL and 
scaffolding for ELLs and ELLs with disabilities. ENL and bilingual teachers attend PD sessions out of the building provided by the 
DOE OELL in areas such as collaborative reading and teaching academic vocabulary to ELLs. ENL Coordinator, C.Newton 
provides content area teachers as well as SWD teachers and alternate placement paras PD in language objectives and ENL part 
154 Regs.  In addition, small teams of teachers meet to analyze student work. Teachers of ELLs also participate in 
intervistitation and sharing best practices.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
In addition to the PD outlined in question 1, ENL and bilingual teachers attend PD provided by the OELL in areas such as 
collaborative reading and teaching academic vocabulary. Small teams of teachers meet to analyze student work and 
collaborate on strategies to improve literacy based on the needs of the students. Teachers also participate in intervisitation 
and sharing best practices. The literacy coach provides certificates for participation in PD. Copies are maintained in the AP ELL 
office room 258. Our Literacy center is now recognized as a at place to go for CTLE.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In order to meet individually with parents of ELLs, we plan to hold evening meetings, the first will be held in October 
2017.  ENL and bilingual teachers will come in for per session and meet with parents to discuss goals of the program and 
language development needs of individual students. In addition, where feasible, teachers will meet during the day, including 
possibly during C-6 assignments. Qualified interpreters/translators will be available to assist in the language parents best 
understand. Additionally, we will use Skedula and Kinvolved to increase ELL parent engagement. Both programs provide 
parents the opportunity to view student grades and attendance records and communicate with their teachers. Kinvolved is an 
ap messaging system that allows schools to inform families about attendance and behavior. It also identifies classroom and 
schoolwide trends. Kinvolved sends messages to parents in the home languages. Records of in-person meetings, phone calls 
and messages/ letters sent, are stored in Skedula and Kinvolved electronically.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents of ELLs attend PTA meetings where Spanish and Chinese interpreters are available at every meeting. There is a list of 
staff members who speak various languages that we call when translation services are needed. We also utilize the DOE 
translation services number to call. ELL parents also attend Title III workshops facilitated by AP ELL, bilingual guidance 
counselors and parent coordinator. Workshop topics include the following: Understanding school documents, attendance, 
after school instructional support classes, NYS regents requirements, ways to support school issues with teens, college 
readiness, college choices, financial aid, etc. In addition,  ELL parents also participate in Family Science Night and Career 
Day.  We also provide parent workshops through our Title III program.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Laura Izzo Iannelli, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Language preferences of the parent community are assessed using the Home Language reports available on ATS 
such as the RHLA and the RAPL to identify home languges and preferred parent languages. The greatest need for 
our building based on language is Spanish and Chinese.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
