Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.

a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission Statement: At Essex Street Academy, our mission is to engage students in meaningful learning and prepare 
them to realize productive lives and contribute to the greater good of the world around them.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

We offer courses that challenge students to develop their own ideas and push them to learn by doing: designing and 
conducting experiments, developing a historical thesis, analyzing works of literature through a critical lens and 
developing mathematical solutions and proofs to problems. Small class sizes at ESA make a personalized approach to 
education possible, enabling teachers to develop an individual relationship with each student. At ESA, our students 
are active, not passive, learners, and will graduate from our school confident in their ability to tackle any problem 
they encounter .  

43% of ESA's students identify as Latino and 37% as African-American. 

Strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented: At ESA, we are currently 
celebrating accomplishments in several endeavors. Our current focus is to increase student voice in the school 
community and create opportunities for students to contribute to school leadership by, in addition to other 
initiatives, having students produce our bi-monthly town hall meetings. To achieve our goal of promoting student 
voice in school culture, we hired a community director two years ago, who oversees our numerous initiatives to 
further strengthen student and parent involvement. Students also rolled out ESA Core Values this year as a result of 
collaborate work with the social work department, community director and a group of 10 dedicated student leaders.  

 

ESA has a well-developed foreign language department with advanced course offerings. We offer two levels of 
Spanish and three levels of French. We also have a Student Ambassadors program, which gives students the 
opportunity to travel abroad. In the past, students traveled to Brazil, Japan, and Peru. Our third cohort of French 
student ambassadors travelled to France study French language and culture near Lyon at the Lycee Camille Corot this 
past spring. For most of the students, this trip was the first time they have traveled outside of New York State, let 
alone outside of the United States. A trip like this is a powerful experience for all students involved. The program was 
started by our French teacher in 2014 and has continued with the support of donors and extensive fund raising by our 
students. Our program received students from France for the first time this past year.  

Essex Street Academy offers a rich College-bound Program to help to prepare students for college. Starting in the 11 
th grade, we offer students college-bound classes, one-on-one college counseling, SAT prep, and day and overnight 
college trips to schools. We have a full partnership with College Access: Research and Action’s program, which 
supports first generation college-bound students in the summer between high school graduation and summer 
matriculation. We believe that the implementation of this program will help to ensure that more of ESA’s graduating 
seniors matriculate and remain in college. Through our partnership with CARA, College Access-Research and Action, 
we have a college coach, whose role is to assist students in every step of the college application and enrollment 
process. This past year we have started offering one-day college trips out of town  

 

The school’s primary partner organization is Greenwich Village Youth Council (GVYC). The school also enjoys an 
extensive partnership with NYU. Student teachers from NYU work at ESA; social work interns from NYU work with our 
kids; ESA teachers teach aspiring teachers in conjunction with NYU Faculty and students who are excelling in ESA 
coursework are given the opportunity to take credit-bearing courses at NYU. In addition to our partnerships with 
GVYC and NYU, we have partnerships with Volunteers of Legal Services and Parson's School of Design. Students also 
have the opportunity to take college level courses through BMCC’s College Now program.  

Essex Street Academy offers students a robust enrichment program, free of charge to ESA students. Four days a week, 
we offer morning office hours, from 8:15 a.m. - 9:15 a.m. In addition, we offer a number of enrichment activities. We 
are particularly proud of our theatre program at ESA. Their performances over the last several years have included:

At ESA, we work as a staff to ensure that students develop the skills required to complete the graduation 
requirements associated with each academic department. Every course at ESA is designed by ESA’s teachers, using a 
common curriculum plan, which then guides their lesson planning. The plan insures that teachers: construct their 
curriculum using the Habits of Mind as a framework (use of evidence, analysis, making connections, and taking risks), 
design courses around essential questions or inquiry, define skill and content standards that students are expected to 
master, develop PBATs and interim assessments to assess student mastery, differentiate assignments based on 
process, product, and content, and develop lesson plans that ensure that students will develop the content and skill 
standards. Students in grades 9/10 are mastering the skills needed as the foundation for success in Senior Circle 
courses, while student in grades 11/12 (Senior Circle) are mastering the skills needed to complete their graduation 
requirements.  

At ESA, we believe students should be challenged intellectually, socially and emotionally. The PBATS, Round tables 
(the 9 th and 10 th grade exhibition of student mastery of skill and content), and interim assessments are all designed 
for students to develop their own opinions and defend their ideas against criticism and questioning. Teaching 
practices, across departments, emphasize the guiding principles of the, now defunct, Coalition of Essential Schools 
and the values of the New York Performance Assessment Consortium , which include depth over breadth, student as 
worker/teacher as coach, demonstration of mastery, active student learning, discussion-based classrooms, and 
student choice. In classrooms, students can be seen working to solve problems, mastering a task, or responding to an 
essential question. As they work to meet our academic standards, students experiment with ideas and have 
opportunities to reflect on their progress independently, with classmates, and with their teachers.  

 

We have undertaken a number of initiatives to impact the quality of the instructional core across classrooms. In the 
2014-2015 school year, we began to use the Authentic Instruction and Assessment: Common Standards for Rigor and 
Relevance in Teaching Academic Subjects (Fred Newman, et. al) to define intellectually rigorous instruction. This 
framed our professional development work for the 2014-2017 school years and will continue to frame this current 
year. Recognizing that our instructional practices were not as effective as we wanted them to be to meet the need of 
our most struggling learners, our school's focus is on ensuring that inclusive practices are guiding teaching and 
learning in our classrooms while maintaining a rigorous learning environment for all students.  

 

Collaborative Teachers:  

In 2014 - 2018, ESA successfully maximized common planning time in the school through a schedule adjustment. With 
the new schedule, we hold faculty meeting every week, a collaborative period every week for teachers, and have time 
for department meetings every other week. In addition, we held regular meetings with Department Coordinators to 
set agendas for department meetings, including establishing protocols for analyzing lesson plans, project assignments, 
and student work.  

In 2014-2017, we used the Beehive Professional Development Model to approach work to improve instruction. The 
Beehive model was adapted from the Sci-Ed Innovators fellowship , a year long fellowship for science teachers who 
explore solutions to their classroom problems using the Democratic Science Teaching Framework. In the Beehive 
Professional Development Model, teachers identified a POP. Teachers were then organized in to groups, across 
disciplines, called Beehives. In their Beehives, teachers refined their POP based on feedback from colleagues; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

identified actionable steps to take in their classrooms; shared results after implementing their steps; received more 
feedback from the Beehive, and then developed new interventions. Each teacher analyzed the impact of their 
intervention and reflected on the process and next steps in a round table presentation of their work to their 
colleagues.  

In addition to Beehives, we conducted a process we call “Professional Conversations” in department meetings. This 
served as an opportunity for teachers to collaborate with and receive feedback from their department members 
around work being done towards the school wide goal of raising the level of intellectual rigor in instruction. The 
majority of teachers in the school presented as a part of the Professional Conversation process and all teachers 
participated in several Professional Conversations as collaborators.  

The result of the use of Professional Conversations in department meetings was that we met our goal, that over 75% 
of teachers were effective or highly effective (as evaluated using the Danielson Rubric) in their area of focus by 
midyear.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

To support students of color, we believe that it is important to develop curriculum for both regular classes and 
advisory that is culturally responsive that empowers our students. 4% of ESA's students are ELLs, all of whom are 
either transitioning or expanding. Students are given additional support with their language skills via small group 
instruction. 25% of the student population has an IEP. Teachers create lesson plans using principals of Universal 
Design, and instructional strategies for teacher and learning strategies for students are developed by the IEP team. 
We are also working with an outside consultant who provides professional development for teachers on creating an 
inclusive classroom. Two years ago, we hired an additional special education teacher who is providing coaching to 
general education teachers to ensure that all classroom teachers are meeting the learning needs of our diverse 
population.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Elements of the Framework for Great Schools: Progress 

Rigorous Instruction: At Essex Street Academy, the ultimate standard for rigor for both teacher and student is the 
process of completing the graduation requirements that have been designed and continually updated in alignment 
with the New York Performance Assessment Consortium. These performance tasks demand that the students 
demonstrate mastery in discipline specific skills developed over four years of academic work at Essex Street Academy. 
Students complete graduation requirements (PBATs) in Literature, Social Studies, Math, Science, and Art. For each of 
these projects ( an analytical essay in literature, a social studies research paper, an extended or original science 
experiment, problem solving at higher levels of mathematics, and work in a series in art), students complete an 
extensive piece of writing, and an oral defense, presenting their work to a panel made up of teachers, students, and 
an outside evaluator. All of the PBATS are evaluated using Consortium rubrics for writing and oral presentations. This 
rigorous approach demands that students synthesize and apply the content and skills that they have learned in each 
discipline to an authentic task. Further, they must demonstrate mastery “on demand” in front of a group of people. 
Students begin to prepare for these PBATs when they enter ESA.

Rigorous Instruction: We have articulated a schoolwide Problem of Practice, which will drive professional 
development next year: Looking ahead: What does it for ESA to be a progressive school? How can collaboration 
amplify our goals for learning?  

Supportive Environment: We will introduce a student-driven peer mediation program to the school community to 
continue to develop alternative approaches to student conflicts in our effort to reduce student suspensions and 
discipline infractions.  

Effective School Leadership: School leaders will hold professional development sessions, designed in collaboration 
with a teacher development team, that will foster interdisciplinary collaboration to support teachers in a variety of 
areas that impact their growth as growth as teachers, including curriculum design, discipline and classroom 
management, and unit planning.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
In our most recent School Quality Review (2015-2016), the reviewer wrote that, "In many classes, students are 
engaged in curricula-aligned challenging tasks and demonstrate higher-order thinking skills in their work products. 
However, in a few classes, evidence of higher order thinking was inconsistent and student ownership of their learning 
was not yet evident across classrooms."  We addressed this need in our PD for the past three years, where we have 
focused on designing opportunities for students to demonstrate Higher Order Thinking, Substantive Conversation and 
in our daily instruction. This past year's instructional focus was on increasing rigor in and quality in students' writing. 
Based on feedback and observations, we identified that while we are designing these opportunities, in our efforts to 
differentiate instructional practice, we need to push our most struggling students to challenge themselves by 
completing PBAT, the most rigorous of our formal assessments. This entails developing new ways of collaborating 
with one another on new and innovative instructional strategies to increase engagement. According to the 2017-2018 
School Survey measures, 68% of students reported positive personal attention and support feedback. While this is 
above the city-wide average, we would like to improve on our numbers to support all students to succeed. 65% of 
students said that teachers noticed when they weren't learning something and 70% of students said that teachers 
helped them catch up if they were behind. To improve on these numbers, we have articulated the following school-
wide goal for improving instruction and outcomes: Looking ahead: What does it for ESA to be a progressive school? 
How can collaboration amplify our goals for learning?   

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Our first annual goal is to increase the number of students who are successfully completing PBATS in the 11th grade so 
that by June 2019, 80% of the junior class will have completed at least 2 academic PBATS.

Continue instructional coaching model- department 
coordinators will observe and debrief 2 classes a week with 
teachers in their department and identify areas of growth for 
ensuring both rigor and support for at-risk students.  

Conduct a mid-semester review, both in the fall and spring, to 
identify students who are not on track towards completing at 
least 2 academic PBATs during the academic year, conduct 
parent outreach and provide obligatory office hours to said 
students.  

Advisors will assist 11th grade students mid-semester in SMART 
Goal planning, to assist with completing the necessary work to 
successfully finish their PBAT work by end of the semester. Will 
communicate this goal to academic coach.  

At the school’s fall and spring “Back to School Night,” teachers 
will share their curriculum with parents and provide an example 
of the type of work that students might be asked to do in a class, 
on a daily basis.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
ESA has always prided itself on the sense of community in the school and a strong school culture that is safe and 
caring. Based on the 2017-2018 School Quality Snapshot, 96% of students feel safe in their classrooms. We also 
received a Well-Developed on our 2015-2016 School Quality Review on the indicator of School Culture (3.4). In 2017-
18, we expanded our Student Voice initiatives to create a peer-mediation team. However, we still have not developed 
a robust system for implementing Restorative Justice practices for discipline infractions. In 2017-18, we had 15 
suspensions (1 more than we had in 2016-17). Of those 15 suspensions, 11 of the suspended students were black, 8 of 
whom were female. We need to address this glaring disproportionality in punitive discipline. We are doing so through 
expanding our social work support specific groups of young men and young women of color. We are also expanding 
our Restorative Practices initiatives to train more teachers and train students to be a part of a RJ Youth Team in hopes 
of establishing a schoolwide Restorative Culture that builds the capacity of students and adults to from closer 
relationships and respond to harm without suspending. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, we will reduce the number of level 4 and 5 infractions as per NYC DOE discipline code by 15%.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Feedback from our most recent quality review indicated that we are Well Developed in indicator 4.2 Teacher Teams 
and leadership development. In particular, the review acknowledges the effectiveness of our "Beehive" PD program, 
which differentiates PD for each discipline based on department generated Problems of Practice that align to the 
school-wide Area of Focus. The 2017-18 Quality guide also indicates that our teachers are highly collaborative (score 
of 4.67 out of 5). However, internal surveying of staff opinion indicates that, while our collaboration in department 
teams is a strength, we do not have enough opportunities to collaborate as a whole staff.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, the ESA Equity Working Group will plan and successfully implement 6 school-wide PD sessions focused on 
issues of equity in our school community. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21 

 
Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Draft Equity PD plan including topics, texts, protocols, debriefs. 
Essential Question will be: How can we actively work against 
perpetuating institutionalized oppression in our school? Will 
focus on school discipline practices, instructional practices, and 
collaboration practices. Fundamental to this work will be an 
examination of issues of equity among our own staff. 

Implement PD every 6 weeks throughout school year; topics 
covered will be: implicit bias, privilege, power, and oppression, 
and how these issues affect our practice at school with regards 
to race, class, gender, sexual orientation and special education 
status.  

Survey staff internally on effectiveness of PD and compare 
School Quality Guide Survey results from students and teachers 
on Collaboration, diverse cultural representation in instruction, 
and fair discipline 

Conduct an attitudinal survey of students at the start of the 
school year and at the end of the new school to identify changes 
in how student needs are being met in the areas of race, class, 
gender, ELL status, special needs and sexual orientation.  

Identify areas of improvement to focus on next year based on 
the survey in the areas race, class, gender, ELL status, special 
needs and sexual orientation.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

On the 2017-18 school survey, 96% of those surveyed responded positively to questions regarding effective 
leadership, 14% above citywide survey results. While over 90% of staff responded that the school's professional 
development experiences have allowed them to try out new ideas and that they have had opportunities to 
collaborate productively with teachers on professional development, teachers rarely collaborate across departments 
to plan for interdisciplinary instruction. As a school we believe that teachers need to collaborate across disciplines to 
continue to innovate their practice and allow students to experience coherence of experience and make connections 
across disciplines.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of all teachers will have reported a significant increase, as measured by an attitudinal survey, in 
their ability to innovate instructional and socio-emotional practice in their classrooms as a result of interdisciplinary 
collaboration.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

At ESA we have always considered our school culture to be that of a family and have valued close relationships 
between students, staff and families. Our advisory system is the pillar of our strong community culture, encouraging 
frequent communication between advisors, students and families about academics as well as fostering socio-
emotional support. In the 2017-2018 school survey, our school scored above 86%, considerably above city average, in 
all indicators of parent involvement in school, with the exception of volunteering time to support the school, which 
received a score of 70%. While this number increased from the previous school year, the Parents' Association is still 
struggling to increase parent involvement at PA sponsored events. Fostering a greater sense of parent involvement 
and voice in helping expose our students to varied career options as part of our overall strategy to foster greater 
college and career readiness is an area that we would like to focus on.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, our school will implement a career day/fair, in collaboration with our SLT and Parents Association, to 
encourage our students to explore career options.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Besides reaching out in our personal and professional networks, we, as an NYU Steinhardt partner school, advertise 
for open positions using NYU’s list serve. We are a member of the university’s network, which gives us access to job 
fairs, etc. and allows us to choose from a varied and highly qualified candidate pool. We have numerous student 
teachers come do their mandatory teaching practicum at our school from NYU and Math for America. As a result, we 
have hired a great number of highly qualified graduates. We are a member of the New York Performance Standards 
Consortium, which provides our teachers with professional development opportunities outside our school in the form 
of subject area workshops, networking and inter-visitations. Moreover, being a member of the consortium means we 
are part of the group’s list serve which allows us to advertise positions to other consortium schools and staff. 

Our school has a hiring committee which follows thoughtfully developed protocols and interview guidelines in our 
search for highly qualified and talented staff. The committee is comprised of the school leadership as well as veteran 
teachers. Qualified candidates must pass though several rigorous stages before being hired. First, candidates are 
screened in a phone interview by a committee member. Subsequently, desirable candidates are invited to a personal 
interview with the committee at the school where they also receive a school tour. Finally, our top candidates are 
invited to demonstrate their teaching abilities and skills interacting with students at a demo lesson. We have found 
that this process has ensured the recruitment of the best possible staff.  

Staff at ESA participates in weekly school wide professional development meetings to discuss, among other things, 
teaching strategies, curriculum design and methods for effectively working with individual students. JumpRope, our 
student information system, allows us to track each individual student’s skill and content mastery across assignments, 
units, semesters, and from year-to-year. We believe that we are able to attract teachers who share our commitment 
to addressing the particular skill and content needs of every student. Staff is also offered the opportunity to take free 
courses at NYU through a partnership we enjoy with New York University’s Steinhardt School of Education. This is 
offered to teachers who wish to obtain certification or extensions in other subject areas or for teachers’ general 
development. 

Additionally, we support teachers at ESA in seeking outside PD opportunities by providing funds for workshops 
offered by the Academy for Teachers, paying for conference fees, etc.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

Finally, school leadership matches teachers’ professional goals with administrative duties agreed upon at the annual 
teacher review, allowing teachers to take ownership of school practices which keep them invested in the school’s 
continual improvement. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Curriculum Review: Departments hold curriculum review meetings in the fall and the spring semesters using Metro 
Learning Communities facilitative leadership protocol. This includes a review of common core aligned scope and 
sequence in departments and a peer review of course curriculum.  

Lesson Plans, Assessments, and Student Work: In departments, teachers together review and analyze lesson plans, 
assessments designed by teachers, and student work, in connection to data on student mastery of skills and content.  

Inquiry Teams: 100% of teachers will engage in inquiry work to pursue a problem of practice unique to their 
classroom using the Beehive protocol. As a part of their inquiry work, teachers will make videos that will be used to 
create a faculty video library to be stored on ESA’s website.  

Jumprope: Jumprope is our student information system used to track student mastery of content and skill standards. 
PD insures that teachers know how to accurately report student mastery of content and skill standards and how to 
use Jumprope to identify student performance on skill and content standards and use this data to inform instructional 
decisions

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
At Essex Street Academy, the ultimate standard for rigor for both teacher and student is the process of completing 
the graduation requirements that have been designed by the teachers, and continually updated, in alignment with the 
New York Performance Assessment Consortium. These performance assessment tasks demand that the students 
demonstrate mastery in discipline specific skills developed over four years of academic work at Essex Street Academy. 
Students complete graduation requirements (PBATs) in Literature, Social Studies, Math, Science, and Art. For each of 
these projects ( an analytical essay in literature, a social studies research paper, an extended or original science 
experiment, problem solving at higher levels of mathematics, and work in a series in art), students complete an 
extensive piece of writing, and an oral defense, presenting their work to a panel made up of teachers, students, and 
an outside evaluator. All of the PBATS are evaluated using Consortium rubrics for writing and oral presentations. This 
rigorous approach demands that students synthesize and apply the content and skills that they have learned in each 
discipline to an authentic task. Further, they must demonstrate mastery “on demand” in front of a group of people. 
Students begin to prepare for these PBATs when they enter ESA.  

At ESA, we work as a staff to ensure that students develop the skills required to complete the graduation 
requirements associated with each academic department. Every course at ESA is designed by ESA’s teachers, using a 
common curriculum plan, which then guides their lesson planning. The plan insures that teachers: construct their 
curriculum using the Habits of Mind as a framework (use of evidence, analysis, making connections, and taking risks), 
design courses around essential questions or inquiry, define skill and content standards that students are expected to 
master, develop PBATs and interim assessments to assess student mastery, differentiate assignments based on 
process, product, and content, and develop lesson plans that ensure that students will develop the content and skill 
standards. Students in grades 9/10 are mastering the skills needed as the foundation for success in senior circle 
courses, while student in grades 11/12 (senior circle) are mastering the skills needed to complete their graduation 
requirements.  

At ESA, we believe students should be challenged intellectually, socially and emotionally. The PBATS, round tables 
(the 9 th and 10 th grade exhibition of student mastery of skill and content), and interim assessments are all designed 
by teachers for students to develop their own opinions and defend their ideas against criticism and questioning. 
Teaching practices, across departments, emphasize the guiding principles of the (now defunct) Coalition of Essential 
Schools and the values of the New York Performance Assessment Consortium , which include depth over breadth, 
student as worker/teacher as coach, demonstration of mastery, active student learning, discussion-based classrooms, 
and student choice. In classrooms, students can be seen working to solve problems, mastering a task, or responding 
to an essential question. As they work to meet our academic standards, students experiment with ideas and have 
opportunities to reflect on their progress independently, with classmates, and with their teachers.  

Teachers track student mastery of skill and content standards using Jumprope, the school’s student information 
system. To meet this goal, teachers enter their assessment data in to Jumprope on an ongoing basis. Teachers then 
track student progress and adjust instruction based on this data. Professional development includes time in faculty 
meeting dedicated to teaching teachers how to accurately report student mastery of content and skill standards using 
Jumprope and on how to use Jumprope to identify student performance on skill and content standards, which then is 
used to drive instruction based on students individual needs.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools

for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Essex Street Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Every Student Succeeds Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Our school will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of our school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent 
Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of our school community. 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person provides parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting 
to all parents. The Parent Coordinator also maintains a log of events and activities planned for parents each month 
and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

Essex Street Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), 
is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
1     The students’ NYSESLAT/NYSITELL  scores are assessed to build curriculum used in each class.  Classes are conducted with 
group and individual activities.  The classroom activities rotate between listening, speaking, writing, and reading skill 
enhancement. The activities involve read aloud activities-group discussions and listening exercises.  The students are grouped 
according to their shared academic classes for focused instruction in their content areas.  Some of the resources that are used 
in the ESL program include but are not limited to The Teaching of Language Arts to Limited English Proficient/ELL: 
•     ESL Practice and Test Preparation-Barrett Kendall Publishing,  
•     A resource Guide for All Teachers 
•     Department of Education Performance Standards for English Language Arts, English as a Second Language, and Spanish 
Language Arts

•     Various audio visual media compiled from the internet used with computer projections and portable lap tops    
•     Computer lab 
  
All resource materials in content area are also used from the Resource Room library.  Students in ESL are asked to share in 
their native language at times to help relate their prior knowledge to teaching in the classroom.  This helps build a platform for 
learning through participation and a sense of involvement.  Multicultural expression is promoted to enhance the students 
experience in language learning.  Lessons in ESL include multicultural input to provide a sense of tolerance and acceptance to 
the many different cultures in New York City Schools and give the students a sense of belonging in the classroom.   
  
We have composed a team of eleven members to execute our Language Allocation Policy (LAP) for 2017-2018 school 
year.  The team members include Principal-Wallace Simpson,  Assistant Principal Nicola Tapino, ELL Coordinator-Denise 
Petrillo, Classroom Teacher-John Shafer,  Classroom Teacher-Caitlin Thomas, Classroom Teacher- Stacy Blair, Classroom 
Teacher-Monique Velazques, Related Service Provider- Alex Schmerge, Parent Coordinator- Gabriel Fermin, Social Worker- 
Jennifer McCue, and Parent Katherine Mechner .  The  designated ESL teacher is  John Shafer. 
The Language Allocation Policy Team is optimistic about our mission of securing all requirements for our ELL students. We will 
continue to use collaboration within our ESL department to cultivate new learning strategies that are both appealing and 
engaging for our students.  The team will meet once a month to plan meaningful professional development for the staff and to 
discuss student progress.  ESL Teachers will be urged to attend regional workshops to advance their mastery of ESL skills and to 
review resources and materials from other locations and DOE approved vendors for use in our school.  The ESL department 
will review and update their annual CEP entries to ensure that the best possible ESL education will be offered to our ELL 
students.            
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
The students’ NYSESLAT/NYSITELL  scores are assessed to build curriculum used in each class.  Classes are conducted with 
group and individual activities.  The classroom activities rotate between listening, speaking, writing, and reading skill 
enhancement. The activities involve read aloud activities-group discussions and listening exercises.  The students are grouped

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 Students in the higher grades perform(10th &11th  grade) better on school assignments than students who are in the lower 
grade.(9th grade).   The teachers use a great deal of variation in the curriculum and instruction that ELL students receive, by 
grade level, by type of ELL program or general education program.  Student perform better when lessons in ESL include

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

1. The organizational models followed at Essex Street Academy are a combination of push-ins and pull-outs from both 
General and CTT classes.  The classes are comprised of students of mixed proficiency levels.  To ensure that the 
mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels, the ESL teacher meets with the 
team to develop a schedule that accommodates the mandated minutes.  Per CR Part 154.2, Beginning ESL students 
receive 580 minutes of ESL instruction 3 units per week; Low Intermediate  ESL students receive 360  minutes of ESL 
instruction 2 units per week; Intermediate/Advanced students receive 180 minutes of ESL instruction 1unit per week; 
and Proficient students continue to receive ESL instruction for two year after they have reach the proficient level.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not applicable    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Not applicable    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           In order to best serve our ESL students while maintaining appropriate relevancy to the content areas, the ESL teacher 
meets with the team and the department coordinators to develop a comprehensive curriculum which both addresses the 
content being covered in class as well as adapts and modifies content when necessary.  As Essex Street Academy provides a 
free- standing ESL program to its ESL population, the majority of instruction is delivered in English.             
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Essex Street Academy uses a hands-on workshop model in ELA that provides students with the opportunity to explore 
literacy in both reading and writing across content areas.  Through the use of targeted mini- lessons and conferring, students 
are assisted in developing and enhancing their skills as readers and writers so that they may meet the Standards of becoming 
independent, self- directed learners.  To ensure that ELL students receive the instruction they need to advance, students are 
given both formal and informal assessments to determine their strengths and needs.  They also receive small- group targeted 
instruction to support their learning.  In addition, ELL students use multi- media tools to enhance their understanding of 
vocabulary, reading and writing.  Technology aids such as Smart Boards, Google Docs, word processors, Power Point 
presentations and videos contribute to building strong literacy skills. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

   The ELL Coordinator schedules the students to be tested by native language during the two week test administration period 
and ensures that the proper accommodations are in place.  Our ESL curriculum is tailored towards individualized instruction, 
addressing student strengths and weaknesses in their native language as well as english.  Additionally, students take part in 
formal monthly summative assessments ensuring the parallel of student performance with that of the stated grade level 
expectations.            
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

.  Differentiated instruction is acknowledged amongst ELL subgroups.  To ensure learner success, each student is assessed by 
the ELL Coordinator and team teachers, and his or her needs are identified.  Teachers work in small groups with these students 
to provide the necessary instruction for meaningful, autonomous learning.  Our staff is trained in using differentiation 
strategies and tools to support students at the various levels. We offer core and elective courses that challenge students to 
develop their own ideas. With an emphasis on project-based learning, students spend their four years developing a portfolio 
that best reflects their intellectual growth. Students learn the skill of making an argument supported by evidence by doing: 
designing and conducting experiments, developing a historical thesis, analyzing works of literature through a critical lens, 
developing mathematical solutions and proofs to problems encountered. We believe in developing students’ ability to apply 
sophisticated skills to solve complex problems. Our students are active, not passive, and will graduate from our school 
confident in their ability to tackle any problem they encounter. 
  
We also use effective methods and instructional strategies that are based on scientifically-based research that targets all ELL 
subgroups: 
a.  Increase the amount and quality of learning time, such as extended school year, before- and after-school and summer 
programs and opportunities are given to SIFE. 
b.The instructional day at ESA is longer than mandated.  We offer tutoring and enrichment activities after and before school 
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  We also run our own credit recovery summer program for our students, who new 
to the country,  run by ESA staff.  
c.   Students who are receiving 4-6 years of ELL service have small class sizes during the year, and even smaller class sizes 
during the summer, and the extended school day allows teachers to give students personalized attention and help students 
make the connection to school and learning that helps them to achieve success. 
d.  Teachers design curriculum at ESA to prepare students who have completed 6 or more years of ELL service for success at 
the college level.  Curriculum is designed backwards from state standards of expectations at the graduation level and is 
scaffolded to ensure that students are developing the proper content mastery, and skill development along the way. 
e.  The ESL and Former ELL teachers meet to plan lessons and identify specific strategies to be used to support the 
development of the skills needed for these students.    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 The teacher serves as the student’s academic counselor and is in contact with the family when the student seems to need 
additional support.The classroom activities rotate between listening, speaking, writing, and reading skill enhancement. The 
activities involve read aloud activities-group discussions and listening exercises.  The students are grouped according to their 
shared academic classes for focused instruction in their content areas.  Some of the resources that are used in the ESL program 
include but are not limited to The Teaching of Language Arts to Limited English Proficient/ELL: 
•     ESL Practice and Test Preparation-Barrett Kendall Publishing,  
•     A resource Guide for All Teachers 
•      Department of Education Performance Standards for English Language Arts, English as a Second Language, and Spanish 
Language Arts  
•     Various audio visual media compiled from the internet used with computer projections and portable lap tops

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The ESL and Special needs teachers meet to plan lessons and identify specific strategies to be used to support the 
development of the skills needed for students with special needs.  
  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
1. Push in/pull out services provided by teachers as mandated by CR Part 154.2 and student performance. 
 2. Every student in the school has an advisor who meets with the students in small groups several times a week.  The advisor 
serves as the student’s academic counselor and is in contact with the family should the student seem to need additional 
support. 
3.After and before school, small group tutoring, provided by teachers, for 150 minute sessions, 4 days a week.  Students 
needing extra support will be mandated for tutoring by subject teachers, and/or advisors in consultation with students and 
families. 
    Our school provides opportunities for all ELL children to meet the State's proficient and advanced levels of student academic 
achievement. 
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We have opened, with the help of the Greenwich Village Youth Council and NYU, a community center in the school building on 
weekends.  The community center offers ESL families centralized, and familiar access to a variety of social services.  In addition 
to academic and social activities, the community center offers family counseling in Spanish and English at the school on an as-
needed basis. Additionally, Educational software will be considered for the upcoming school year.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs will be discontinued. 
  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 ELL students are offered equal access to all school programs.  They also receive ESL services from a licensed ESL teacher and 
are targeted for small group instruction that supports their learning.              
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Technology and multi- media is used in various modalities to enhance teaching.  A school- wide online supportive website is 
used to help students understand and keep track of their assignments.  An online language program, is used to build 
understanding of language.  Schools  assessments help ELL students understand their strengths and assist students in meeting 
challenges.  Formal and informal assessments are used to identify ELL students’ needs and in consultation with the ESL 
teacher, classroom teachers confer with ESL students about these needs to support growth.  Academic intervention services, 
such as Wilson, Rewards and Just Words,  are offered and students are programmed for small group instruction to support 
their learning.           
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

As  ESA provides a free- standing ESL program to its ESL population, the majority of instruction is delivered in 
English.  Additionally,  
during the regular school day ESA offers Spanish and French language electives courses that challenge students to develop 
their own ideas.    
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required services support and resources correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Technology and multi- media is used in various modalities to enhance teaching.  A school- wide online supportive website is 
used to help students understand and keep track of their assignments.  An online language program, is used to build 
understanding of language.  Schools  assessments help ELL students understand their strengths and assist students in meeting 
challenges.  Formal and informal assessments are used to identify ELL students’ needs and in consultation with the ESL 
teacher, classroom teachers confer with ESL students about these needs to support growth.  Academic intervention services, 
such as Wilson, Rewards and Just Words,  are offered and students are programmed for small group instruction to support 
their learning.           
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Students entering the ELL program are given the Home Language Survey.  This is followed by the NYSITELL and the Spanish 
NYSITELL (Hispanic students). Parent Orientation is offered to ELL students twice a year.  The orientation is presented once in 
the fall and once in the spring.  Parents are requested to fill out the Parent Survey and Selection Form.  Parents are instructed 
about the different programs offered by the Department of Education including Transitional Bilingual Education and Dual 
Language, and given the opportunity to place their children in other environments if requested.  Parents with students who 
have already been enrolled in ELL education complete a Continued Entitlement Form.  Translation services are used from the 
DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit as needed.  These services provide telephone translation or document 
translation.  Our school is only able to offer ESL instruction but can make arrangements for students whose parents request a 
different instructional environment.  Newly admitted students/parents are given the same materials if they enroll between 
orientation periods by our orientation staff.           
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

During the regular school day ESA offers Spanish and French language electives and after school we plan to offer Italian and 
Portuguese courses that challenge students to develop their own ideas. Our school has an emphasis on project-based learning, 
students spend their four years developing a portfolio that best reflects their intellectual growth.     
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
  In addition to the professional development taking place at the department level, staff at ESA also participate in weekly 
school wide professional development meetings to discuss teaching strategies, curriculum design, and methods for effectively 
working with individual students, among other things.  ESA also belongs to the locally based Consortium of Performance Based 
schools.  Teachers from all of these schools meet monthly in departments to share work across the schools and reflect on best

practices.  ESA also belongs to the national Coalition of Essential Schools affording our teachers opportunities to share with 
educators from around the country who share a similar philosophy at national meetings.  Our partnership with Facing History 
and Ourselves gives teachers additional professional development opportunities with teachers from other schools. Also, our 
partnership with NYU has enabled us to bring student teachers to our school on a regular basis, most of whom want to work 
here.  We have worked with Teach for America to find qualified applicants when needed. 
  
We have opened, with the help of the Greenwich Village Youth Council and NYU, a community center in the school building on 
weekends.  The community center offers ESL families centralized, and familiar access to a variety of social services.  In addition 
to academic and social activities, the community center offers family counseling in Spanish and English at the school on an as-
needed basis. 
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
At  ESA, all students’ especially 9  th   graders  projects are collected in individual student portfolios that are constantly 
reviewed and monitored by students’ advisors.  The data specialist also maintains a database on the progress of each student 
in the school in completion of their promotional and graduation requirements.  Individual teachers track student progress and 
skills development through the use of rubrics.  Therefore, ELL academic progress and English language development is 
constantly being monitored.   
          
.  Our staff is trained in using differentiation strategies and tools to support students at the various levels. We offer core and 
elective courses that challenge students to develop their own ideas. With an emphasis on project-based learning, students 
spend their four years developing a portfolio that best reflects their intellectual growth. Students learn the skill of making an 
argument supported by evidence by doing: designing and conducting experiments, developing a historical thesis, analyzing

in developing students’ ability to apply sophisticated skills to solve complex problems. Our students are active, not passive, and 
will graduate from our school confident in their ability to tackle any problem they encounter.   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
  The families of ELL students are invited to school activities by their children, or telephone translators, or written notification 
by translation.  The families of the students are encouraged to join the PTA, School Leadership Team, or any school 
committees to bring their voice into the schools arena.  Some of the ELL parents are attending the student performances but 
they have yet to be involved in any of the school committees.  Native language resources are available in Spanish and we are 
currently updating our library to meet the needs of the other ELL students. Professional development includes the sharing of 
information about students among faculty and being aware of ELL classification of students. The staff wants everyone to be 
sure that teachers are using basic literacy skills in classrooms which ELL students attend to help promote their academic 
growth.     

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

The teacher serves as the student’s academic counselor and is in contact with the family when the student seems to need

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Wallace Simpson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Upon entering the NYCDOE, students are given the Home Language Survey. The Home Language Survey is an 
instrument that determines the student status as language minority, and home language translation needs. 
Records are maintained in ATS and are used to determine which parents are in need of translation services. 

In addition to the introductory assessments, a parent orientation is offered to parents during the fall and the 
spring of each year. The orientation presents and opportunity for parents to fill out a Parent Survey and Selection 
Form and become acquainted with the variety of programs that are offered by the Department of Education, such 
as the Transitional Bilingual Education and Dual Language programs. The orientations also give the school the 
opportunity to identify parents that are in need of translation services that may not have been identified by the 
Home Language Survey for one reason or another. If parents were not identified by the survey, or during the 
orientation, advisors are able to identify translation needs through frequent contact with the families of their 
advisees. Once translation services are identified as being needed they are shared with the administrative office 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

that ensures that documents and oral communications are shared with the family in the target language as 
needed. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

           After students have successfully 
enrolled at Essex Street Academy, mono-
lingual parents who are not fluent in 
English are directed to complete a 
Continued Entitlement Form which will 
furnish them with translation and 
interpretation services offered by the 
DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit. 
These services provide telephone 
translation and/or document translation, 
whenever the school is not able to 
provide them. 

Such an itinerary of parental 
introduction is the standard procedure 
throughout the New York City 
Department of Education. At Essex 
Street Academy, we have instituted such 
protocol for ELL students and have 
manifested a firm commitment towards 
maintaining communication with our 
diverse parent body. Most parents 
prefer both written and oral 
communication in their native language, 
which are currently spanish, Chinese. 

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

None 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

     Parents are notified of their rights to translation services in target languages as identified through the processes 
outlined in Part A, section 1, above, through a mailing in the beginning of the school year and through an initial 
orientation at the start of each semester. Posters in main administrative offices inform parents of their right to 
translation services, and indicate what steps need to be taken to gain access to those services should they desire 
them.  

       
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

When registering students new to the NYC public school system, parents fill out the Home Language Identification 
Survey (HLIS) which includes an informal oral interview in English and, when appropriate, in the native language (if 
other than English). The ELL Coordinator conducts the initial screening and administers the HLIS. When necessary, the 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

translation services of in- house staff members fluent in the home language have been utilized. In other instances, the 
coordinator contacts the NYC DOE’s Over the Phone Translation Services to facilitate this process. 

If the responses indicate that a student may be an ELL, the coordinator administers the NYSITELL, a test used to 
determine initial entitlement. The NYSITELL is administered within the first ten days of school or within the first ten 
days of enrollment in the NYC public school system, the ELL Coordinator and the Parent Coordinator set up a meeting 
for those parents whose children have scored below proficiency on the NYSITELL. Parents are instructed about the 
different programs offered by the Department of Education including Transitional Bilingual Education, Dual Language 
and Freestanding ESL, and given the opportunity to place their children in other environments if requested. It is 
explained to the parents that our school is only able to offer ESL instruction but can make arrangements for students 
whose parents request a different instructional environment. The students’ NYSESLAT scores are assessed to build 
curriculum used in each class. Classes are conducted with group and individual activities. The classroom activities 
rotate between listening, speaking, writing, and reading skill enhancement.
