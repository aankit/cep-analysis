Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

In support of our school vision and mission, it is our pledge to: 

 

 

 

 

Support close communication between home and school that ensures greater parent/guardian 
involvement. 

  Expose and engage students in the use of modern technologies that support the literacy and 

communication skills required of the 21st Century College and Career ready student.  

  Provide and encourage ongoing professional development opportunities for our faculty and staff. 
  Encourage and promote student involvement in local and global issues through rigorous and relevant 

classroom instruction, activities, clubs and experiential learning opportunities. 

  Encourage lifelong fitness and health awareness. 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Staten Island Technical High School is a highly challenging New York City public high school, established in 1988. In 
September 2005, Staten Island Technical High School was granted status as New York City’s seventh Specialized High 
School by the NYC Department of Education, joining schools such as Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Technical High School, 
serving the needs of New York City’s most gifted and talented young men and women. 

Staten Island Technical High School’s mission seeks to preserve its long-standing tradition of academic excellence as 
evidenced by our school’s continuing success as a College and Career Preparatory Institution. Staten Island Technical 
High School's rich program of study prepares students with the extensive knowledge and 21st Century skills necessary 
to succeed in their post-secondary education, future careers and role in the community. 

Our school places a high priority on academics and developing exemplary character, scholarship, service, leadership, 
and citizenship, while cultivating innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship. Formative and individualized pedagogy 
with real-time feedback utilizing modern assessment tools are used to measure and improve student performance in 
and out of the classroom. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Having a student population of Gifted and Talented learners, who are academically-mindful, extremely-motivated and 
goal-oriented with high expectations for their post-secondary career, challenges our school to foster an academic 
culture that strikes the right balance between the importance of Staten Island Tech’s college and career preparatory 
education, while maintaining daily practices that allow for greater awareness to support social, emotional, physical 
and academic needs of students, to support learning. 

Over the past few years, the SITHS School Leadership Team has been reflecting on our success as a school community 
and has been analyzing the challenges and impact that accompany this success. We have also been evaluating the 
degree of preparedness of students entering in the 9th grade at Staten Island Tech and how that plays a role in their 
success and the challenges that are presented to them early on. 

As a school for gifted and talented learners, with nearly 30 years of school culture and history, the School Leadership 
Team made suggestions to transition towards letter grades and unweight the cumulative transcript GPA based upon 
an analysis of the Learning Environment Survey, Social Emotional Guidance Data and student, parent and faculty 
feedback.

New Schoolwide Academic Policy with a Shift Towards Unweighted GPA and Letter Grades  

 

Shifting towards Letter Grades and the Unweighted GPA 

As per the research, findings and recommendations of the Staten Island Technical High School School Leadership 
Team, starting in the 2017-2018 school year, faculty shifted from using numeric grades to letter grades, in the spirit of 
better aligning to how colleges assign grades, and to also de-emphasize the point-for-point emphasis that the numeric 
system facilitates.  

A NEW Academic Grading Scale for the 2017-2018 school year was submitted to the NYC DOE Central Offices and was 
approved, in which we requested a modification to the Actual Mark, Range and Numerical Equivalent, to better serve 
the Staten Island Tech student community with a grading scale that better suits the rigor of the curriculum, without 
weighting the classes individually. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2017-2018 Focus and Progress: 

 

EFFECTIVE SCHOOL LEADERSHIP: During the 2017-2018 school year, great strides were made in transitioning to letter 
grades, piloting Mastery Based Learning practices and instituting a Universal Grading policy.  

 

Staten Island Technical High School shifted towards having only two grade categories to chart student progress 
with all Academic Data falling into one of two “categories” in the spirit and philosophy that “Everything Counts.” 
All forms of academic work, such as Formative / Summative Assessments (Quizzes / Tests), Classwork, Homework, 
Projects, Papers, Lab Reports, etc … anything that measures student learning, is all equal in importance, no matter 
the subject area or discipline.  

 

The “Learning Progress” category (Worth 85% of Class Grade) is designed to track a student’s progress towards 
achieving content mastery. Measures and indicators of “qualitative” progress is the focus of this category, not 
quantitative credit awarded for completed work. We are shifting our practice away from measuring student 
progress categorically, towards a means that emphasizes the “process” of learning. Students will have multiple 
opportunities to “showcase” understanding (Mastery) via “qualitative” measures. 

The “Habits of Success” category (Worth 15% of Class Grade) marks a unified approach as a school towards building 
a set of 6 skills that have been identified as integral for successful Academic Performance (Academic Behaviors, 
Academic Perseverance, Academic Mindsets, Learning Strategies and Social Skills)  

 

2018-2019 Focus: To further enhance the new Universal Grading Policy system that introduced new learning 
practices / opportunities and introduced the Habits of Success (in place of traditional Class Participation categories) 
as a school wide component of every teacher's grading policy, placing a unified effort focusing on specific (life

from our college and professional partners, whom work with our students during and after their secondary school 
experience. 

STRONG FAMILY - COMMUNITY TIES: During the 2017-2018 school year, we further expanded our Career 
Development Center efforts to further capitalize and build upon pre-existing community partnerships through our 
school’s Career and Technical Education program and College and Career Readiness initiative. 

● Work Based Learning Initiative – The key area of focus for the 2017-18 school year centered on the expansion of 
connecting classroom academic experiences with potential career pathways via Staten Island Tech’s Career 
Development Center (CDC). The CDC offered numerous opportunities each week, for students of all grade levels, 
with the ability to explore various career pathways, via our “Backpack to Briefcases” series, which featured daily 
presentations from outside guests, as well as work shops, internships, and other Work-Based Learning 
opportunities. 

 

● VISIT Program (K-16 Pipeline) – SI Tech's V.I.S.I.T. Program (Visit Inside Staten Island Tech) is our District wide K-
16 Pipeline Program, in which 5th and 7th graders from corresponding feeder elementary and middle schools, visit 
SI Tech for a 4-hour STEAM experience (which includes an SHSAT overview and Spec HS Admissions session). The 
VISIT is facilitated by 9th grade SI Tech student ambassadors who are alumni of the visiting elementary and middle 
Schools, along with a presentation from a SI Tech alumnus who is currently attending CSI (30,000 Degrees 
Initiative). The VISIT program enables 5th + 7th + 9th + 14th graders to interact and inspire one another, realizing 
the K-16 pipeline, increasing High School awareness / readiness, while familiarizing students with the Specialized 
High Schools /SHSAT admissions process. SUMMER STEAM CAMP: SI Tech’s VISIT program is now a part of the UAU 
summer program at SI Tech. The VISIT component of the UAU summer camp is the STEAM Camp. The STEAM Camp 
offers students an opportunity to get involved in project-based learning in Computer Assisted Design (CAD), 
Robotics, Television Production and Sound Design, alongside traditional summer camp activities. SHSAT Test Prep is 
available for those students who wish to attend a Specialized High School. 

● Summer Internships – During the summer (of 2017), as a major part of our Career Development Center’s Work 
Based Learning initiative, Staten Island Tech executed our 3rd Summer Internship Program, funded by the Summer 
Youth Employment Program (SYEP). 42% of the entire SI Tech student population participated and identified 
"career interests" which were matched with internships that closely matched the experiences and career-related 
skill-sets. Some students were placed at campsites and school settings that provided challenging and exciting work 
experiences that cultivated character and professional skills, while earning an income as well. For the summer of 
2017-18 school year we continued to maintain the number of original internships (from 2017) by servicing over 40% 
of our students, with summer jobs closely aligned to their desired career path. 

 

2018-2019 Focus: Continue to build upon and expand our Work Based Learning, VISIT and Internship programs 
through experiential learning experiences and the cultivation of entrepreneurship, leadership, character and 
scholarship. Students will be more engaged in the professional community to better inform their academic journey 
and goal setting, in preparation for their post-secondary school career. Community Based Organizations will be 
pushing into our academic program to provide Mock College and Job Interviews to all 11th graders, in addition to 
the annual Soft Skills training that students receive. A 9th Grade 21st Century Skills program will be instituted for 
90% or more of the Class of 2022. 

 

We will continue to expand upon translating additional school communications into multiple-languages, in the 
interest of engaging more of our parents / families.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Based on an analysis of 2018 Regents passing and mastery data, 98.88% achieved a passing grade, which is 2739 of 
the 2770 total Regents exams taken. Of the 2770 exams taken, 2128 (which is 76.82% of the total exams taken) were 
at a mastery level. There was a 9% average decrease within subject mastery for 3 of the 10 Regent exams, while the 
remaining 7 Regents reflected a 15% average increase in mastery level. This data reflects an overall consistent trend 
from the benchmark of passing compared to 2017 Regents passing and mastery data, where 99.18% of the students 
passed all 10 Regents examinations, and there was a 13% average decrease within subject mastery for 5 of the 10 
Regents exam. 

During the 2017 – 2018 school year, it was expected that 70% (7 out of 10) of the following “Performance Sub-
Targets” would be achieved, where students achieve Mastery (85 or higher on the respective Regents examination). 
Below are the results of the 2017-2018 Regents Data, with 8 of the 10 performance sub targets met: 

  Common Core English Regents: 2017 goal was 70% Mastery, we achieved 99% Mastery. 
  Global History Regents: 2017 goal was 75% Mastery, we achieved 78% Mastery. 
  US History & Government Regents: 2017 goal was 80% Mastery, we achieved 95% Mastery. 
  Russian LOTE: 2017 goal was 80% Mastery, we achieved 85% Mastery. 
  Common Core Algebra Regents: 2017 goal was 50% Mastery, we achieved 78% Mastery. 
  Common Core Geometry Regents: 2017 goal was 75% Mastery, we achieved 70% Mastery. (Not Met) 
  Common Core Algebra 2/Trig Regents: 2017 goal was 50% Mastery, we achieved 67% Mastery. 
 
  Chemistry Regents: 2017 goal was 65% Mastery, we achieved 58% Mastery. (Not Met) 
  Physics Regents: 2017 goal was 50% Mastery, we achieved 62% Mastery. 

Living Environment Regents:2017 goal was 85% Mastery, we achieved 94% Mastery. 

Our school received a Quality Review (QR) in 2014-2015. Based on the most recent QR report in 2016-17, our school 
received a “Proficient” for QR Indicator – Assessment. The report stated that, “All teachers track, monitor and analyze 
student progress, using a Learning Management System (Skedula / Pupil Path) and Google Docs for Education as well 
as digital assessment tools such as Nearpod, TurnItIn.com. One teacher at the teacher team meeting described how 
members of the Pupil Personnel and Academic Intervention Services teams tap into the data regularly, providing 
additional support for any student whose data shows that he or she is not yet meeting academic targets.” 

 
Informed by the Capacity Framework Element – Rigorous Instruction, current data tracking practices, and analysis 
supports that efforts and strategies integrated to raise the mastery level of students has been successful on a yearly 
basis, yet a deeper item analysis of the Science and Mathematics Regents results has identified topics that were

challenging for students, which accounts for the increase in mastery for these subject areas. The needs assessment 
informed the development of the annual goals listed below. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
During the 2018 – 2019 school year, it is expected that at least 70% (7 out of 10) of the following “Performance Sub-
Targets” will be achieved, where students achieve Mastery (85 or higher on the respective Regents examination):

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Based on an analysis of the 2017-2018 NYC School Learning Environment Survey, SITHS received a positive feedback 
index of 85% (previously 87%) with students feeling supported and challenged academically, while in terms of 
Personal Attention & Support, SITHS received a positive feedback index of 69% (previously 75%) where students felt 
supported academically and social emotionally. This data reflects an overall 8% decrease as compared to to the 2016-
2017 Learning Environment Survey. 

Our school did receive a Quality Review (QR) in 2014-2015. Based on the most recent QR report in 2015, our school 
received a “Well Developed” within a Quality Indicator 3.4 – High Expectations, which addressed our school’s 
attention towards a “Supportive Environment.” The report stated that, “All students are immersed in ongoing 
exploration of opportunities outside of the classroom, connected to career goals that they develop with their 
teachers, parents-guardian, guidance counselor and college Informed by the Capacity Framework Element – 
Supportive Environment, current data, and our most recent Learning Environment Survey and QR, there is a strong 
indication that students feel “safe, supported and challenged;” however, in an effort to close any remaining gaps and 
sustain the high-level of support services offered, while accounting for a continually increasing student population 
and guidance counselor caseloads, additional pupil personnel services are needed. This needs assessment informed 
the development of the annual goal listed below. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By the end of June 2019, link 100% of the 9th grade student History class sections to their respective guidance 
counselor, allowing for a monthly Advisory Class Meeting for all 9th grade students.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
We recognized that many SITHS families (as of 2018, 43% of which live in Brooklyn) need to make plans well in 
advance, sometimes as far as one year ahead of time, in addition to speak / understand and communicate in a 
number of different languages. Through our Bi-Weekly Parent in the Know Newsletter (goo.gl/2oieAh), we regularly 
implement extensive efforts to make clearer communications as to daily and upcoming events and new initiatives in 
addition to and especially, when school is closed, so meaningful “family time” could be scheduled. This newsletter is 
also used to communicate important opportunities and resources that are available to students, parents/guardians 
and families throughout the school year so there is equity and access to attend special meetings and events, which 
are also accompanied by interpreters in the multiple languages that re prevalent in our school community. Our Parent 
Coordinator / Language Access Coordinator and AP of PPS directly handle these communications, the proper 
translation and delivery / follow-up that occurs. 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 
Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
1. District support regarding HR Teacher hiring process (for CTE Work Based Learning Coordinator position). 

2. Scheduling weekly PPS / College Office Professional Development and Planning Meetings 

3. Guidance counselors are available throughout the day as determined via scheduling under the supervision of the 
AP PPS-Security, and will conduct personal interviews with their entire respective caseload.

4. Attend district, city, and BFSC professional development sessions relative to PPS – School Safety. 

5. Set up a peer- mentor program whereby students are matched up to assist in both social and academic needs.  

6. The dean of the school will work collaboratively with the Guidance Office in using the ladder of discipline: The dean 
will analyze students’ previous dean referrals and evaluate past guidance interventions. 

7. The Dean’s and Guidance offices work collaboratively with students and parents/guardians (in a parent meeting 
forum) to discuss possible interventions to obviate discipline-code violating behavior.  

8. Align funds and provide support for PPS faculty to attend district, city, Comfort Dog professional development 
sessions, if accepted into the program for 2017-2018.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on an analysis of 2017-2018 Master Program, 100% of the teachers were scheduled with common teacher 
planning time on a departmental level. The limitations of programming made it a challenge to schedule departmental 
professional development and planning time during and after the school day, decreasing the likeliness of the 
opportunities to promote teacher-to-teacher collaboration outside of their subject-area departments. 

Based on two years worth of data via the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, under the category of 
Collaborative Teachers - Quality of Professional Development, SITHS increased the Percent Positive Index by 3%, from 
74% to 77%, respectively. A combination of aligning departmental common planning time and the inclusion of the 
Teacher Leadership Program - Peer Collaborative Teacher initiative and more effective and teacher-centric, needs-
based professional development, our school continues to improve in this area, but with a great desire to continue to 
improve. 

Informed by the Capacity Framework Element – Collaborative Teachers, our most recent School Quality Guide and an 
analysis of the 2018-2019 Master Program, the data supports that a maximal percentage of teachers within a 
departmental subject-level should be scheduled with Teacher Common Planning Time with their fellow subject-level 
teachers, Peer Collaborative Teacher(s) as well as their supervisor. The needs assessment informed the development 
of the annual goal listed below. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of all 64 departmental subject-level teachers’ schedules will include Teacher Common Planning 
Time, lead by administration, SITHS's Peer Collaborative Teachers and 3rd party vendors, to provide support around 
achieving the 2018-2019 Instructional Focus of incorporating instructional practices which cultivates 21st Century 
Global Skills in & outside of the classroom.

support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Having a student population of Gifted and Talented learners, who are academically-mindful, extremely-motivated and 
goal-oriented with high expectations for their post-secondary career, challenges our school to foster an academic 
culture that strikes the right balance between the importance of Staten Island Tech’s college and career preparatory 
education, while maintaining daily practices that allow for greater awareness to support social, emotional, physical 
and academic needs of students, to support learning. 

Over the 2016-2017 school year, the Staten Island Tech's School Leadership Team has been reflecting on our success 
as a school community and has been analyzing the challenges and impact that accompany this success.  

As a school for gifted and talented learners, with nearly 30 years of school culture and history, after much research, 
analysis and discussion the School Leadership Team made suggestions to transition towards letter grades and 
unweight the cumulative transcript GPA based upon an analysis of the Learning Environment Survey, Social Emotional 
Guidance Data , as well as student, parent and faculty feedback. An analysis of Academic / Social Emotional Culture 
revealed trends related to: 

Students’ Heavy Focus on Grades / Numbers as indicators for success 

  Academic Related Stress: High School Preparedness; Course Workload; Assessments 
 
  Peer : Peer Competition 
 

Suicidal Ideations connected to stress 

In an effort to address these challenges and better inform the decision making process as we move towards the 2017-
2018 school year, the SLT conducted an analysis of the Learning Environment Survey, Social Emotional Guidance Data 
, as well as student, parent and faculty feedback. As per the research, findings and recommendations of the Staten 
Island Technical High School School Leadership Team, starting in the 2017-2018 school year, faculty will shift from 
using numeric grades to letter grades, in the spirit of better aligning to how colleges assign grades, and to also de-
emphasize the point-for-point emphasis that the numeric system provides.  

 

A new Academic Grading Scale for the 2017-2018 school year was submitted to the NYC DOE Central offices and 
approved in which we requested a modification to the Actual Mark, Range and Numerical Equivalent, to better serve 
the Staten Island Tech student community with a grading scale that better aligns the rigor of the curriculum, without 
weighting the classes individually (starting with 9th graders only). The needs assessment informed the development

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How  will  your  school  engage  parents/families  and  support  their  understanding  of  Effective  School  Leadership  and 
strategies  to  promote  parent  leadership  and  engagement  in  order  to  support  their  children  at  home?  Include  the 
timeline and identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
Via our digital online Learning Management System (IO Education) and Digital communication practices, all students 
and parents have 24 /7 access to teacher / administrator email communication, Academic Grading Policies, syllabi and 
student progress indicators, shared in real-time in an effort to better inform each family of their child's progress. The 
Our Parent Coordinator / Language Access Coordinator regularly ensures (daily) that every parent is registered and 
using our Learning Management System, as well as is versed in using it properly and understands what the data and 
feedback represents and especially has knowledge and training on using the "translation" features within the system. 
Through our Bi-Weekly Parent in the Know Newsletter (goo.gl/2oieAh), we regularly implement extensive efforts to 
make clearer communications as to daily and upcoming events and new initiatives. This newsletter is also used to 
communicate important opportunities and resources that are available to students, parents/guardians and families 
throughout the school year so there is equity and access to attend special meetings and events, which are also 
accompanied by interpreters in the multiple languages that re prevalent in our school community. Our Parent

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on an analysis of year's worth of home language statistics from 2006 - 2018 for Staten Island Technical High 
School, there has been a major increase in the number of families whose home language is designated as Asian from 
13% to nearly 478. In an effort to address the rising demand for aligned translation and interpretation services, the 
2017-2018 school year included an array of services that created multiple translated versions of key documents and 
communications, in addition to including interpretive services for key school and PTA meetings. 

The 2016-2017 Academic Wellness Proposal Survey served as a means to better identify school community challenges 
and better inform the decision making process as we move towards the 2018-2019 school year. As the SLT conducted 
an analysis of the 2016-2017 Academic Wellness Proposal Survey for the Staten Island Technical High School 
community, student and parent-guardian feedback supported the statistical evidence that more support was needed 
to meet the rising demand for more interpretation and translation services. Students, parents-guardians, faculty and 
staff are encouraged to employ and use these services when sharing their voice and views on school related issues 
and concerns. The needs assessment informed the development of the annual goal listed below. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
During the 2018 - 2019 School Year, on a bi-weekly basis the Language Access Coordinator will meet with School 
Administration Cabinet to continually update the Communications Calendar to better identify key events that require 
Translation / Interpretation services for various school media and content targeted for parents.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Staten Island Technical High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Staten Island Technical High School will support parents-guardians and families by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and technology use; 

● providing parents-guardians with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning 
and decision-making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents-guardians in understanding city, state, and federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

● sharing information about school and parent-guardian related programs, meetings, and other activities in a format, 
and in languages that parents-guardians can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents-guardians to 
improve outreach, communication skills, and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community. 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based on a careful assessment of the needs of all parents-
guardians, including parents-guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The school 
community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent-guardian involvement 
policy with parents-guardians to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through 
school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, 
and enhance the school’s program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Parent Involvement Policy, parent-guardian members of the school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as 
well as parent-guardian members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Parent 
Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and improve parent-guardian 
involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● support school-level committees that include parents-guardians who are members of the School Leadership Team 
and the Parent Teacher Association. This includes providing technical support and ongoing professional development, 
especially in developing leadership skills;  

● Maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator or a 
dedicated staff person will provide parent-guardian workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children 
who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents-
guardians. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents-guardians each 
month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent-guardian workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support 
services; and technology training to build parents’-guardians' capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 
schedule additional parent-guardian meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings 
in the morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives 
of the Chancellor and allow parents-guardians to provide suggestions; 

 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Currently we have only one student being serviced in his second year beyond the NYSESLAT exam. Initially with the results of 
the NYSESLAT, combined Modality Report (RNMR) from ATS, along with the NY Measures of Student Learning – Baseline exam, 
and teacher feedback based on work inside the English classroom, Mrs. Sanguinedo along with Mrs. Dobry our ENL and foreign 
language teacher and the Freshman English Teacher Team were able to pinpoint focus areas that ELL students needed 
additional assistance with these included but were not limited to:  note taking, vocabulary, writing conventions and speaking. 
Each week, Mrs. Dobry and Mrs. Lane would meet to review the student's level of mastery in a specific skill set in order to plan 
differentiated target lessons.  This coming year the same meetings will occur to ensure continuity and growth. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

Common planning time is built into our schedule in order to accommodate teacher team meetings such that Mrs. Dobry, Mrs. 
Lane, and Mr. Misciagna can meet to discuss all aspects of mastery skills and what students must achieve, as well as possible 
limitations.  Additionally, if need be, Mrs. Barnett will also be made during the same period so that she can be constantly 
updated on the student's progress.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Success for our ELLs is measured through periodic assessment in their ENL class as well as assessment of how goals are met 
and how long students take to meet those goals.  With these short term goals achieved it will be easier for students to test out 
when taking the NYSESLAT in Mid-April.  Additionally, within the classroom environment, students are given goal setting 
exercises through a Mastery Based approach new to Staten Island Tech this year, in which they master specific skill sets with 
each given task throughout the term.  In this way, students are able to see in a more focused manner what they might struggle 
with and therefore work on skills with Mrs. Dobry and their English teacher in a more targeted fashion for greater success and 
improvement. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once data is collected to specifically identify the strengths and weaknesses of a student's performance.  We ask teachers to 
identify the specific benchmarks student's are not meeting and evaluate exercises that student's can perform within each 
classroom task that will play to that strength.The 2017-2018 year will be the first year where impact teams will be able to 
collect data on how often students are achieving the goals set both by themselves and by teachers in larger groups beyond the 
ELL population. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Not applicable for High School. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Although we did not have students testing this year, in past data has always been used to guide instruction.  For example in 
the 2012 school year, data for one student was unavailable as he was not tested at his intermediate school and had previously 
attended school out of state.  However, the modality analysis of the second student revealed an inconsistency in her 
work.  This was something we were able to use as a starting point when reviewing basic elements such as vocabulary and 
conventions. Our current former ELL tested out while in intermediate school as well, through modality analysis we were able 
to see that he struggled with reading comprehension.  In the past year, we were able to work on focus and summarization 
skills such that his grades have been on a 5-10 point upswing in the past term. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Although we did not have students testing this year, in past data has always been used to guide instruction.  For example in 
the 2012 school year, data for one student was unavailable as he was not tested at his intermediate school and had previously 
attended school out of state.  However, the modality analysis of the second student revealed an inconsistency in her 
work.  This was something we were able to use as a starting point when reviewing basic elements such as vocabulary and

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction is delivered using integrated collaborative team teaching whenever possible where student is in a 
heterogeneous mainstream honors program.  This program creates literacy across the curriculum and aligns with 
cultural and social connections within the curriculum through the use of content texts.  Students are given 
differentiated, challenging work in order to focus on their individual goals and needs across the curriculum.  The ENL 
teacher begins in the English class 5 days per week which may or may not be more than the allotted time, but is seen 
as a value to the student. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Staten Island Technical High School does not have a bilingual program at this time. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Staten Island Technical High School does not have a dual language program at this time. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Students are assigned to classes based on the mandate for advanced (180 minutes) and Intermediate (360 minutes) 
levels of instruction as per the program mandate. Once students are assessed, they are given classroom program that places 
them in an English class with both an ENL teacher and an ELA teacher for a 41 minute period at a rate of either 3x - 5x per 
week as is necessary. In past, we have found that although it has never been the case in our school where students require 
more than the minimum time, we add the support whenever budget allows as students benefit from the added review in 
vocabulary / language acquisition exercise that they do not even realize they are getting.  Outside of the English classroom, we 
do our best to program ENL/ELL students with a foreign language teacher who also has an ENL license (even if not in their 
language), and provide additional tutoring either with a peer or teacher in subjects where they may struggle (This is available 
to all students, not only ENL/ELL). 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   As Staten Island Technical High School supports a the Freestanding ENL model all content area instruction is delivered in 
English in mainstream classes.  Materials specific to language barriers would be reviewed in one or both of the classes set for 
ENL/ELL and Language Arts study. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   To ensure ELLs are properly evaluated in their native language Staten Island Tech communicates with families through letters 
or translated meetings where we offer materials to students for exams, with the exception of English exams, in their native 
language to ensure complete understanding.  Additionally, before each administration of regent exams, a meeting is held with 
Mrs. Sanguinedo, Mrs. Kirschbaum, Mrs. Barnett, and Mrs. Rachel Elfassy, the school's testing coordinator, to review testing 
accommodations are correctly in place for each student. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d.

e. 

Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

    Differentiation amongst ELL subgroups through annotated text, scaffold questioning and close reading specific to the needs 
of each student come about within mainstream classrooms through collaboration of teacher and ENL teacher. Additionally, 
one-on-one instruction once a day allows students to work specifically to their needs. This past year, Staten Island Technical 
High School saw the great need for students to have an outlet for self-expression in ENL/Ell learners and SWDs.  Therefore, we 
wrote a grant to work with Sundog Theatre Arts, Inc., and have a teaching artist come to the school weekly for a 16 week, 
visual arts program.  Students prodeuced various types of art including watercolor, pastel, charcoals, etc. and displayed it at a 
gallery in the programs culmination where they spoke on their work.  It it a program we hope to continue. 
    Although ELL students are few in number Staten Island Technical High School teachers work together using cultural 
influences to instill a greater connection to language both within the school day and with after school clubs such as Mahjong 
Club and Asian American Club to name a few. 
 
a)     Because we are a specialized high school Staten Island Technical High School does not currently have SIFE 
students.  However, the process for identifying students as SIFE must be follew in accordance with CR Part 154, if a student has 
attended school in the United states with interrupted or inconsistent formal education for and are ELLs who have attended 
schools in the US for less than twelve months who are showing literacy below their grade level.  At this point it is important to 
examine the Home Language Survey where prior schooling is indicated and the results of the NYSITELL before conducting an 
NYSED Oral interview, NYSED Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener, and Writing Screener.  Then SIFE status can be determined 
within 30 days of initial enrollment.  
b)     Up until now, Staten Island Tech has not encountered ELLs in US schools less than three years (newcomers). As per the 
mandate for all ELLs in US schools less than three years (newcomers), Staten Island Tech would identify newcomers using the 
Home Language Survey, NYSITELL and Oral Interview (if coming from private school) or ATS as mandated and use Parent 
Choice to predicate the student program  to ensure the best education for the student based on the level and ability shown. 
c)     For ELLs receiving services 4 to 6 years and long term ELLs Staten Island Technical High School would use as much data as 
can be gained from previous schools, through ARIS, HSST(STARS), conversations with previous counselors and current grade 
work to pinpoint weaknesses and build the ELL curriculum to specifically meet the needs of each student.  As part of an School 
Based Option, Staten Island Technical High School teachers participate in tutoring sessions beyond the classroom where these 
skills can be fostered further. 
d)     See C. 
e)     ENL/ELL students who have tested proficient on the NYSESLAT continue to receive ELL testing accommodations for 2 
years.  Additionally, these students are monitored under the auspices of their assigned guidance counselor and Assistant 
Principal, Noelle Sanguinedo, to ensure there is no further need of academic intervention services and their transition is 
smooth. 
  
   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Currently, all Staten Island Technical High School students, are using a paperless classroom design in which students have all 
texts, notes, and Powerpoint/SmartNotebook files available to them on their individual tablets, laptops or individual digital 
devices.  Technology allows students the ability to have notes, texts and other necessary materials translated into their native 
language as well as communicate directly with each teacher without having to ask publicly for assistance, as the notes can be 
copied and pasted into translation software.  In order to increase more scaffolded lessons, Staten Island Technical High has 
also purchased a web-based vocabulary program which allows teachers to individually assign vocabulary practice to students 
at varying grade levels called "The Vocabulary Workshop".  Students are able to go online for free as well and take quizzes to 
learn new words beginning with basic units that are below the levels we use in case their level is below what is intended for 
the grade.  In this respect students not only build knowledge through curriculum and instruction but can seek additional help 
through extended day tutoring which many of the teachers at our school choose as part of their circular 6 option to better 
accommodate student's needs.  All of this technology also allows for an open line of communication directly between the 
student and the teacher so that questioning can be open and answers can be candid and complete. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Programming is done carefully and with consideration to all of the student's needs, including but not limited to: strengths and 
weaknesses in certain subjects, time of day, learning ability, etc.  Once IEP goals are set the student, teacher, and counselor 
must work together to ensure they are on the same path for success, and intermittently check to ensure that if a goal is 
achieved a new goal is set, or on the the other hand, that they have stayed the course.  Currently all classes are taught in 
English. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
In ELA and Math as well as all other academic subjects, Staten Island Technical High School offers as targeted intervention 
programming: 30 minute extended day tutoring time during the school day; teachers provide additional tutoring during their 
professional period when needed, Advanced Placement and regent preparation tutoring is held after school and on Saturdays 
whenever applicable and peer tutors make themselves available to department assistant principals for added support. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    
In the upcoming year it is the goal for Staten Island Technical High School to continue with its expansion of language 
instruction including APEX online language courses in French, German, Spanish, Latin and Mandarin.  Additionally, to better 
accommodate all students including former ELLs, we have created a senior curriculum in English that allows for student choice 
of student in fields including but not limited to public speaking and journalism in addition to the traditional British Literature 
sequence.  This not only allows for greater differentiation in instruction but a greater sense of college and career readiness 
amongst students. 
 
Data has shown that ELL or former ELL students typically excel in mathematics and therefore do not require much intervention 
in that area, but may struggle in life sciences where reading comprehension is a factor, so we have made that particular skill a 
focus in the English/Language Arts curriculum with a focus on the non-fiction aspects in order to mimic the genre. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No current programs will be eliminated at this time. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All school programs as well as after school clubs and activities are offered to both ELL and non-ELL students.  These include all 
academic classes, over 75 extra-curricular clubs including cultural clubs, theater performances and sports programs. 
 
In addition, this year, Staten Island Technical  High School was awarded a grant specifically geared toward ENL/ELLs and 
SWDs for students who wished to participate in Visual Arts.  Those who identified with either group were the first to receive an 
invitation to the program in which a teaching artist was provided by Sundog Theatre Arts, Inc. before it was opened to the 
entire student population.  At the close of the 16 week program,student artwork hung for a full week in the Staten Island 
Museum at Snug Harbor.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Staten Island Technical HS combines a range of materials to support ELLs both within the classroom and beyond.  A primary 
focus school wide is on Oracy.  As a student must present themselves in the world, using their abilities to read, write listen and 
speak, we feel they must begin to master all 4 of these pillars.  Teachers in each subject will ask students to work on video 
presentations, presentations in front of the room, possible dramatic performances and so on where ELLs can take an active 
role while choosing which part, makes them feel most comfortable until they ultimately gain confidence in themselves.  The 
theory is that with practice they will gain the confidence to be in front, but will have taken on a part as the writer, or director 
which uses multiple aspects of language as well.  See also question 6.

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support in Staten Island Technical High School’s ENL program (the only available program at this time) is 
upheld through printed materials in the students native language, test copies for all but English exams provided upon request 
in the students native language and cross curricular inclusion of cultural influences particular to ELL and former ELL students in 
addition to after-school clubs and community outreach programs as they are made available to us.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

ELL services and support continue throughout each grade level as need. Guidance counselors are assigned to all students in 9th 
grade and move with the student throughout their time at Staten Island Technical High School.  The same would be true for 
ENL/ELL teacher Mrs. Dobry.  Subject teachers would join monthly meetings as the students entered their classes.  English 
Language Arts teachers would work daily as a partner with Mrs. Dobry and meet weekly on goal setting during common 
planning time, as well as speak weekly with bi-weekly with the guidance counselor as needed, until certain goals are achieved. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Staten Island Technical HS does not currently share a building. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled students will meet with Mrs. Sanguinedo before the school year begins to establish a timeline for meetings 
with the student and their counselor as well as the parent in order to stay abreast of any concerns or issues the student and/or 
parent may have with the progression of the program.  Additionally, Mrs. Sanguinedo will work with Mrs. Kirschbasum and the 
guidance department to ensure the needs of the student are being met; and will monitor the progress of the student through 
ATS, CAP, STARS and teacher’s anecdotal logs. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

In addition to the APEX online course electives mentioned above, Staten Isand Technical HS runs the largest secondary school 
Russian program in the country. Like all non-ELL students, ELLs are offered Russian, Advanced Placement and/or Russian for 
Business as a foreign language.  Staten Island Technical High School runs both heritage and non-heritage tracks as Russian is 
the only language currently offered to students. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Not applicable as of this version of the LAP. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Mrs. Dobry, ENL teacher, has been attending workshops throughout New York City to gain knowledge of all aspects of ENL/ELL 
and the common core.  Additionally, Mrs. Dobry has made contacts with Assistant Principals and teachers of ENL on Staten 
Island.  Together they are building new curriculum to bolster the program already in place. One major goal is to ensure writing 
across the curriculum.  Additionally, Inquiry/Curriculum Teams in all academic subjects are working to differentiate learning so 
that needs are met for students of all modalities with ideas turn-keyed by Mrs. Dobry based on her experience.   This includes 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

professional development workshops for Common Core Learning Standards and Curriculum Alignment, workshops on using 
the IO Education (Pupil Path/Skedula) tool as a means of connecting to parents, and technology workshops for programs such 
as clicker and smart notebook so that all students can benefit. 
 
As Staten Island Technical High School has a small ELL population professional development is offered/encouraged outside of 
the school building.  However, monthly meetings as an ENL team with teachers, paraprofessionals and counselors allows for 
stronger curriculum development.  Some examples include two, forty-five minute in which we partnered with the district office 
to run workshops for our entire staff on how to differentiate lessons in the classrooms, specific to language acquisition.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Mrs. Kirschbaum and the guidance counselors work directly with the students in a one-on-one format as well as a group 
format in which they push into English and Technology classes for 9  th   graders to discuss transitional issues and needed skills 
as their high school career progresses. 
 
On a bi-monthly basis, members of the Language Proficiency Team push-in to the professional development periods in 
accordance with both a school SBO vote for professional development and compliance with CR Part 80, to review 
differentiation of materials and best practices as well as turn-keyed materials from outside professional developments as they 
arise.  Agenda's and attendance are kept for each meeting including those in which the focus is ENL instruction.  
 
At least once per term, staff is asked to attend a workshop specific to ENL/ELL instruction outside of the provided professional 
development listed above.  This year, we were able to host a district workshop on differentiation for ENL/ELL learners in our 
building, which we hope to do again. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Similar to the way IEPs are reviewed annually, Staten Island Tech would ask the parents of ELL students to come in for an 
evaluative meeting with Mrs. Sanguinedo, Mrs. Kirschbaum, Mrs. Dobry and the student's guidance counselor, in which they 
would be updated on the achievements and obstacles faced throughout the year and contribute to goal-setting for the 
following year.   Mrs. Dobry and the student's English Language Arts teacher would keep track of how the student is meeting 
the common core standards throughout the year based on the skills that each task in the class demand and how well that skill 
is carried out.  Students will have multiple opportunities to meet and master each skill and teachers will be in constant contact 
with the parents and the guidance counselor throughout the year before the face-to-face meeting through the online 
anecdotal process in our online gradebook. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Staten Island Technical High School promotes parental involvement in all aspects of a student’s high school career.  We have 
incorporated technology portals including Naviance and IO Education (Pupil Path/Skedula) for parents to scrutinize their child’s 
progress as well as communicate with SI Technical HS faculty. Additionally, we have parent meetings before a student begins a 
program and after in order to keep parents in the loop throughout their student's journey.  This year we also implemented an 
after school art program (that we hope to continue) for ELLs and SWDs to join general education students in learning art as a 
means of self-expression.  At its culmination, the student work was displayed for one week at the SI Museum with an opening 
gala on the first afternoon, where parents and students were all in attendance.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Mark Erlenwein, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In conjunction with the Home Language Surveys conducted at the entry into Staten island Technical High School, 
those that are entering as former public school candidates are asked to complete a Home Language Preference 
sheet. Each year we ask that students update their information so that the compiled data remains current and the 
lines of communication remain open. At general PTA meetings, interpreters are arranged for through the Office of 
Tranlation and Interpretation with the help of our Parent Coordinator, Barbara Malenfant.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
