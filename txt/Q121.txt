Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The school promotes academic success for all learners as evidenced in our school’s mission statement. The mission 
statement of our building states, “Public School 121 believes that all students can meet high standards of excellence, 
as well as develop social and creative activities and skills through a cooperative effort of the teachers, administrators, 
parents, and community.”  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S.121Q is a Title 1 Pre-K through grade 5 school located in South Ozone Park, Queens. Our school has a total 
population of 954 students coming from diverse backgrounds. The demographics of our school are 36% Asian Pacific, 
18% Black, 12% Hispanic, 2% White, and 32% other. Many of the students in our school receive free lunch making up 
77% percent of the school population. We have a 5% population of English Language Learners and 12% of our student 
population has Individual Education Plans (IEP’s) and receive special education services.  

Our school’s foci continue to be improving our students’ English Language Arts (ELA) performance. This is an area of 
focus for this school year. We aim to focus on rigorous ELA instruction in order to move students towards higher 
levels of achievement this year. We have been emerged in the use of our two reading programs, Wonders and 
Reading Streets, which are integrated reading programs that support the development of a strong reading 
foundation, provide access to complex text, and connect reading and writing. These programs are in alignment with 
the current instructional shifts. They aim to build content knowledge through the reading of fiction and nonfiction 
text, produce high quality text-based written products, and build academic vocabulary through the reading of grade-
level text. Our goal in adapting these programs is to see improvements in our students reading scores at the end of 
this school year.  

School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by welcoming, encouraging, and 
developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. Developing strong family-
community ties is an important element of our school community. We pride ourselves on maintaining frequent 
communication and a culture of trust and positive attitudes among students, staff, parents, and the community. Our 
school has partnerships with businesses such as Swim for Life,Vision Zero, New York City Police Department 
Neighborhood Policing, Trump Pavilion Nursing Home , Make a Smile Foundation, and Smile New York. These 
organizations provide opportunities for our students and parents to engage in meaningful programs. Well-developed 
relationships have also been established with local legislative members. We will continue our Pen Pal partnership with 
the Global Community Collaborative High School, our fifth grade students wrote letters and had the opportunity to 
visit their Pen Pal and sit in a high school class. Our Road Runners program continues to be a huge success. The 
program fostered the social development of students through physical challenges, role modeling and good 
citizenship. Additionally, we have a brand new dance studio and partial sound system courtesy of the Art Space grant. 

 The strengths of our school include rigorous instruction and curriculum which prepare our students for college and 
career readiness. We pride ourselves on the work of collaborative teachers, supportive administrators, and strong 
parent involvement, always keeping the students as our first priority.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Five percent of our student population is made up of English as a New Language (ENL) learners. Our ENL students 
need to be emerged in the English Language through various learning opportunities. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Our priority focus for this school year is Rigorous Instruction, with a key focus on navigating through complex texts. 
Through the use of an anchor text to model comprehension skills and strategies the students will be able develop a 
deeper understanding. During Close Reading the students will be able to set a purpose for reading which guides them 
in the identification of key ideas and details, themes, author's purpose, and making inferences about the text. 
Students are challenged with high level text dependent questions. Students can craft their own discussion questions, 
but no matter who composes the questions the students will be responsible for answering the questions using text 
details and or inference to support their responses. In addition students will continue to be provided with robust 
opportunities to read independently.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Navigating complex texts are essential skills that students need to acquire in order to develop mastery in all academic 
areas. Key details and ideas are critical in identifying the meaning of a text. These skill develop a concrete foundation 
that aids students' abilities to read and comprehend texts across various genres.  

 

Strengths: The key data points below highlight some of the impact of our strength that was noted by reviewers or 
evidenced in student achievement: 

Advance Teacher Rating System:  

  ninety percent of teachers were rated highly effective or effective in Domain 1e (Demonstrating Knowledge of 

Content and Pedagogy) 

  ninety-five percent of teachers were rated highly effective or effective in Domain 1a (Instruction 

Needs: We will focus on rigorous English Language Arts (ELA) instruction in order to move students towards higher 
levels of achievement this year. We will use integrated reading programs, Wonders and Reading Street, that support 
the development of a strong reading foundation, provide access to complex texts, and connect reading and writing. 
Lessons will reflect the updated Next Generation Standards. Although "identifying key ideas and details" are 
embedded in those programs, we feel that we need a stronger emphasis on those skills in order to improve the 
reading ability of our students. Our current performance data support this. We analyzed the results of our Benchmark 
assessments as well as Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System results.  

Needs: The key data points below highlight some of the impact of our challenge noted by reviewers or as evidence by 
student achievement: 

New York State Assessment Performance Data (2017-2018) 

  Grade 3- an average of sixty-one percent of the total possible points were earned for standards RI/RL 3.2. 
  Grade 4-an average of seventy-one percent of the total possible points were earned for standards Rl/RL 4.2. 
  Grade 5- an average of sixty-three percent of the total possible points were earned for standards RI/RL 5.2.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

A compelling reason for effective professional learning opportunities is that student achievement depends on 
rigorous standards and a knowledgeable education team. To have high standards for students , there must be high 
standards for the staff members who work with them. Our Professional Learning Team was created to determine the 
need for and then implementation of beneficial Professional Learning sessions. The team selected the topics which 
would be used during Professional Learning sessions. The administrators, coaches, and outside experts provided the 
training/professional learning for the staff. All teachers participated in the same Professional Learning activities. 

Strengths: The key data points below highlight some of the impact of our strength that was noted by reviews and 
evidenced in student achievement: 

2017-2018 School Quality Guide 

  Ninety-two percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that overall, their professional development 

experiences this year have been sustained and coherently focused, rather than short-term and unrelated.  

  Ninety-two percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that overall, their professional development 
experiences this year have included enough time to think carefully about , try and evaluate new ideas.  

Needs: As a result of the professional learning sessions provided this year, we found that the professional 
development sessions in the area of mathematics which were offered were not beneficial to the teachers of all grade 
levels. Some teachers were required to attend sessions on mathematics topics in which they were successfully 
implementing in their classrooms, while others found themselves needing more grade level specific additional 
support which was not offered during that session. After considering this data, we came to the conclusion that the 
professional learning sessions should be differentiated by grade bands in order to meet the needs of specific grades 
levels of teachers. Teachers will attend a a variety of professional learning opportunities throughout the year that 
would address the needs of individual teachers on specific grade levels based on individual goals, student data, and 
the Advance Teacher Rating System.  

The key data points below highlight some of the impact of our challenge that ws noted by reviewers or noticed in

At PS 121, we pride ourselves on maintaining frequent communication, a culture of trust and positive attitudes among 
students, staff, and parents. Teachers made many attempts to communicate with parents regarding the progress of 
their children. Parents were invited to attend several events throughout the year that allowed them to be involved 
with their children’s learning. Our current data indicate a high level of communication between parents and teachers.  

Strengths: The key data points below highlight some of the impact of our strength that was noted by reviewers or NYC 
School Survey: 

Framework for Great Schools Report 2017-2018: 

  Ninety-nine percent of families say they feel respected by their child's teachers. 
  Ninety-nine percent of families say that their school communicates with them in a language and in a way that 

they can understand. 

  Ninety-eight percent of families say that teachers and families think of each other as partners in educating 

children.  

Needs: This year we focused on improving our school’s strong family-community ties. While we did show 
improvement in the area of parental involvement in the school community, our current data indicate that our focus 
should continue to be on parental involvement in the school community. We want parents to feel that they are a 
welcome member of our school community. We need to continue to build strong partnerships between parents and 
teachers that enrich the school community.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Public School 121 attracts and retains Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) by conducting a three-step interview process. 
The teaching candidates are interviewed in a preliminary interview. The candidates plan and execute a demo lesson. 
Finally the candidates are interview by our panel . Resumes are screened and we strive to hire teachers that hold dual 
state certifications. We only consider candidates who have attended an accredited college. Candidates' prior teaching 
experience and performance ratings are also a priority.  

 

We provide teachers with meaningful opportunities for leadership that are at times paid, challenging and enriching, 
such as curriculum planning, mentoring, coaching, technology integration and professional development. We provide 
time for teachers to collaborate, reflect and develop plans to improve their teaching practices. We seek teacher 
feedback when creating schedules, especially during standardized testing and special events. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Data are analyzed to inform teacher and grade specific professional developments.   

 

Grade conferences and one-to-one meetings are used to extend the discussions.   

 

 New and struggling teachers are mentored on a regular basis.   We have a supportive administration along with 
adequate 

resources and student materials, a safe environment, time for collaboration, ongoing professional development, 
reasonable class

sizes, and support personnel and current technology.  

 

New teachers attend professional development over the summer and continues throughout the school year. Lead 
Teachers help 

analyze data and implement effective instructional practices. New teachers are partnered with veteran teachers. New 
Teachers 

inter-visit classes to observe good practices on their grade. 

The goal is for teachers and paraprofessionals in all stages of their careers to learn from one another. New teachers 
can benefit from the knowledge and experience of their colleagues and new teachers can bring recent training in 
curriculum, classroom management and technology that can inform and reinvigorate long-time teachers. 

Teacher professional learning sessions are differentiated and based on their current needs and performance in 
accordance with The Danielson Framework and their areas of weakness Advance observations conducted by the 
building administrator. Professional Learning Sessions are designed to improve the teaching practices of all 
professionals in the building and are adjusted as cycles of teacher observations are completed to continue to meet 
teachers' needs.

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
The transition plan for preschool children begins with a Parent Orientation and Meet the Staff for the parents on the 
first day of school. At that time, we also provide parents school information, a parent handbook, as well as literature 
on supporting early childhood learners at home. In collaboration with the Parent Coordinator, PTA and the 
administration, we host Curricular Meetings for all grades, including Pre-K and kindergarten. During this session, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

parents are provided with the grade level expectations, as well as specific strategies to help hone in the school to 
home connection. Finally, all parents from Pre-K to 5 are invited to all parent workshops. Preschool students are 
assessed three times a year and results are shared with parents. The results are used to alter small group instruction 
or vertical alignment. There is an assessment checklist which includes numeral assessments: Row 1: 3,5,0,1,4,2 Row 2: 
7,9,8,6,10, color assessment of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, black, white, and brown, counting from 0-5 
and 6-10, identifying the shapes, writing his or her name, identifying the letters of the alphabet, and cutting a sheet of 
paper in order to assess his or her fine motor skills. The school social worker meets with parents and recommends 
intervention services when necessary. Student portfolios are passed on to the kindergarten teachers. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
At PS 121, we believe in collaboration and in using our Professional Learning Community to make decisions regarding 
the selection of assessments. Assessment options are presented as part of the School Leadership Team that contains 
representatives of all stakeholders; in turn, they contribute to decisions by sharing the opinions and choices of their 
constituents. Teachers also have an opportunity to discuss and weigh in assessment options during their secured 
teacher team sessions. Similarly, the administration shares assessment options as well as the final selections made via 
faculty conferences. The MOSL Committee evaluates assessments and makes recommendations for the school year to 
the principal; the principal elected to adhere to the MOSL committee’s recommendations. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement.

Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

Parent Involvement Policy 

 

Statement of Purpose 

 

P.S 121Q teachers and staff are committed to providing a quality educational program that will challenge all children 
to reach their potential. We believe when school and parents work together children succeed in school and 
throughout life. Neither home nor school can do the job alone. Parents play an extremely important role as children’s 
first teachers. Their support for their children and for the school is critical to their children’s success in  

every step along the way. 

 

To ensure that basic skills and knowledge are taught, we will hold educators accountable for effective teaching, hold 
students accountable for learning, and encourage parental involvement in their children’s education. We will 
continually assess student growth in order to provide timely interventions and evaluate our instruction.  

 

Additionally, P.S.121Q teachers and staff will work collaboratively with parents and our community in the 
development, evaluation, and refinement of our Title 1 program. 

 

Parents’ Rights and Responsibilities 

The responsibilities of the school, parents and children in increasing student learning and achievement are Identified 
in our School-Parent Compact. Periodically, parents of participating children are invited to review the compact and 
make suggestions for revisions. 

 

Development of the School Parent Compact 

The development of the School-Parent Compact, as well as the Parent Involvement Policy, is a joint venture between 
parents, teaching staff, members of the School Leadership Team, and our Parent Coordinator. Our Parent 
Coordinator oversees the implementation of these documents as it relates to parents of our students. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

During monthly Parent Teacher Association meetings, which are attended by parents, teachers, the Parent 
Coordinator and Principal, issues related to the education and welfare of our students are brought forth and 
discussed. 

 

Furthermore, during regularly scheduled School Leadership meetings issues are discussed, revised, and updated as 
deemed necessary. 

 

School/Parent Communication 

Communication between the school and parents is one of the many components necessary to the success of our 
students. Teachers meet with parents four times during the school year for Parent Teacher Conferences. There is an 
afternoon and an evening component to accommodate all parents. In addition, starting this year there is the Tuesday 
after school conferences available for parents to meet with teachers. In addition, parents may meet with any 
member of the school community by scheduling an appointment. We have staff members on hand that are fluent in 
Spanish and are available for translation purposes. School bulletins are sent home in a timely fashion in order to 
inform parents of meetings, workshops, and other opportunities available to parents. 

 

Student Goals as per the Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) 

#1--Parent Workshops 

Throughout the school year a number of parent workshops are scheduled. Members of our staff and our Parent 
Coordinator conduct these workshops. Meetings cover many topics including, but not limited to, preparing students 
for the English Language Arts and Mathematics state exams, completing the middle school application, and an open 
house for students entering Pre-Kindergarten, Kindergarten and the Talented and Gifted. Parents are also 
encouraged to suggest meeting topics. As a result of these suggestions, we have begun a series of workshops on 
Health and Nutrition, and continue with our series of workshops on the Common Core Standards, and how they 
relate to student learning, etc. Through collaborative efforts parent workshops will now empower parents to have a 
voice. We feel parents can play as integral part in working with their children to understand central ideas of texts. In 
conversations with parents, we learn about their children. This, in turn, may assist in a child’s decision to research a 
specific topic of interest, and then write persuasively with conviction. 

 

#2—Increase Parent Involvement 

The Parent Coordinator reaches out to the staff members to utilize their expertise in a particular subject area. In 
careful evaluation we already added other topics of a wider range. Each school year we distribute an agenda and a 
folder to each child. This is a crucial tool for the family. It not only contains a place to write homework assignments, 
but it includes a calendar of events, as well as a parent guide.

Workshop are held for parents of Title I students in order to meet the needs of students and their families.  

 

Parents are encouraged to volunteer their time attend parent workshops, Family Fridays, and other school events. 
The Remind Application is used to send out messages for important school events. Parents are encouraged to join the 
PTA and to take on leadership roles by serving as a member of the SLT.  

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

Throughout the year, we have an extensive (and ever growing) list of activities that the parent community can be 
involved in such as the literacy launch, celebration of learning, musical productions, middle school choice night, and 
multiplication bee. 

The scheduling of the workshops will be responsive to the needs of the parents, in order to accommodate 

parents with scheduling concerns .

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and

  Direct Instruction Supplemental Program – P. S. 121 believes that supplemental programs 
should enhance language learning through content area teaching and specific amplified 
instructional strategies. P.S. 121 will have an after school program for ELLs on Wednesdays and 
Thursdays from 2:20-4:20.  There are 15 ELL students who have enrolled in these programs and 
they are from grades 2-5. These students (after NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data analysis) are 
the students who need the most help with language acquisition skills. English is the language of 
instruction, and two teachers will be teaching the after school ESL program.  One teacher will be 
ESL certified and the other will be a Common Branches teacher who will co-teach ESL through 
content. The after school program will begin in November and end in May, with approximately 
45 sessions. However, we will be extending the ESL after school program into June.  This will 
consist of an additional 32 hours which would then have to be paid with T3 funds for a 
supervisor. 
The Columbia Reading and Writing Program,in conjunction with the MYON reading program 
will be used in the after-school program. MYON is an interactive program that teaches reading 
through interactive and technological access to a wide variety of texts and resources. These 
learning programs are at no cost to the program. This after-school program will help the ELL 
students with Math, Science and Social Studies. These students are also students, who after 
studying NYSESLAT, NYSITELL scores and formal and informal teacher assessments, are the 
students who can benefit from additional academic instruction. The after-school ELL teacher, 
who is certified to teach ESL, in conjunction with the Common Branches teacher, will focus on 
teaching strategies to acquire the English language through the use of content areas. Both after 
school teachers will implement various instructional strategies, such as demonstration and 
modeling with use of mentor texts, language enrichment activities, and programs to ensure that 
ELL students meet the standards.  Academic language development focuses on language 
functions, structure, and vocabulary lessons which are all included as part of daily instruction. 
We always work in congruence with the classroom teacher, and instruction is designed to 
facilitate the learning of various proficiency levels. We use Wonders Reading and Writing 
Program for the acquisition of English language skills in ELLs. The ELL after-school program 
utilizes various scaffolding strategies. Our program is student-centered and instruction is based 
on the students’ needs and interests. Our instruction is based upon the Common Core State 
Standards.  The focus of our after-school Title 3 program, is to provide integrated language and 
content-embedded instruction to support language development through language-focused 
scaffolds. In order to provide home language support, the after-school teacher can organize 
collaborative tasks that target content and generate interactions in the home language among 
peers. Tasks should be enriched with academic English language development 
 
The ELL after-school teachers facilitate learning by providing specific, amplified instructional 
strategies to aid in the students’ English language growth. There will be scaffolding techniques 
that are used for academic instruction, including templates and graphic organizers. Language 
learning topics are topics with which students are familiar, and the teacher usually models and 
demonstrates literacy skills. Math activities for students are also enabled by hands-on activities

with manipulatives. These support services will emphasize test-taking strategies for both the 
ELA and Math state tests, ways to decode academic language and a focus on understanding the 
language component in comprehension activities.  
There are standards-based materials that are accessible to students, and these materials include 
easy language books with rich illustrations, books on tape that accompany illustrated texts, 
teaching visuals and leveled books that are related to the students’ cultural backgrounds. 
Students are immersed and surrounded by texts, visuals and a print-rich environment. There are 
also mini-Ipads that the students have access to, in order to incorporate technology into language 
learning. 
All records including student attendance and program notification in parents’ preferred 
languages will be kept in a central location, such as the ENL teacher's office and copies of these 
documents will be kept in the students' cumulative folders.

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
  There are monthly staff development sessions, where the ELL teacher discusses several 
instructional methods that can be used by classroom teachers to aid in achieving English 
language proficiency of ELL students. These topics are presented during staff development 
sessions that will be offered every other month, during Professional Learning sessions. Agendas 
will be distributed with workshop details and attendance sheets are maintained. These sessions 
are held on Mondays on a monthly basis, from 2:30-3:30 p.m. 
The ELL teacher, who is providing these professional developments, will also attend bi-monthly 
meetings with the Borough Field Support Center, in order to receive training on ways to achieve 
academic success for ELL students. The ELL after school teachers are also encouraged to attend 
these sessions, and when unable to do so, is provided a staff development session with the ELL 
teacher who shares this workshop information. Some of the topics to be covered are-Teaching 
ELLS through aligning the Common Core State Standards with Instruction,  Integrating 
Vocabulary through Language, Ways to Scaffold Language etc. Teachers who work with ELLs 
will also be encouraged to attend these monthly meetings with the Borough Field Support 
Center. We are making every effort to encourage non-ELL certified staff who work with ELLs to 
participate in ongoing workshops that are held by the Borough Field Support Center.  
Professional development will positively impact the progress of ELLs because both the ELL 
teacher and classroom teachers will understand how language works well enough to select 
materials that will help them to plan instructional activities that will optimize language and 
literacy learning to avoid linguistic obstacles to content area learning. The rationale for  ongoing 
professional development is that there is always a need for teachers to learn new instructional 
strategies, and gives them the opportunity to practice, research and reflect on instructional goals. 
This professional development is at no cost to the program.

   P.S. 121 Q will have ongoing workshop sessions for the parents of all ELL students. These 
meetings will focus on language development activities, and will be conducted once a month for 
two hours. They will be held on Tuesdays for a total of eight sessions. There is a need for more 
ELL parent involvement in our school, based on parent survey forms. Since there is a correlation 
between successful parent involvement and successful student achievement, parents will be 
informed about language learning activities that they can practice at home. The ELL teacher and 
Parent Coordinator will provide translators at these meetings, and parents will also be informed 
about community activities that will facilitate language learning activities for their 
children.  Invitation letters will be sent home to all ELL parents and these workshop sessions will 
target all parents who are the parents of our current and former ELL students.  Translated parent 
letters will be sent home to notify parents of meetings. 
Mrs. Green, the ELL Coordinator, along with Mrs. Garrett, the Parent Coordinator, will conduct 
these meetings and some topics to be covered are- Ways to help your child with Homework, 
Ways to teach Language on an Everyday Basis, Helping your child through the use of literature. 
Our parent community tends to prefer having workshops during the school day.  Therefore, Mrs. 
Green and Ms. Garrett will be hosting workshops during the school day. These workshops will 
be held on a bi-monthly basis, from 8:00-8:30 a.m. Based on our observations, we will address at 
home techniques to enhance language learning using manipulatives and language learning 
games. These games will also be sent home with the parents.  
Parents will be notified of these meetings by phone calls and letters sent home. These letters will 
be sent home in the parents' preferred languages. Records, such as agendas and attendance sheets 
will be stored in the ELL teacher's office and copies will also be kept in the students' cumulative 
folders.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 The ELL teacher is trained to use a variety of assessment tools, and will utilize formative and summative assessments in the 
beginning, intermediate and advanced range of English abilities to ensure student progress. Currently we are using Reading 
Streets Unit Tests,  ELA Scores, Interim Assessments, Fountas and Pinnell Running Records, and of course, Kid Watching to 
assess the early literacy skills of ELL students.   The ELL teacher will combine students’ informal assessments with standardized 
data to measure individual progress and help drive instruction. Continuous collaboration between the ELL teacher and 
classroom teachers to ensure curriculum alignment and academic progress of ELL students continues to be an ongoing priority 
to achieve this goal and objective. The evidence that P.S. 121 is on track with this goal and objective is the academic progress 
of ELL students as is evident in ELA scores, interim assessments, classroom progress indicators and NYSESLAT scores. Our 
school's instructional plan will include a curriculum that incorporates ways that the academic needs of ELLs can be met after 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

the analysis of instructionally relevant data. 
The EDAT online assessment tool allows the ENL teacher to analyze  the data patterns of our  students which allows the 
teachers to  determine learning groups using all available data. This data allows all teachers to create differentiated activities 
and lessons to address the needs of the ELL students. 
 
  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

To address the needs of ELL students in the areas of reading and writing, the ELL teacher has set up small task-oriented groups, 
in which students have purpose and direction for comprehensive reading assessments and confidence in their writing 
approaches. The ELL teacher provides students who are less proficient in the English language the necessary time to interact 
with those who are more proficient, and also to use Readworks.org, Myon.com and Mathletics.com and other online 
instructional tools that these students can access on their individual mini-ipads.    
Our ELL program utilizes data to create a balanced approach to literacy, including high-quality instructional practices that 
facilitate academic progress. We use the Reading program called Reading Streets. Close Reading Strategies, annotating the 
text, and using text-based evidence questioning are embedded into the program. Students work in specific groups (based on 
learning needs as per data ) looking for text based evidence related to essential questions designed to promote critical 
thinking. 
 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The ELL teacher is trained to use a variety of assessment tools, and will utilize summative assessments in the Entering, 
Emerging, Transitioning,Advanced and Proficient range of English abilities to ensure student progress. Currently we are using 
Reading Streets Unit Tests, ELL Periodic Assessments, Fountas and Pinnell Running Records, and of course, Kid Watching to 
assess the early literacy skills of ELL students.   The ELL teacher will combine students’ informal assessments with standardized 
data to measure individual progress and help drive instruction.   
According to the NYSESLAT Modality Analysis, the majority of our students are proficient in listening and in speaking with 
several students performing in the advanced level of proficiency. Our students are performing lower on the reading and 
writing section of the NYSESLAT. We continue to use the reading program, Wonders, and the program, Reading Streets. These 
programs include a rich vocabulary, and exposes students to a variety of non-fiction literature, with multiple opportunities to 
scaffold students' learning and several ELL resources. 
    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
The ELL teacher will combine students’ informal assessments with summative data to measure individual progress and help 
drive instruction. Continuous collaboration between the ELL teacher and classroom teachers to ensure curriculum alignment 
and academic progress of ELL students continues to be an ongoing priority to achieve this goal and objective. The evidence 
that P.S. 121 is on track with this goal and objective is the academic progress of ELL students as is evident in interim 
assessments and classroom progress indicators. Students are exposed to a variety of non-fiction literature, with multiple 
opportunities to  access several ELL resources. The school leadership, ELL teacher, and classroom teachers use the data results 
from the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT to create an action plan to meet the needs of all of the students. The results help in 
planning instructional curriculum, professional development, academic intervention, and the purchasing of materials in order 
to meet the needs of the ELL students. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Beyond screening and identification for ELL services to support language development, the ELL student also takes part in RTI 
screening to assess whether his/her literacy skills and competencies are meeting grade level benchmarks. If an ELL student is 
flagged as at-risk or below-benchmark on any particular skill or competency, the student should receive targeted instructional 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

support to bolster development in this area. This support should be delivered in coordination with language support services.  
For  ELLs, the first focus should be on improving the quality of core instruction and making sure that most students have 
ongoing, high-quality opportunities-to-learn and are succeeding.  Our school is currently using the Wonders Reading program 
to address the academic needs of these students.  
  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
An analysis of NYSITELL scores for the current year shows that 40% of ELL students are on the beginner level, while the other 
60% were proficient, and did not need ELL services. An analysis of NYSESLAT scores showed that 17% of students are on the 
beginner/entering  level, 23%  are on on the intermediate/transitioning level and 50% are on the advanced/commanding levels 
and 10% are on the commanding level. 
 Our intermediate and advanced ELLs consistently perform better in the areas of speaking and listening than reading and 
writing. Our ELL teachers will use this information to guide curriculum planning and overall learning goals. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

In order to maximize English language acquisition for ELLs, the ESL and classroom teachers will work closely to deliver literacy 
instruction as well as tailor additional content instruction to meet the needs of ELLs. ELLs will be assigned the mandated 
minutes of ESL instruction aligned to CCLS. Students who show insufficient growth on reading assessments will receive an 
additional 30 minutes per day in literacy instruction using a reading intervention focused on helping them achieve grade-level 
proficiency in each essential reading component (phonemic awareness, phonics, letter recognition, and writing).  
Teacher teams, which includes the ESL teacher meet weekly to analyze student data, look at student work, and collaboratively 
plan instructional lessons focused on meeting the needs of our ELL population. The team also meets to analyze and discuss 
data, plan and organize assessments and outline an academic action plan to meet the needs of the students. The school 
leadership, the ESL teacher and the classroom teachers use the data results from the assessments outlined above to create an 
action plan for each student.  
 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The ENL program is a combination of push-in and pull-out program, and students are grouped by grade, and have 
mixed proficiency levels. Our integrated ENL is based on instruction to build English language skills through content 
area instruction. It is delivered by an ELL teacher and a certified content area teacher (i.e., English language arts, 
math, science, or social studies). Both methods of integrated ENL instruction include content area subject matter and 
English language development using ENL strategies. All ELLs and former ELLs up to 2 years after exiting ELL status 
must receive a minimum number of units of integrated ENL. The ESL teachers work collaboratively to plan and 
schedule the program with the assistance of the supervisors in order to make sure that each student receives their 
mandated services he/she is entitled to. All students who are required to receive ESL are being serviced according to 
the mandated times.

Paste response to questions here:    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Our beginning and emerging students receive at least 360 minutes of study per week of ENL instruction.  Our 
transitioning and expanding students receive at least 180 minutes per week of ENL instruction. Weekly, students that are 
Entering (Beginning) and Emerging (Low Intermediate) Levels receive 360 minutes of explicit ENL/ELA instruction in their ENL 
classroom; Transitioning (High Intermediate) and Expanding (Advanced) Levels receive 180 minutes of explicit ENL/ELA 
instruction in their ENL classroom ; and Commanding (Proficient) Level receive 90 minutes of explicit ENL/ELA instruction 
within their classrooms. Teachers push-in to classroomsduring ELA instruction and provide explicit ENL support during this 
time.  The pull-out portion of the program includes small group and/or one-to-one support.  
For at least 2 school years following the school year in which students have achieved Commanding proficiency, our proficient 
students will receive: 
 At least (90 mins.) per week of ENL/ELA or another content area, or other services that monitor and support their English 
language growth. 
 
  
   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   In our push-in ENL program, there are explicit language objectives in English with the appropriate/applicable ELL standards-
based supports for comprehension in order to communicate a clear and explicit purpose for instruction.  There is rigorous 
academic language used by teacher and students in English with the appropriate level of ELL scaffolds for comprehension that 
encourages evidence-based discussions and writing through specific, thought-provoking questions about common text or 
subject matters(including illustrations, charts, diagrams and audio/video).  Instructional approaches include, but are not 
limited to building content knowledge, 
 exposure to the world through reading,  and the implementation of scaffolding strategies for informational texts. These are 
key concepts that are in alignment with the Common Core Learning Standards. Native language support—such as using 
bilingual dictionaries, native language classroom libraries, technology enrichment in the native language, or the buddy system 
are used for the content area in our ENL program.They are givenmaterials in their native language as well as in English. The 
teachers provide the students with extra support by teaching small group lessons and by incorporating group activities into 
their lessons. ENL students with language needs are partnered with students who can assist them in their native language. 
Teachers provide the students with dictionaries in their native language to assist them with the unfamiliar content area 
vocabulary. Word walls with pictures are displayed around the room to help the ENL students learn the content area 
vocabulary.  
 
 
  
    
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

    Our school will maintain accurate student records, and ensure that throughout the year, all students will be evaluated in 
their home languages  as indicated on the HLQ, and maintained in school records.       
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 Sife students are initially assessed by the NYSITELL tests, and upon completion of this entrance assessment, students are 
placed into their specific proficiency levels. The academic instructional plan for SIFE students includes teaching English 
language skills, utilizing easy to read literature, which contains an array of illustrations and large print words. This use of large 
print enables students to make a personal connection to the English language. In addition, the SIFE students are placed in an 
environment which utilizes alternative assessments, such as the students creating illustrations to depict picture to word 
associations.  
ELLs who have been in the country for less than 3 years will participate in small group,task-oriented learning situations that 
guide the production of the English language, both in the verbal and written forms. These students will be supported in the 
classroom with supplementary information, pictures, and vocabulary charts to help them. 
For developing ELL students, the ELL teacher will focus on vocabulary and language development, guided interactions and 
teaching meaning-based context by modeling and graphic organizers. 
      Regarding long term ELL students, the ENL teacher has designed a specific instructional curriculum for these students. This 
plan also includes emphasizing vocabulary and language development and explicit instruction or the direct teaching of 
concepts. 
     We will continue to support our former ELL students for two years after exiting ELL status by providing them with academic 
folders that have content-area, differentiated learning aids and Common-Core learning tasks and tips. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 Special education and the ENL teacher collaborate monthly to determine the short term academic and lingual goals for each 
ELL student with special needs, as these evaluations should be progressive and open to change, as per the student’s individual 
education plan. Differentiated lessons will be tailored in order to meet the academic needs of these students. Teaching 
strategies to facilitate the ELL-SWD students include small group instruction that emphasizes peer group work. The ENL 
teacher will incorporate different ways to present the information, for example, the teacher will provide visual aids or story 
read alongs on tape to address the visual and auditory learners. Students will be given differentiated graphic organizers to 
meet their individual learning needs and styles. The Wonders Reading program, along with the Reading Streets program are 
the programs that we use to address the language learning needs of these students. These teachers use a research-based 
Reading Program, "Fundations "as well as, immersing their students in small guided reading groups aligned to their reading 
comprehension level.  
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our ENL program helps us to meet the diverse needs of our ELL-SWD students within the least restrictive environment. The 
ENL teacher assists the general education teachers in the classroom to provide small-group individualized instruction to these 
students. If the students are not able to achieve mastery of academic skills, the ELL teacher will reteach the skills, through the 
use of simpler text, working within groups to provide peer support, and will try to relate these skills to the students' cultures. 
Fundations and Wonders programs will be used as supplementary phonics programs. The ELL teacher consults the 
Individualized Education Plan for each ELL-SWD student on a consistent basis, to ensure that the academic needs of these 
students are being met. 
The majority of our ENL-SWD children are enrolled in our CTT (Collaborative Team Teaching) Classes. The CTT classes have two 
teachers (one certified in general education, and the other certified in special education). These teachers co-teach, and plan 
lessons that are aligned to the diverse needs of the children. Our SETSS specialists also push-in to classes to provide additional 
academic enrichment.

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 P.S.121 has an after school program for ELLs on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 3:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. that starts in 
December of 2017. ELL students from grades 2-5 will be encouraged to enroll in this program. Instruction will be delivered in 
English and the teacher is a fully certified ELL teacher. She facilitates learning by providing specific, amplified instructional 
strategies to aid in the students’ English language growth. There are scaffolding techniques that are used for academic 
instruction, including templates. Language learning topics are topics with which students are familiar, and the teacher usually 
models and demonstrates literacy skills. Math activities for students are also enabled by hands-on activities with 
manipulatives. Early phonics readers, big book readers, sight word readers, vocabulary cards, graphic organizers and computer 
language learning activities are used to support ELLs. Photo tiles are also a teaching tool that can enhance beginner language 
learning activities.  
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

   P.S. 121 will continue to install and use Promethean boards as instructional aids and it is our goal for every student to be 
afforded the use of Ipads to learn through technology.   
ELLs will be able to enhance their learning by keeping a learning log and researching for their non-fiction reading and writing. 
Many of our ELLs are not afforded the opportunities of using technology at home, so exposure to technology to enhance 
learning is a valuable learning experience. 
We are constantly reviewing our instructional programs and we have been utilizing a new, supplemental  reading program, 
"Readworks" for grades k to 5, in addition to Engage NY ELA. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are encouraged to participate in all programs through letters sent home or meetings with parents. ELL students are 
encouraged to attend the afternoon enrichment sessions, or the after school program. We also have dance, drama, basketball 
clubs and Student Council with which our ELL students are actively involved.  
 We also have an ESL after school program offered to ENL students for reading and math. Parents are contacted by letters sent 
home along with follow-up phone calls. These after-school sessions are twice a week for approximately 45 sessions. 
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our ELL students learn through exposure to interactions with technology, such as Promethean boards and mini I-pads. The 
classroom libraries and instructional materials are aligned with the school’s Common Core curriculum and reflect the home 
language/s of our ELL students. The ENL teacher and classroom teachers have a wide variety of materials to use across the 
curriculum areas. There are book rooms  in the school for the ESL teacher to borrow big books, books on CD, leveled books, 
and picture books. Our library has received new independent and guided reading books aligned to literacy unit themes. 
Students are also provided with mini I-pads for the use of academic enrichment. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 In the ENL program model, native language support is used in the ENL program by the staff that speak the languages of our 
ELL students. Native language books are also available in our classroom and school library. Native language support is 
systematic and available in all classrooms, and is evident through the availability of native language glossaries, dictionaries and 
materials. Children are sometimes paired up with children who speak the same language and are proficient in English.

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All services are provided for ELLs on all levels such as guidance, speech and SETTS.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school does not share a building. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 There is a packet that is sent home to newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year. This packet 
includes fun activities that incorporate language and learning, while offering suggestions for at-home homework help. These 
packets are sent home in translated versions. These packets are also given to new ELLs who register throughout the year. We 
also have parent workshops for parents of newly enrolled ELLs that focus on helping parents to navigate throughout the school 
process.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
  There are periodic staff development sessions, where the ENL teacher discusses several instructional methods that can be 
used by classroom teachers to aid in achieving English language proficiency of ELL students. These topics are presented during 
staff development sessions at scheduled times throughout the year. All teachers of ELLs will be provided with staff 
development sessions, where the ENL teacher will provide the staff with techniques that will support ELLs in academic 
vocabulary development, ways to help ELLs with non-fiction reading and writing, assisting ELLs with the tasks that are present 
in the Common Core Learning Standards etc.   There will be ongoing weekly meetings with the ENL teacher and classroom 
teachers to ensure curriculum alignment. 
The ENL teacher will continue articulation and support for transitioning ELLs by ensuring curriculum alignment between the 
transitioning year's curriculum. 
Professional development dates are monthly and are held on Mondays during the school's professional development sessions. 
 The ENL teacher also attends monthly workshops hosted by Mr. Pierre Galvez that teach different ways and methods to teach 
language and teaching strategies that will enhance the learning of ELL students. These sessions are ongoing and provide 
invaluable insight into the different teaching techniques that can enhance English Language learning, while aligning teaching 
with the Common Core Learning Standards. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

 Some topics that will be covered at professional development sessions for our staff are-  
 -Workshops on key concepts in second language acquisition theory. 
- Workshops on best practices for teaching ELLs in the mainstream classroom. These best practices will be aligned with the 
Common Core State Standards. 
- Workshops on using technology to differentiate instruction.   
  
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
  The ENL teacher will work in conjunction with the school's administrative team to formulate an academic follow-up 
curriculum that will be distributed to those ELL students who will be transitioning to middle/high schools. 
A minimum of fifteen percent  of the required professional development hours will be dedicated to language acquisition, 
including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English 
language learners. For English as a new language teachers, fifty percent of the required professional development hours will be 
dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-
teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction. Agendas and attendance sheets are stored for review. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
There are bi-monthly parent meetings that are facilitated by the ELL teacher that provide information about the goals of the 
ELL program, language proficiency assessment results and student language development needs throughout all content areas.  
The ELL teacher maintains attendance records of parent meetings, which are followed up with phone calls to parents who are 
unable to attend. Convenient times are scheduled for parents. 
Translation services for parents of ELL students, will be provided by " The Big Word" Translation Services.These services will be 
available, if the need arises, at scheduled parent meetings. There will also be translators for ongoing school and /or ELL parent 
workshops. In addition, there will be a translator for telephone translations in anticipated formal interactions or emergency 
situations. These will be provided by over-the -phone translation services. 
There are also ELL parent information sessions, that are facilitated by the ELL teacher and the Parent Coordinator. These 
sessions inform parents on how to interpret test results and how to address their children's  learning needs at home. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

There is an open invitation for parents to visit the school and their child’s classroom regularly.  The school community invites 
parents to speak with their child's class about their native country, a hobby, or their job.  Parents are encouraged to volunteer 
in the classroom, main office, lunchroom, or library; during events or field trips; or in a student club or after-school 
program.  There are monthly Family Fridays where ELL parents are encouraged to visit their children's classrooms and partake 
in academic activities. 
Records are kept of all parent communication in the ELL office. There are dates and times of follow-up phone calls that are

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Evelyn Vadi, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Written and oral language preference data is collected by reviewing the Adult Preferred Language Report forms 
and entered by the school staff into ATS. 

Student registration forms, Home Language Identification Surveys and Emergency Contact Cards are regularly 
generated and reviews are conducted of current ATS reports which include preferred languages for parents of our 
school community. 

Upon reviewing school surveys that were distributed to classroom teachers, parent coordinator and 
administrators, it was evident that school letters concerning after school programs, promotion in doubt, class

placement, student progress, special education and the school programs were often not acknowledged, returned 
or signed by parents of ELL learners, who speak languages other than English. This lack of acknowledgement is 
due to these letters not being written in the native language, therefore leading the school community to provide 
translated versions of all pertinent school communication.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
